All money collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in a special fund in the municipal treasury and shall be used for such purposes as provided by state law, as from time to time amended.

(3)  Upon a first conviction for aggravated driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, pursuant to sections 25-1-1/66-8-102 or any second or third conviction for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, the municipal court shall, as a condition of probation, require the offender to have an ignition interlock device installed and operating for a period of at least one year on all motor vehicles driven by the offender, pursuant to rules adopted by the New Mexico Traffic Safety Bureau. Unless determined by the municipal court to be indigent, the offender shall pay all costs associated with having an interlock device installed on the appropriate vehicles. In no event shall the city be responsible for any of the costs associated with the installation or operation of the ignition interlock device. If an offender drives a motor vehicle that does not have an ignition interlock device installed, the offender shall be in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation. 
(4)  In all other cases municipal court may order an interlock device to be installed on all motor vehicles to be driven by the offender upon the same terms as set forth in the preceding section. 
(d)  Maximum imprisonment for more than one offense in single occurrence.

Sec. 3-5-3. - Zones. 
    In order to carry out this article, there are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the noninstrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone. Such areas and zones are shown on the Four Corners Regional Airport Zoning Map consisting of one sheet prepared by C. C. Cash, City Engineer, and dated, May 9, 1966, which is made a part of this article. The various zones are established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Noninstrument approach zones. A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all noninstrument runways on the airport for noninstrument landing and takeoff. The noninstrument approach zone shall have a width of 500 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 2,500 feet at a distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of a centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of all instrument runways on the airport for instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(3)  Transition zones. Transition zones are established to each instrument and noninstrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable width as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line 250 feet (noninstrument) and 500 feet (instrument) on either side of the centerline of the noninstrument or instrument runway for the length of such runway plus 200 feet on each end and are parallel and level with such runway centerlines. The transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to noninstrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. 
(4)  Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is established as the area within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a radius of 1,000 feet. The horizontal zone does not include the noninstrument or instrument approach zones and the transition zones. 
(5)  Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a distance of 5,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the noninstrument approach zones and transition zones. 
(Code 1969, app. II, § 3) 
Sec. 3-5-4. - Height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the height limit established in this section for such zone. Such height limitations are established for each of the zones as follows: 
(1)  Noninstrument approach zones. One foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the elevation of the end of the noninstrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
(2)  Instrument approach zones. One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway at an elevation of 200 feet above the end of the instrument runway and extending to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway.

Sec. 3-5-6. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Continuation. This article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to this as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing in this article shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the administrative agency to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the city.

Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone but not within the limits of an instrument or noninstrument approach zone or transition zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone. 
(2)  In the areas lying within the limits of the instrument and noninstrument approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the established airport elevation, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such instrument or noninstrument approach zone. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 50 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the exceptions in this subsection shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article, except as set forth in section 3-5-4. 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives or any amendment thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the administrative agency determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the Unified Development Code. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any tree or use his property, not in accordance with this article, may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from this article. Such variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of this article would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will be substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article. 
(e)  Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and to be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

ARTICLE 4. - RESTRICTION ON SALES 

Sec. 5-4-1. - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council finds and determines that the sale of certain types of alcoholic beverages facilitates the cycle of behavior of consuming alcohol in public places, becoming intoxicated, and then committing criminal acts resulting in arrest or becoming unable to care for oneself and being taken into police custody. This behavior often results in injury to the persons or property of both the people engaging in the behavior and other citizens affected by the behavior. The health and safety of these individuals could therefore be preserved by the elimination of these types of alcoholic beverages from the city. The arrest, transportation and incarceration or housing and treatment of these individuals also puts a great burden on the city's tax revenues and does not allow them to be used for other activities that would positively affect the health and welfare of the city's citizens.

(a)  Notice. Upon the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter derives and the certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify all cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the cable act of 1992. 
(b)  Cable operator response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the city, a cable operator shall file with the city its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the commission is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the commission shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city. 
(2)  If the commission takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the commission is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the commission shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the commission needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the commission has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day period, the commission shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received because of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the commission shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the city to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing any time before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the commission shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the commission's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The commission will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The commission may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  Formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the commission shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the commission shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the commission shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the commission determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the commission may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the commission may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest, computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments, retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the commission's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice.

This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the commission is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the commission shall:

(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the commission is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the commission shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the commission needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the commission has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day period, the commission shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received because of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.

In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city with the objector's name and address. 
(f)  Delayed determination. If the commission is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the commission later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the commission shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the commission's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the commission shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the commission will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The commission may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then-current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The commission's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision.

(k)  Appeal. The commission's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Code 1969, § 8A-1-4) 
Sec. 9-1-5. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  Required. Under this chapter, the city may require cable operator information as follows: 
(1)  When the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the commission may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  When initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the commission may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the commission may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.

(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  Commission action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section will be acted upon by the commission. The commission will grant the request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the commission denies the request, the commission shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the commission, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the commission denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days of the commission's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Code 1969, § 8A-1-5) 
Sec. 9-1-6. - Automatic adjustments of rates. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The commission shall review the increase to determine whether the items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the commission makes no objection within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect.

(a)  The city council finds the 1986 and 2006 Surgeon General's Reports concludes that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers; that separation of people and tobacco smoke within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. 
(b)  The council further finds the 1986 and 2006 Surgeon General's Reports conclude that the risk of disease from environmental tobacco smoke is related to the level of exposure over time, and, therefore, a reduction of smoke in city buildings, public places and places of employment constitute a public health priority. 
(c)  The council further finds it necessary to restrict smoking in specific areas not covered by the state Clean Indoor Air Act, NMSA 1978, § 24-16-1 et seq., which calls for no smoking in public places except in certain designated areas.

ARTICLE 1. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 14-1-1. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any section of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one-percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building (i) built, for a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor or, for a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In zones V1-30, VE, or V, the term "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of elevated building, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the boundaries of flood, mudslide, (i.e., mudflow) and related erosion areas having special hazards which have been designated as zone A, M, or E. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See the definition of Flooding. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include longterm storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practice to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system that consists of a levee and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (PL 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, where specified, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-1-2. 
Sec. 14-1-2. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has, pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 3-18-7, delegated the responsibility to local governments to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain and adopt this chapter. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-1-1) 
Sec. 14-1-3. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-1-2; Ord. No. 02-1130, § 2, 5-14-02) 
Sec. 14-1-4. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-1-3; Ord. No. 02-1130, § 3, 5-14-02) 
Sec. 14-1-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter uses the following methods of reducing flood losses: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-1-4) 
Sec. 14-1-6. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-3-1) 
Sec. 14-1-7. - Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard were originally identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Farmington, New Mexico," dated March 1978, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM). The revision of "The Flood Insurance Study for San Juan County, New Mexico and incorporated areas" dated August 5, 2010, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps dated August 5, 2010, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-3-2; Ord. No. 2010-1234, § 1, 8-5-2010) 
Sec. 14-1-8. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-3-4) 
Sec. 14-1-9. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another section of this Code or ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-3-5; Ord. No. 02-1130, § 4, 5-14-02) 
Sec. 14-1-10. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all sections shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the city council, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-3-6) 
Sec. 14-1-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter.

Sec. 14-2-5. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The administrative review board, as established by the community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The administrative review board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the administrative review board may appeal such decision in the manner specified in division 2 of Article 4 of Chapter 2 pertaining to appeal from administrative review board decisions. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving: 
(1)  An appeal, 
(2)  Variance including justification for their issuance, and 
(3)  Shall report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 14-2-4(b) have been fully considered and in conformance with subsections 14-2-5(d), 14-2-5(j)(1), 14-2-5(j)(2) and 14-2-5(j)(3). As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted in subsections (a) through (f) of this section and the intent of this chapter, the administrative review board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances shall be as follows: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in subsection 14-2-5(d). 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria outlined in subsections 14-2-5(f), 14-2-5(h), 14-2-5(j)(1) and 14-2-5(j)(2) of this section are met and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

ARTICLE 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 14-3-1. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, the following are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-5-1) 
Sec. 14-3-2. - Specific standards (Zones A1-A30, AE, AH). 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 14-1-7, subsection 14-2-2(8) or subsection 14-3-3(c), the following are required: 
(1)  Residential construction.

Sec. 14-3-4. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-1-7 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 14-2-4(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Within zone AH or AO, adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Code 1969, § 12A-5-4) 
Sec. 14-3-5. - Standard for areas of undetermined base flood elevation (Zone A). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-1-7 are areas designated as special flood hazards with no base flood elevation data and no floodway designation therefore. For those areas, the following shall apply: 
(1)  All development shall meet requirements of subsections 14-2-2(4), 14-3-1(1)-(7) and 14-3-3(a)-(e). 
(2)  All manufactured homes shall be required to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(Ord. No. 2010-1234, § 5, 8-5-2010) 
Sec. 14-3-6. - Floodways. 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-1-7 are areas designated as floodways. Since a floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodways unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction sections of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR, Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

(c)  Promotional examination. Whenever an adequate number of qualified candidates is available within the city without the necessity of outside recruitment, as determined by the human resources director and the respective department head, a promotional examination may be utilized.

These lists shall include the names of all persons who have successfully completed a class or position examination that was announced as an open competitive examination. 
(2)  Promotion employment lists result from selection processes in which only internal applicants are eligible to participate. These lists shall include the names of those employees who have successfully completed a promotional examination for a position or a class of work. Such lists may be used in conjunction with other recruitment procedures at the discretion of the human resources director. Placement on an employment list shall in no way entitle an applicant or candidate to appointment to any position. 
(b)  Duration of lists. Employment lists may remain in effect for up to one year.

For each additional vacancy, one additional candidate may be eligible for appointment. 
(e)  Removal of names from list. The name of any person appearing on an employment or reemployment list shall be removed by the human resources director if the eligible person requests in writing that his name be removed, if he fails to respond to a notice of appointment mailed to his last known address, or when the list expires, as specified in this chapter. The names of persons on promotional employment lists who resign shall automatically be dropped from such lists. 
(f)  Waivers. Eligible applicants may waive their right to appointment without suffering any loss of status on the employment list by so doing. However, when a candidate has waived appointment two times, his name shall automatically be dropped from such list.

(3)  If a temporary employee is appointed to a regular position, the employee's performance review date shall be established as the effective date of the regular appointment. 
(c)  Acting appointment. For the good of the service or for a temporary job vacancy or for the purposes of providing training, the city manager may assign an employee to a different job classification. Assignment of acting status shall entitle the employee to the salary associated with that job classification for the duration of the assignment, provided such salary is equal to or higher than an employee's current pay rate. The city manager may not assign an employee to acting status for a period of less than one calendar month of duty or more than six calendar months.

(e)  Any employee who has not successfully completed the probationary period shall not be entitled to rights of grievance or appeal as defined by this chapter.

(a)  After the successful completion of the probationary period, each employee shall have their performance reviewed every 12 months and at such other times as deemed appropriate. 
(b)  If the employee disagrees with the immediate supervisor's review, the employee shall file in writing, within ten calendar days, a request with the next level of supervision to review the immediate supervisor's evaluation. This process may continue at the employee's request up the chain of command until the department head has reviewed the matter. The conclusion of the department head will be deemed final and unappealable with regard to that evaluation. If the employee fails to meet the time limits imposed, the process will end and the employee will lose any rights that have not already been exercised in regard to the evaluation. At any step in this progression up the chain of command the employee may stop the process and prepare a written response to the evaluation. That response will be retained in the employee's personnel file, together with the original evaluation.

(3)  If two employees are in positions of direct or indirect supervision through any departmental chain of command and these two employees establish a relationship by marriage, other operation of law, or through lifestyle accommodations being the substantial equivalent of a family relationship, the city manager may transfer one of the employees to a position removed from the supervisory control of the other if it is determined that such transfer will serve the best interests of the city. 
(4)  Except as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, no applicant or employee who is a relative of another city employee shall be prohibited from seeking and holding a city position or from promotion within the municipal service, provided such recruitment or promotion is conducted in accordance with this chapter and any applicable administrative regulations.

Sec. 21-12-8. - Determination of representation. 
(a)  Any employee organization may file a written request with the city manager asserting that a majority of the members of a bargaining unit of the city desires to be represented by it for the purpose of collective bargaining and asking to be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative. The request shall include a demonstration of support of at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit by means of a dated membership list or signed and dated membership cards of those employees desiring representation. Notice of the request shall be posted by the city personnel department in a place conspicuous to city employees in the bargaining unit on the next working day following the filing of the request. 
(b)  Other employee organizations may file, within ten days after the posting of the notice of the request as specified in subsection (a) of this section, a written claim with the city manager showing a demonstration of support of at least ten percent of the employees in the bargaining unit by means of a dated membership list or signed and dated membership cards of those employees desiring representation. Notice of this claim shall also be posted by the city personnel department in a place conspicuous to city employees in the bargaining unit on the five calendar days following the filing of the claim. 
(c)  Upon authentication of the list or cards, the city manager shall so advise the board, which then shall call and hold a representation election within 45 days from the date that the appropriateness of the bargaining unit is determined in order to determine whether an employee organization shall be the exclusive bargaining representative for the unit. Such election shall not be held if: 
(1)  There is currently in effect a lawful written agreement between the city and an exclusive bargaining representative for the bargaining unit involved; and 
(2)  Within the preceding 12 months there has been held a representation election or a decertification election for the bargaining unit; or 
(3)  In the opinion of the board, after holding such hearing as may be appropriate, the bargaining unit described in the request for representation is not an appropriate unit in accordance with this article or such appropriateness has not yet been determined by the board. If the board subsequently determines that the requested bargaining unit is appropriate, the board shall then call and hold a representation election. 
(d)  The board shall call and hold all elections within the time limits established by this article and according to the following: 
(1)  Included on the ballot in a representation election shall be any employee organization which has submitted evidence of support of at least 30 percent of the city employees in the bargaining unit in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, any employee organization which has submitted evidence of support of at least ten percent of the city employees in the bargaining unit in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and a choice for no representation. The choices on a ballot in a decertification election shall be the incumbent exclusive bargaining representative and no representation. 
(2)  Voting shall be by secret ballot. 
(3)  All city employees in the bargaining unit involved shall have the right to vote. 
(4)  If the majority of the city employees in the bargaining unit vote in favor of representation by an employee organization for the purpose of collective bargaining as provided by this article, the city manager shall certify that employee organization as the exclusive bargaining representative for the bargaining unit. If a majority of the employees in the unit do not vote for representation by an employee organization, the unit shall not be represented. Majority is defined as the majority of the eligible members of the bargaining unit, not a majority of those employees who actually vote. 
(e)  Election disputes shall be resolved by the board. If an election occurs involving more than one employee organization in which no choice on the ballot receives the vote of a majority of the city employees in the bargaining unit, a runoff election shall be held within 30 days with a choice consisting of the employee organization receiving the greatest number of votes in the original election and the choice of no representation. A runoff election may occur only if the combined votes for the two or more employee representatives comprise a majority of the bargaining unit. The determination of representative status in such runoff election shall be governed by subsection (d) of this section. 
(f)  The certified exclusive bargaining representative shall represent all employees covered by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. 
(g)  The decertification of any employee organization which has been recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit may be effected by the filing of a written request for decertification supported by either a showing that 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit seek to have a decertification election or a statement by city government that it harbors a good-faith doubt that the exclusive bargaining representative has the support of the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. If, in the opinion of the board, the showing of interest in support of such a petition is sufficient or, in the case of a petition filed by city government, there is objective evidence to support a good-faith doubt as to the majority status of the exclusive bargaining agent, the board shall call and hold a decertification election within 45 days from the date of the receipt of the request. The ballot for decertification will include the choice of the exclusive representative and no representative. If the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit do not vote in favor of the exclusive representative, the city manager shall decertify the exclusive representative. 
(h)  No decertification election shall be held if within the preceding 12 months the board has held a representation election or a decertification election for the bargaining unit. 
(i)  Except as prohibited by (h) above, a petition for decertification may be filed at any time, and if the bargaining representative is decertified any obligation to bargain will cease and any collective bargaining agreement will automatically terminate.

(a)  City government and any employee organization recognized as the exclusive representative for a unit, through their designated agents, shall bargain concerning all wages, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment not in violation of law or local ordinance. The methods and procedures of initial employment, establishing classified and unclassified employees, performance evaluations, promotional procedures, the right to reprimand and discharge employees are nonnegotiable issues. However, the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement which has been ratified and approved by the city council shall, where in conflict with any other section of this chapter, govern. The duty to bargain includes an obligation to confer in good faith, with respect to wages, working conditions and terms and conditions of employment, to execute a written contract incorporating any agreement reached, but does not require either party to agree to a specific proposal or make a concession. 
(b)  The duty to bargain on economic issues is limited to the funding appropriated by the city council. Multiyear agreements are subject to the city council appropriating sufficient funds to fund the collective bargaining agreement for subsequent years.

ARTICLE 5. - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT 

Sec. 22-5-1. - General policies. 
(a)  General use. PIDs should be utilized solely in connection with the financing of public infrastructure improvements for development of residential projects, master planned communities or substantial commercial development and redevelopment. Such financing may include providing an enhanced level of public infrastructure improvements amenities and/or services, in accordance with the Act [Public Improvement District Act, §§ 5-11-1 through 27 NMSA 1978]. In order to avoid inefficient use of the limited resources of the city, unless otherwise agreed by the city council, PIDs will not be approved to finance less than $5,000,000.00. The city's approval of a PID shall be based on an applicant's demonstration, to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, that the PID will provide a benefit to the end-users of the PID-financed public infrastructure improvements or to the city, which benefit may include, without limitation, additional amenities, services, increased quality of development or pricing benefits. A master planned development which has had a fiscal impact analysis which demonstrates that the cost of infrastructure delivery to the development will not have a net cost to the city will be deemed to have met the end-user benefit requirements of the city. Public improvements financed by a PID should conform to applicable city policies for development. In the event that the city imposes "impact fees" (as defined in the Development Fee Act [NMSA 1978, §§ 5-8-1 through 5-8-42]), public infrastructure improvements financed by a PID may qualify for credits against facilities' fees (as provided in NMSA 1978, § 5-8-15), or may qualify as obligations of the developer constructed in lieu of imposition of certain impact fees, to the extent allowed by law. Except as expressly agreed by the city based upon its determination that city-owned utilities will not be adversely affected, utilities which compete directly or indirectly with city services shall not be financed through PIDs. Real property dedications and conveyances required by existing city policies for development, growth management and conservation shall remain in effect notwithstanding the establishment of a PID. 
(b)  Costs and expenses. Unless otherwise agreed by the city, all costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the review of a PID application and the formation of a PID shall be paid by the applicant through advance payments as provided in subsections 22-5-4(a) and 22-5-5(a) of this article. After preliminary approval, if applicable, costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the application and formation of a PID shall not be liabilities of the city. Costs and expenses shall include the costs of services rendered by city staff and services rendered by outside consultants who may be retained by the city including, but not limited to, bond counsel and other attorneys, financial advisers, engineers, appraisers, and tax consultants at the rates normally charged by those consultants. 
(c)  Reimbursement. If authorized by the PID, all or part of such costs may be reimbursed to the applicant from a PID tax levy, PID special levies, PID revenues or PID bond proceeds, provided, that such reimbursement shall be in conformity with federal law, state law and these guidelines. Except as otherwise agreed by the city, PIDs will construct or finance improvements on such terms and with such persons as the PID board of directors determines to be appropriate, in accordance with section 5-11-10D. of the Act as amended. Public infrastructure constructed within the boundaries of the PID may be dedicated to and accepted by either the city (upon completion of construction in accordance with all city requirements and ordinances) or the PID (in accordance with section 5-11-16 of the Act). Unless otherwise agreed by the city, all costs of administration and operation of the PID and the operation and maintenance of public infrastructure in the PID which has not been dedicated to and accepted by the city shall be the responsibility of the PID, the applicant, applicable homeowners' associations, or any combination of the foregoing, as may be acceptable to the city and the PID. 
(d)  PID board of directors; delegated authority. The PID initially shall be governed by a board of directors comprised of members of the city council, ex officio, or, at the option of the city council, five directors appointed by the city council which directors may include representatives of the applicant (the "PID board"). The city council may, in accordance with law, delegate certain responsibilities of governance of the PID to public officials employed by the city. The day-to-day responsibilities of the PID may be performed by outside personnel pursuant to an agreement (including a PID development agreement, constituting a "development agreement" pursuant to section 5-11-10A.(2) of the Act), or the city staff (which development agreement may be denominated a "PID development agreement" or otherwise, at the parties' discretion, in order to avoid confusion with other development agreements entered into by the parties with respect to real property within the city). Each PID development agreement shall comply with this article and the Act; provided that the PID development agreement may contain certain terms and conditions more stringent than those set forth in this article. On a date not more than six years after the formation of a PID, new PID board members shall be elected or the governance of the PID shall revert to the city council, in accordance with section 5-11-9C. of the Act. 
(e)  No impact on city. Unless otherwise agreed to by the city, the PIDs must be self-supporting with regard to operations and maintenance of PID financed public infrastructure until the dedication of the infrastructure to the city and the acceptance of such improvements by the city, and until such time no city funds shall be used for PID purposes; funds for operation and maintenance of public infrastructure improvements may be financed by a PID in accordance with the Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which may be contained herein, neither the city's property, the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the city shall be pledged to the payment of any PID obligation or similar indebtedness. Applicant shall demonstrate that the amount and structure of debt of a PID should not have any direct negative material impact on the city's debt ratings with Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investor Services, Inc. or any other nationally recognized bond-rating agency service then rating the city's outstanding bonds. 
(f)  PID development agreement; feasibility reports. The amount, timing and form of financing to be used by a PID shall be determined by the PID board based upon a project feasibility report and established by agreement of the city, the PID and the applicant through a PID development agreement.

(Ord. No. 2008-1199, § 3, 4-8-08) 
Sec. 22-5-4. - Application and approval process. 
(a)  Application submission. Ten copies of an application for the formation of a PID and an application fee of $50,000.00 (the "application fee") shall be submitted to the city manager. An applicant may elect to file the application after preliminary approval has been granted by the city council, or an applicant may elect to proceed without preliminary approval. No application fee will be required for an application for preliminary approval. The city may require deposit of an additional application fee in an amount necessary to pay its actual third party costs, if at any time during the application process it appears that the $50,000.00 application fee will not be sufficient to pay such costs. 
(b)  Application fees. The application fee shall be utilized by the city for initial application review and project feasibility analysis, including the payment of the city's financial and legal advisors, at their customary rates, to assist in the evaluation of the feasibility of the proposed PID project. Ten thousand dollars of the application fee shall be nonrefundable. The balance of the application fee shall be used by the city in connection with its review of the application. If the applicant withdraws its application prior to final city action on the application, the city shall remit the unused portion (if any), of the application fee (but not the nonrefundable $10,000.00 portion) to the applicant. Upon the applicant's request, the city will provide an accounting of expenditures of funds advanced. Any unused portion of advances shall be refunded to the applicant at such time as the city determines that all costs and expenses have been paid. The city and its legal consultants shall use reasonable efforts to determine whether any features of a PID proposed in an application appear not to be feasible, and to advise the applicant early in the review process, for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary additional costs of review. 
(c)  Post application conference. After the application fee has been submitted, the city manager will arrange a conference with the appropriate PID review staff for the purpose of reviewing the application and determining whether the application is complete. The PID review staff will review the application and conduct the initial conference within 15 days following receipt of the application and payment of the application fee. 
If, following the application conference or any other time during the application process, the PID review staff requests additional information, the applicant shall provide any and all supplemental information requested, in accordance with the provisions of subsection 22-5-3(10) of this article. 
(d)  PID review staff report. After analysis of an application as supplemented, the PID review staff under the direction of the city manager or his/her designee, will prepare a report including recommendations relating to the PID, and an analysis of the impact of the formation of the PID and its effects on the city. The report may provide a recommended disposition of the application and any additional requirements that are recommended in connection with the applicant and/or the PID. The city shall complete the analyses and report concerning the application within 30 days following the initial application conference. Recommendations of the PID review staff are advisory and are not binding on the city council. 
If all costs billed to or incurred by the city have been paid by the applicant by a date at least 14 days prior to the date of the meeting of the city council at which the appropriate resolution(s) approving the application is to be introduced, and if the application meets the qualifications provided herein, the application, along with any report and recommendations by the PID review staff, will be forwarded to the city council, along with drafts of the appropriate implementing resolution(s). 
(e)  PID development agreement. The applicant and the staff of the city shall coordinate a schedule of events for formation of the PID and shall negotiate an appropriate PID development agreement between the city and the applicant which shall be entered into prior to formation of the PID and which, if approved by the city council, may incorporate the recommendations of the PID review staff relating to such PID, and any other restrictions, provisions and agreements required by the city. 
(f)  Existing agreements. Agreements by and between the city and the applicant relating to the provision of infrastructure within the boundaries of the PID may exist prior to the formation of the PID (the "existing agreements"). To the extent of any inconsistency between the existing agreements and the PID development agreement relating to the provision of infrastructure within the boundaries of the PID entered into upon formation of the PID, the provisions of the existing agreements shall be deemed amended and the provisions of the PID development agreement shall control. The existing agreements relating to the provision of infrastructure proposed to be furnished by the PID shall be identified in the application and how those existing agreements are expected to be modified shall be described. 
(g)  Approval of PID formation and PID financing. The city council may consider the granting of formal approval to the formation of the PID based on the terms of the PID development agreement which may be approved prior to or concurrently with the approval of the formation of the PID. The city council may include in its approval of the formation of the PID the issuance of one or more series of PID bonds, subject to the terms and conditions of the PID development agreement. The city council's approval of PID formation and issuance of bonds shall be conditioned on the requirement that the PID shall utilize bond counsel, underwriters and/or other consultants acceptable to the city. PID development agreements shall not be amended without the express written approval by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2008-1199, § 4, 4-8-08) 
Sec. 22-5-5. - PID operations and debt financing. 
(a)  PID administration expense fee. In addition to the amounts set forth in subsection 22-5-4(a) of this article, upon formation of a PID the applicant shall deposit with the PID a nonrefundable administrative expense fee (the "administrative expense fee") in the amount of $5,000.00. The administrative expense fee shall be applied by the PID to the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the formation, election costs, administration, operation and maintenance of the PID or its public improvements. From time to time, upon depletion of the administrative expense fee, the PID may request, and the applicant shall promptly deposit with the PID, additional amounts deemed by the PID to be reasonably necessary for the purposes contemplated in this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the reimbursement of such expenses from PID taxes, levies, charges or bond proceeds, as permitted by the Act. 
(b)  Administration, operation and maintenance charges. In order to provide for the PID to be self-supporting for its administrative, operation and maintenance expenses, and (if applicable) to finance services in addition to those provided by the city, the city may condition its approval of a PID upon the PID's annual imposition of up to $3.00 per $1,000.00 of net taxable value for all real and personal property in the PID, unless a higher rate is approved in accordance with section 5-11-23 of the Act. The PID's imposition of such administration, operation and maintenance charges would not be a tax or charge of the city, but would be imposed in accordance with the provisions of section 5-11-23 of the Act, as amended, upon the PID taxable property, for the administration, operation and maintenance of public infrastructure which is not city-owned infrastructure otherwise maintained by the city. However, to the extent permitted by law, the PID shall be entitled to charge such rates, fees and charges to benefited property owners and users as are necessary to address any shortfall in the expense required to operate and maintain the PID's improvements. Such rates, fees and charges shall be established in the PID development agreement. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of a PID to impose a special levy or other PID charges for administration, operation and maintenance expenses to the extent permitted under the Act and determined to be feasible by the city or the PID board, as applicable. 
(c)  General obligation bonds. General obligation bonds of the PID shall be payable from an ad valorem tax on all taxable property located within the PID designated by the general plan for the PID as subject to the PID property tax as required by the Act. 
(1)  An applicant for general obligation bonds shall describe to the PID board in a project feasibility report prepared by a qualified professional reasonably acceptable to the city, the following: 
a.  The current direct and overlapping tax and assessment burden on the taxable property that is proposed to be taxed and the fair market value and assessed valuation of the taxable property as shown on the most recent assessment roll. 
b.  The projected amount and timing of PID general obligation bonds to be issued. 
c.  The projected market absorption of development within the PID. 
d.  The effect of the PID bond issuance on PID tax rates, calculated at the beginning, middle and end of the market absorption period or based on the phasing of the project to be financed, as applicable. 
e.  An estimate of the applicant's construction costs associated with the public improvements, in excess of the estimated PID funded costs of the project. 
f.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement. 
(2)  The projected tax rate for debt service set forth in the feasibility report shall be established in the PID development agreement, and may include provisions which: 
a.  Limit the maximum tax rate that will be imposed by the PID for the payment of debt service on PID bonds; 
b.  Require a contribution agreement from the applicant for the payment of debt service in the event of a shortfall in revenue from the PID tax revenues projected in connection with, and at the time of, PID formation; or 
c.  Establish, to the city's satisfaction, other protection for homeowners or other end-users of the property located in the PID against excessive tax rates in the event that PID indebtedness exceeds PID tax revenues available to pay debt service in any particular year. 
The PID shall exercise its foreclosure rights associated with the nonpayment of property taxes by owners of property located within the PID and shall reimburse the applicant, upon the applicant's written request, for any payments made by the applicant to cover shortfalls in revenue necessary to pay debt service resulting from the nonpayment of property taxes by such owners, such reimbursement to be made only if funds are available therefor from the proceeds of sales of such properties. 
(d)  Special levy bonds. Special levy bonds shall be secured by a first lien (co-equal to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments) on the property benefited in the manner contemplated by section 5-11-20G. of the Act. 
(1)  Applicants for special levy bonds shall describe in each project feasibility report, the following: 
a.  The current direct and overlapping tax assessment burdens and special levy on real property to comprise the PID and the full cash value and assessed valuation of that property as shown on the most recent assessment roll. 
b.  The projected amount and timing of PID special levy bonds to be issued. 
c.  The projected market absorption of development within the PID. 
d.  The special levy burden to be placed on the prospective assessed parcels and the anticipated methodology of assessment. 
e.  An estimate of the applicant's construction cost associated with the public improvements in excess of the estimated PID funded costs of the project. 
f.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee by the applicant. 
(2)  Unless otherwise agreed by the city at the time the PID is formed, the maximum allowable rate of special levy for residential property shall not cause the total tax and assessment obligation for such property, including projected ad valorem taxes, special levies and special assessments, to exceed 1.99 percent of the anticipated market value of residential property as determined by a then current MAI appraisal. The 1.99 percent shall include all known and authorized, but unissued debt and any other anticipated fees or assessments which may be imposed by the city or special district on a property within the PID - i.e., special assessment districts, including the proposed maximum special levy, except service charges for utilities and refuse. The PID shall exercise its foreclosure rights associated with the nonpayment of special levies and special assessments by owners of property located within the PID and reimburse the applicant, upon the applicant's written request, for any payments made by the applicant to cover shortfalls in revenue necessary to pay debt service resulting from the nonpayment of special levies and special assessments by such owners. 
(3)  The total principal amount of all proposed bonds, excluding the amount of any debt service reserve funds, shall not exceed 33 percent of the appraised value of the property included within the PID, as established by the MAI appraisal. However, applications showing a land value to debt ratio of four to one or better shall be preferred. 
(4)  For special levy bonds, the estimated special levy revenues or for general obligation bonds, the general ad valorem tax revenues, collected by the PID shall at all times be sufficient to pay all estimated operating and maintenance expenses and provide a minimum ratio of 1.1 times projected annual debt service on all special levy tax bonds or general obligation bonds, whichever is applicable, proposed to be issued for the PID. However, applications showing a revenue to debt service ratio of 1.25 or better shall be preferred. 
(e)  Revenue bonds. Revenue bonds shall be payable from rates, fees and charges generated with respect to a PID revenue source. 
(1)  An applicant for revenue bonds shall describe in each project feasibility report, the following: 
a.  The current fee structure for comparable services or otherwise incurred by persons who would be responsible for paying the proposed rates, fees, and charges. 
b.  The revenue source and the adequacy of revenues from which bonds shall be payable. The city reserves the right to require the applicant to produce such independently prepared feasibility studies or reports as it deems necessary to confirm the amount and availability of revenues. 
c.  The projected market absorption of development within the PID. 
d.  The projected amount and timing of PID revenue bonds to be issued. 
e.  The financial impact of the proposed rates, fees and charges on prospective benefited residents or other users of such public infrastructure improvements. 
f.  An estimate of the applicant's construction cost associated with the public improvements in excess of the estimated PID funded costs of the project. 
g.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee by the applicant. 
(f)  Suitability. The city may require that the PID only have the power to sell the proposed bonds to suitable investors. If the city chooses to impose limitations on the PID's power to sell the proposed bonds to suitable investors and the proposed bond issue is not rated (either on its own merits or by the use of appropriate credit enhancement) in one of the three highest rating categories used by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or any other nationally recognized bond-rating agency service, then the bonds must have minimum denominations of $100,000.00 and be available for purchase and restricted with respect to resale to "Qualified Institutional Buyers" (as such term is defined in Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Council) or to "accredited investors" (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Rules Governing the Limited Offering and Sale Securities without Registration under the Securities Act of 1933). The city may choose to have investor suitability achieved through the rating requirements set forth in the preceding sentence or the establishment of large minimum denominations (e.g., not less than $100,000.00) and, if the city determines it is appropriate, covenants limiting secondary market sales of PID bonds through registered broker-dealers. Notwithstanding the restrictions pertaining to public sales and private placements of bonds which the city may impose pursuant to this section, the restrictions may be modified or relaxed if other financing structures or features are presented which, in the sole discretion of the city council, provide other means to address investor suitability concerns. The minimum denomination requirements set forth above for PID bonds which are initially issued without rating shall not continue to apply if the PID subsequently obtains a rating in one of the three highest rating categories as provided in this section. 
(g)  Bond counsel. The PID board shall retain qualified bond counsel to act as bond counsel in connection with the issuance of any PID bonds. From time to time the city may request from bond counsel such opinions as it deems necessary in connection with the formation and activities of the PID. 
(Ord. No. 2008-1199, § 5, 4-8-08) 
Sec. 22-5-6. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Contribution. At the time the PID is formed financial projections must demonstrate that the applicant shall provide over the life of the project at least $0.25 in infrastructure or community improvements (which may include, for example, dry utilities and other improvements for the benefit of the property owners within the PID, irrespective of whether such improvements are publicly or privately owned) for each $1.00 of bonds of any type to be issued by a PID to finance public infrastructure purposes, except as otherwise determined by the city in its discretion. The city, in its discretion, may condition approval of PID formation on additional financing requirements, including, without limitation, the deposit of cash or a letter of credit (or similar credit facility) as security for completion of a portion of the infrastructure development as specified in the PID development agreement. If agreed to by the city or PID board, as applicable, in the discretion of the city or PID board, infrastructure and community improvements constructed or acquired by the applicant prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the formation of the PID may be included in calculating the applicant's compliance with this section 22-5-5; provided, that no improvements which have not already been constructed or acquired shall be included in that calculation unless the completion of the improvements is guaranteed or secured by an appropriate completion bond, cash deposit or other security acceptable to the city or PID board, as applicable.

(c)  Indemnity. So long as the applicant owns 50 percent or more of the undeveloped land within the boundaries of the PID, the city may require the applicant (or such other third party acceptable to the city and the PID), to indemnify and hold harmless the city and the PID and their officers, agents and employees from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in any proceeding challenging the formation, operation, or administration of the PID, the offer and sale of PID bonds, and the levying by the PID of any tax, assessment, special levy or charge in accordance with the Act. 
So long as the applicant owns less than 50 percent of the undeveloped land within the boundaries of the PID, the city may require the applicant (or such other third party acceptable to the city and the PID), to indemnify the city and the PID and their officers, agents and employees from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in any proceeding challenging the formation, operation, administration of the PID, the offer and sale of PID bonds, and the levying by the PID of any tax, assessment, special levy or charge in accordance with the Act. 
The applicant shall not be required to indemnify the city, the PID or their agents, officers or employees against any liability or claim relating to the continuing operation or maintenance of the public infrastructure financed by the PID after it is dedicated to and accepted by either the city or the PID.

In making that determination, the city council may consider an opinion of an underwriter with a reputation satisfactory to the city council, that the particular features of the PID, the proposed projects and the bonds proposed to be issued can be successfully marketed and that the plan of finance is feasible. 
(h)  Purchaser disclosure; marketing materials. Each purchaser of real property located in the PID shall execute an acknowledgment of the PID disclosure form.

(Ord. No. 2008-1199, § 6, 4-8-08) 
ARTICLE 6. - TAX INCREMENT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS (TIDD) 

Sec. 22-6-1. - General policies. 
(a)  Purpose. This article is intended to serve as guidelines for the purpose of considering and, as appropriate, approving the establishment of tax increment development districts (TIDD) and the issuance of bonds of such districts pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Increment for Development Act, (NMSA 1978, §§ 5-15-1 through 5-15-28) hereinafter the "Act." The purpose of this policy is to enable the city to make a reasoned judgment concerning the terms and conditions upon which to approve the formation of a TIDD and to provide procedures for the city to consider TIDD applications. This article shall apply to applications initiated by the city; an application may be submitted by any councilor, the mayor or his designee. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are as defined in the Act. 
(b)  Purpose of public infrastructure. TIDD's should be utilized to provide a funding mechanism to fund public infrastructure necessary to support economic development or redevelopment that facilitates and supports development and job creation that would otherwise be funded and constructed in whole or in part by the city using other tax or utility revenues. It is not intended that TIDD's authorized by this article should be used to finance or construct infrastructure that is required by city ordinance, regulation or policy to be constructed at the expense of a private developer. Public infrastructure financed by a TIDD may (i) enhance the sustainability of the local, regional or statewide economy, (ii) support the creation of jobs, school sites and facilities and/or workforce housing and (iii) generate tax revenue for the provision of public improvements. 
(c)  Compliance with city policy. Public improvements financed by a TIDD should be in conformance with applicable long-range city policies for development; other ordinances applicable to the affected land including annexation ordinances and any related annexation agreements and all supplements and subsequent enactments relating to these measures. Existing city policies for development, growth management and conservation shall remain in effect and shall not be waived or relaxed upon the creation of a TIDD. The TIDD may use bond proceeds or other TIDD funds to purchase land, including public rights-of-way or other real property to be used for public infrastructure improvements. 
(d)  Costs and expenses. Unless otherwise agreed by the city, and unless the application is initiated by the city, all costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the application and formation of a TIDD shall be paid by the applicant/landowner through advance payments as provided in sections 22-6-4(b) and 22-6-5(a) of this article. Unless the application is initiated by the city, after preliminary approval by city council, costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection with the application and formation of a TIDD shall not be liabilities of the city. Advance payments shall include payments for services rendered by city staff, services rendered by outside consultants who may be retained by the city including, but not limited to, bond counsel and other attorneys, financial advisers, planners, designers, engineers, appraisers, and tax consultants. If the city uses outside consultants as "staff," such as attorneys or engineers, those consultants shall be paid their normal rate for services. 
(e)  Reimbursement. Subsequent to the approval of an application for formation of a TIDD by the city, and after authorization by the TIDD exercising its sole discretion, all or part of such advance payments made by the applicant shall be reimbursed to the applicant or to the TIDD to the extent permitted by state or federal law, from the proceeds of bonds, tax increment revenues or other legally available revenues of the TIDD. Section 20(B) of the Act requires property owners to contribute a minimum of 20 percent of initial infrastructure cost prior to the issuance of gross receipts or property tax increment bonds. 
(f)  TIDD board of directors; delegated authority. The TIDD shall be governed by a board of directors comprised of members of the city council, ex officio, or, at the option of the city council, five directors appointed by the city council which directors may include representatives of the applicant/landowner, (the "TIDD Board"). On a date not more than six years after the formation of a TIDD, new TIDD board members shall be elected. The city council may, in accordance with law, delegate certain responsibilities of governance of the TIDD to a committee as approved by the city council. The day-to-day responsibilities of the TIDD may be performed pursuant to an agreement with outside personnel (including a development agreement entered into pursuant to the Act), or city staff. Advisory committees may, at the option of the TIDD board, be utilized. An applicant may request the formation of a single TIDD or multiple TIDDs, which are designed to finance public infrastructure projects to serve separate, but related land uses, and which rely on discrete tax increment financing approaches. 
(g)  No impact on city. Unless otherwise agreed to by the city, the TIDD shall be self-supporting with regard to operations and maintenance of TIDD financed public infrastructure until the dedication of the infrastructure to the city and acceptance by the city after a one-year warranty period. Following the dedication of TIDD financed public infrastructure to the city and acceptance by the city after the one-year warranty period, operations and maintenance of TIDD financed public infrastructure shall be payable by the city from the portion of the gross receipts tax increment or property tax increment retained by the city or from other city financing sources. 
(h)  Special, limited obligations. Bonds of the TIDD shall be payable only from special funds into which are deposited and certain gross receipts tax increments and property tax increments which are dedicated for the purpose of securing TIDD bonds in accordance with the Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which may be contained herein, neither the property, the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the city shall be pledged to the payment of any TIDD obligation or indebtedness. 
(i)  TIDD financings; council approval. The TIDD board shall determine, in accordance with its policies and procedures, the amount, timing and form of financing to be used by a TIDD after review of the financial feasibility study required by section 22-6-3(g) of this article. All bond proceeds generated by the financing must be spent on project costs, including but not limited to engineering, attorneys and other professional fees, underwriting costs, and other costs relating to the construction, acquisition and renovation of public infrastructure, in accordance with the bond documents and the policies and procedures of the TIDD board. All financings shall be subject to final review and approval by the city council, provided, however, that financings which contemplate the issuance of a multiple series of bonds may be approved at the time of the approval of the first issuance of bonds and the TIDD board shall not thereafter be required to receive further approvals from city council except when there is a material change affecting the financial stability of the bond such as the amount and timing of issuance in relation to the projected build-out of the TIDD project. 
(j)  Procurement. Except as otherwise determined by the city council, the TIDD shall construct or finance improvements on such terms and with such persons as the TIDD board determines to be appropriate, in accordance with Section 5-15-12(B) of the Act, as amended. 
(k)  Costs of operation, administration and maintenance. Until the completion of the public infrastructure improvements financed by the TIDD, the expiration of the one-year warranty period for such improvements and the dedication of such improvements to the city, all costs incurred by the TIDD during such period for the administration and operation of the TIDD and the operation and maintenance of such public infrastructure improvements shall be the responsibility of the TIDD, the applicant/landowner, applicable homeowners' association, or any combination of the foregoing, as may be acceptable to the applicant/landowner, city and the TIDD.

(3)  The sources of gross receipts taxes or portions thereof to be pledged to the repayment of the gross receipts tax increment bonds; and 
(4)  Whether the bonds shall be publicly offered or privately placed. 
    If appropriate, the applicant shall enter into a "Continuing Disclosure Undertaking" (as required by Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Council) relating to the issuance of the bonds. 
(e)  Property tax increment bonds. Property tax increment bonds shall be payable from the authorized property tax increment from taxable property located within the TIDD. Applicants for property tax increment bonds shall describe in each financial feasibility study as required by section 22-6-3(g) of this article, the following: 
(1)  The amount and timing of TIDD property tax increment bonds to be issued; 
(2)  The expected market absorption of development within the TIDD; 
(3)  The sources of the property taxes or portions thereof to be pledged to the repayment of the property tax increment bonds; and 
(4)  Whether the bonds shall be publicly offered or privately placed.

(f)  Bond investor suitability. The city may require that the TIDD only have the power to sell the proposed bonds to suitable investors. If the city chooses to impose limitations on the TIDD's power to sell the proposed bonds to suitable investors and the proposed bond issue is not rated (either on its own merits or by the use of appropriate credit enhancement) in one of the three highest rating categories used by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or any other nationally recognized bond-rating agency service, then the bonds must have minimum denominations of $100,000.00 and be available for purchase and restricted with respect to resale to "Qualified Institutional Buyers" (as such term is defined in Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Council) or to "accredited investors" (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Rules Governing the Limited Offering and Sale Securities without Registration under the Securities Act of 1933). The city may choose to have investor suitability achieved through the rating requirements set forth in the preceding sentence or the establishment of large minimum denominations (e.g. not less than $100,000.00) and, if the city determines it is appropriate, covenants limiting secondary market sales of TIDD bonds through registered broker dealers. Notwithstanding the restrictions pertaining to public sales and private placements of bonds which the city may impose pursuant to this section, the restrictions may be modified or relaxed if other financing structures or features are presented which, in the sole discretion of the city council, provide other means to address investor suitability concerns. The minimum denomination requirements set forth above for TIDD bonds which are initially issued without rating shall not continue to apply if the TIDD subsequently obtains a rating in one of the three highest rating categories as provided in this section. 
(g)  Bond counsel. The TIDD board shall retain qualified bond counsel to act as bond counsel in connection with the issuance of any TIDD bonds. From time to time the city may request from bond counsel such opinions as it deems necessary in connection with the formation and activities of the TIDD. 
(Ord. No. 2008-1209, § 5, 9-23-08) 
Sec. 22-6-6. - Financial considerations. 
(a)  Debt service reserve fund. If allowed by law (including any applicable federal laws relating to the tax free status of bonds), all bond issues, except bond issues having a term of less than 30 days or bond issues that are held by the applicant/landowner or an affiliate of the applicant/landowner, shall include a debt service reserve fund in an amount acceptable to the city and the TIDD board. 
(b)  Indemnity. So long as an applicant owns 50 percent or more of the undeveloped land within the boundaries of the TIDD, the city may require the applicant (or such other third party acceptable to the city and the TIDD), to indemnify and hold harmless the city and the TIDD and their officers, agents and employees from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in any proceeding challenging the formation, operation, administration of the TIDD, the offer and sale of TIDD bonds, and the levying by the TIDD of any tax in accordance with the Act. 
    So long as the applicant owns less than 50 percent of the undeveloped land within the boundaries of the TIDD, the city may require the applicant (or such other third party acceptable to the city and the TIDD) to indemnify the city and the TIDD and their officers, agents and employees from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in any proceeding challenging the formation, operation, administration of the TIDD, the offer and sale of TIDD bonds, and the levying by the TIDD of any tax in accordance with the Act. 
    The applicant shall not be required to indemnify the city, the TIDD or their agents, officers or employees against any liability or claim relating to the continuing operation or maintenance of the public infrastructure financed by the TIDD after it is dedicated to the city and the expiration of the one-year warranty period prior to acceptance by the city during which the applicant is obligated to maintain and repair the public infrastructure. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the applicant's indemnity obligations shall not extend to claims arising from the negligence or wrongful conduct of the city, the TIDD or their respective agents, officers or employees or to claims arising from circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 
(c)  Environmental condition. Unless otherwise provided to the city pursuant to other requirements prior to TIDD financing and acquisition by the TIDD or city, the TIDD and city shall require reasonable evidence that the real property which shall be dedicated to or otherwise owned, leased or operated by the city or the TIDD is free from releases of or of the existence of any substances or materials in a quantity known by applicant/landowner to be considered hazardous or toxic and requiring remediation or removal under federal, state or local environmental laws, ordinances or regulations (collectively, "Environmental Laws") and shall require a proposed form of indemnity agreement for the benefit of the TIDD and city with respect to any liability under applicable Environmental Laws arising from the release or existence of hazardous or toxic substances on the real property as of the date that the real property is dedicated, conveyed, leased or otherwise transferred to the TIDD or city by the applicant/landowner. 
(d)  Refinancing and refunding bonds. Refinancings and refundings of bonds issued on behalf of a TIDD shall be considered utilizing the same criteria set forth in this article and in particular sections 22-6-5(d) and 22-6-5(e). Refinancings and refundings shall be expected to either (i) generate industry accepted interest rate or net present value savings; (ii) restructure payment of principal or (iii) eliminate burdensome covenants. If the refinancing or refunding is intended to address a material adverse change affecting the financial stability of the bonds or the intent of the original development agreement, the refinancings and refundings shall be submitted to the city council for approval. Any refinancing or refunding shall be subject to the final review and approval of the TIDD board. 
(e)  Cost of change. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with proposed changes to a TIDD application after preliminary approval by city council. 
(f)  Discretion and waiver. Based upon the recommendations of TIDD review staff and/or financing and legal consultants retained by the city, the city council may approve TIDD applications which do not meet the foregoing criteria, if the city council, in its discretion, determines that the particular features of the proposed TIDD, likelihood that the TIDD's projects and purposes will be successfully completed and mechanisms protecting against default on bonds, warrant that the foregoing criteria need not be applied. In making that determination, the city council may consider an opinion of an underwriter with a reputation satisfactory to the city council, that the particular features of the TIDD, the proposed projects and the bonds proposed to be issued can be successfully marketed and that the plan of finance is feasible. 
(g)  Purchaser disclosure; marketing materials. Each purchaser of real property located in the TIDD shall execute an acknowledgment of the TIDD disclosure form. The applicant shall also supply the city with a copy of the receipt. (Applicants are required to describe in their promotional material the financial and other relative impacts on the developments being induced in a TIDD. Copies of the disclosure form must be placed on file with the city.) 
(h)  Amendment. All amendments to this article shall have a prospective effect only and shall not in any way effect or otherwise modify the approval of a preexisting TIDD.

Sec. 22-8-5. - Application review. 
(a)  Review of small wireless facility applications. 
(1)  The city shall review the application for a small wireless facility permit in light of its conformity with applicable regulations of this article, and other applicable local ordinances, and shall issue a permit on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Within ten days of receiving an application for a small wireless facility, the city must determine and notify the applicant whether the application is complete. If an application is incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information in writing. Upon resubmission by the applicant, the city has ten days to notify the applicant again of an incomplete application and the shot clock will reset. Thereafter, the shot clock will be tolled only by mutual agreement between the city and the applicant, or in cases where the city determines upon a resubmission that the application is incomplete. The processing deadline is then tolled from the date the city sends the notice of incompleteness to the date the applicant provides the missing information. The application is deemed complete if the applicant is not notified within the 10-day period subject to resetting the shot clock or tolling. 
b.  Make its final decision to approve or deny the application within 60 days of receipt of an application for placement of small wireless facilities on an existing structure (subject to the resetting of the shot clock under federal law) and within 90 days of receipt of an application for the placement of small wireless facilities on a new structure (subject to the resetting of the shot clock under federal law), and subject to the tolling provisions herein; and 
c.  Advise the applicant in writing of its final decision, and in the final decision document the basis for a denial, if any, including specific code provisions on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant. In the 60 or 90 days, as applicable, after the city receives an application to collocate a small wireless facility on an existing structure or a new structure, the city may provide public notice of the application and an opportunity for written public comment on the application, submit the written public comment to the applicant and request that the applicant respond to it. If the city determines that applicable codes or laws require that a utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before an application for collocation is approved, the city may condition approval of the application on that replacement. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within 30 days of the denial without paying an additional application fee. The city shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days of receipt of the amended application. The subsequent review by the city shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the original denial. The city may require the applicant to certify that the small wireless facilities to be collocated conform with the FCC's regulations concerning radio frequency emissions. 
(2)  If the city fails to act on an application within the 60 or 90 day review period, as applicable, subject to resetting the shot clock once and tolling, the application is deemed approved. The city may also request an extension of the 60 or 90 day period, and the city and the applicant may agree to extend that period. An applicant shall not unreasonably deny a city's request to extend the period. 
(3)  The city may only deny a completed application to collocate small wireless facilities if the application does not conform with applicable codes or local laws concerning: 
a.  Public safety; 
b.  Design for utility poles to the extent that the standards are objective; 
c.  Stealth and concealment but only to the extent that the restrictions are reasonable; and 
d.  The spacing of ground-mounted equipment in a right-of-way; or 
e.  If there is non-conformance with design district or historic district requirements. 
(4)  An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities may, at the applicant's discretion, file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for multiple small wireless facilities. Provided, that the city's denial of one or more small wireless facilities in a consolidated application shall not delay the processing of any other small wireless facilities submitted in the same application. 
(5)  The city may require an applicant to obtain one or more permits to collocate a small wireless facility in a right-of-way if the requirement is of general applicability to users of the right-of-way. An applicant seeking to collocate within the city up to 25 small wireless facilities, all of which are substantially the same type, on substantially the same types of structures, may file a consolidated application for the collocation of the facilities. An applicant shall not file with the city more than one consolidated application in any five-business-day period. The applicant shall include in a consolidated application an attestation that, unless a delay in collocation is caused by the lack of commercial power or fiber at the site, the collocation will begin within 180 days after the permit issuance date. The city and provider may subsequently agree to extend that period.

Sec. 22-8-12. - General requirements for towers and poles. 
(a)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for a pole or tower exceeding the height limitation of the affected zoning district shall provide to the planning division an inventory of its existing poles or towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each pole or tower. The applicant shall only be required to provide this information in its first application following implementation of this article, and not thereafter. The planning division may share such information with other applicants applying for permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate poles or towers within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however, that the planning division is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(b)  Lighting . Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(c)  State or federal requirements . All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. 
(d)  Building codes; standards . To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes and the applicable industry standards for towers, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower at the owner's expense. 
(e)  Visual impact . All towers, poles and small wireless facilities, including equipment enclosures, shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible, consistent with the proper functioning of the structure or equipment. Such equipment enclosures shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site. Such enclosures shall also be designed to either resemble the surrounding landscape and other natural features where located in proximity to natural surroundings, or be compatible with the built environment, through matching and complimentary existing structures and specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale, color and texture or be consistent with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant zone. 
(1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings. 
(3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(f)  Use of stealth design . Concealment techniques in design districts and historic districts must be appropriate given the proposed location, design, visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and natural features. Stealth design shall be designed and constructed to substantially conform to surrounding building designs or natural settings, so as to be visually unobtrusive. 
(g)  Building-mounted equipment. 
(1)  All transmission equipment shall be concealed within existing architectural features to the maximum extent feasible. Any new architectural features proposed to conceal the transmission equipment shall be designed to mimic the existing underlying structure, shall be proportional to the existing underlying structure or conform to the underlying use and shall use materials in similar quality, finish, color and texture as the existing underlying structure. 
(2)  All roof-mounted transmission equipment shall be set back from all roof edges to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the need for "line-of-sight" transmission and reception of signals. 
(3)  Antenna arrays and supporting transmission equipment shall be installed so as to camouflage, disguise or conceal them to make them closely compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure. 
(h)  Pole-mounted or tower-mounted transmission equipment. All pole-mounted or tower-mounted transmission equipment shall be mounted as close as possible to the pole or tower so as to reduce the overall visual profile to the maximum extent feasible consistent with safety standards. 
(i)  Concealment of pole-mounted equipment. All pole-mounted equipment must be reasonably concealed to the extent technically feasible in a manner that minimizes the visual impact of the pole-mounted equipment. The concealment method and materials must receive prior written approval from the city, not to be unreasonably withheld. Antenna size limitations are exclusive of any concealment materials or fabrication. Concealment materials shall have a color and finish consistent and appropriate with the pole on which they are mounted. 
(j)  Accessory equipment . All accessory equipment located at the base of a small wireless facility shall be located or placed (at the applicant's choice) in an existing building, underground, or in an equipment shelter that is (a) designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using architecturally compatible construction and colors; and (b) be located so as to be unobtrusive as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the small wireless facility. 
(k)  Site design flexibility. Individual small wireless facility sites vary in the location of adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other local variables. By mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project could have been placed in more appropriate locations within a given site. Therefore, the small wireless facility and supporting equipment may be installed so as to best camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make them more closely compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure. 
(l)  Structural assessment . The owner of a proposed tower shall have a structural assessment of the tower conducted by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of New Mexico, which shall be submitted with the application for a permit. 
(m)  Radio frequency emissions compliance report. A radio frequency ("RF") emissions compliance report will be prepared, signed and sealed by a New Mexico-licensed professional engineer or a competent employee of the applicant, which assesses whether the proposed small wireless facility demonstrates compliance with the exposure limits established by the FCC. The employee of the applicant must be qualified in the field of RF emissions and provide satisfactory evidence of his/her qualifications to the city. 
(n)  Residential provisions. 
(1)  All small wireless facilities on residentially zoned property are encouraged to either be painted or treated the same color as the primary structure or the surface to which the facilities are attached. 
(2)  Screening or painting of roof-mounted structures is required on all sides of the residential property in which a small wireless facility is to be or is placed. 
(o)  Screening of ground-mounted equipment. Ground equipment and equipment enclosures outside of the right-of-way shall be screened by a screen wall, painted, and/or landscaped. 
(1)  Screening and equipment enclosures shall blend with or enhance the surrounding area in terms of scale, form, texture, materials, and color. Equipment shall be concealed as much as possible by blending into the natural and/or physical environment. All screening shall be at the reasonable discretion of the city. 
(2)  When trees, bushes, rocks, and other forms of landscaping are used for screening, such landscaping must match the predominant landscaping form and species within one block of the facilities. 
(p)  Additional screening requirements. Any new, modified, or replacement poles installed in the right-of-way in conjunction with the installation of a small wireless facility, including any ground mounted equipment, electrical service meter, and screening shall: 
(1)  Be designed to blend in with the surrounding streetscape with minimal visual impact; 
(2)  Satisfy all required Americans with Disabilities Act requirements; 
(3)  Not impair or interfere with line of sight visibility; and 
(4)  Not block or obstruct existing roadway or commercial signage.

(c)  The customer service administrator may furnish refuse collection service through bins or containers provided by the city to persons other than business users under appropriate agreements with the city, provided the administrator finds that such service is economically feasible and city bins and containers are available for such service. 
(d)  The customer service administrator may require individual residents or businesses to utilize a city-provided bin or container in lieu of individual residential or business service if such bin or container is not located an unreasonable distance from the individual residence or business and collection from such bin or container is reasonably required by conditions encountered in the operation of the city refuse collection and disposal system.

Failure, neglect or refusal to remove an unauthorized encroachment within 30 days after notice by the city shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable as set forth in section 1-1-10. As additional remedies, the city may remove such encroachment and collect the entire cost and expense thereof from the person responsible therefor, may compel its removal or abatement by instituting the proper proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, or shall pursue such other remedies as may be available to it at law or equity. If the permittee sought the permit in connection with land owned by him, the cost of removing any encroachment incurred by the city shall constitute a lien on such property. 
(Code 1969, § 29-56) 
Sec. 24-4-8. - Appeals. 
    If any person is aggrieved by the actions of the community development director taken pursuant to this article, the aggrieved person shall appeal the decision of the community development director to the administrative review board by advising the city clerk of his intent to do so within 30 days after the decision complained of. Upon receipt of notice of an appeal by the aggrieved person, the city clerk shall schedule a hearing before the administrative review board on the agenda of such board's next regularly scheduled meeting.

(Code 1969, § 29-62.18) 
Sec. 24-5-21. - Backfilling. 
    Unless specifically exempted in writing by the community development director, any person who trenches or excavates on or within a public place for any purpose whatsoever shall be required to backfill the trench or excavation as follows: 
(1)  In all trenches or excavations, the material used in backfilling must consist of the original excavated material or other material as required by the community development director in a finely divided form free from large lumps, large stones, rocks, pieces of old concrete or asphalt pavement, or large wet or gummy masses and must be placed compacted in layers or lifts as provided in this section from the bottom of the trench or excavation to the top of the trench or excavation. 
(2)  Each layer or lift shall be placed evenly, level and of such depth that the degree of compaction as required in this section may be obtained throughout the entire backfill without exceeding the depth of layer or lift as recommended by the manufacturer of the compaction equipment being used, for the various soil types encountered, or as determined by actual compaction tests of the lift or layer in place, or as directed by the community development director. In no event shall the method of compaction being used cause damage to a pipeline or other subsurface structure in the trench, excavation or any property adjacent thereto. 
(3)  Each lift or layer must be sufficiently moistened so that when compacted moisture content shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The backfill material when placed in a trench must be thoroughly compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of maximum density through the entire depth of the excavation or trench, with the exception that the top six inches in residential streets and the top 12 inches in arterial streets must be compacted to a maximum of 95 percent of maximum density. 
b.  Tests for compliance with this subsection shall be performed by the city or by a laboratory approved by the city. The 95 percent of maximum density requirements may be waived if the backfill or subgrade material contains 35 percent or more of material passing the no. 200 sieve, in which case the compaction must be not less than 90 percent of maximum density. 
c.  The moisture content of the backfill material in place must not exceed the optimum by more than two percent or be less than the optimum by more than five percent unless otherwise directed by the community development director. 
d.  Obtaining of the correct moisture content is the responsibility of the person doing the trench or excavation backfill. 
e.  Optimum moisture and maximum density shall be determined in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-1577, including all revisions thereof. Costs for such testing shall be paid for by the person doing the trench or excavation backfill. 
(4)  When a trench or excavation has been cut through existing pavement, the compaction for the top six inches and 12 inches as referred to in subsection (3) of this section shall mean the six inches or 12 inches of material which is placed immediately below the bottom or base of the existing pavement slab. The remainder of the backfill up to the top of the existing pavement surface is to be compacted sufficiently to provide a level and safe riding surface and shall be maintained in that condition by the person making the excavation until the permanent pavement patch can be placed, which shall in any event be done within a period of ten days. 
(5)  Backfill and compaction inspection must be made as required by the community development director. The community development director is authorized to make or to have made backfill moisture density tests for the purpose of determining compliance with the compaction requirements of this section. Such tests are to be made in accordance with the Standard Procedures of the American Standards for Testing and Materials (ASTM), including the latest revisions thereof. All costs connected with this testing shall be done at the expense of the person doing the actual backfill and compaction work. 
(6)  If the completed backfill fails to meet the density requirements of this section when tested or otherwise fails as evidenced by settlement of the trench or excavation, the community development director may order the faulty backfill material removed, replaced and recompacted to the required density specified in this section and retested at the expense of the person originally responsible for such backfill. The community development director may also order the replacement of all pavement destroyed or damaged as the result of backfill failure settlement. 
(7)  If a person responsible fails to comply with the requirements of this section, the city manager may, after notice to the responsible person and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to grant any further permit to such person to thereafter engage in trenching or excavation in any public place. The city manager shall, subject to appeal to the administrative review board, be authorized and empowered, following a hearing and the opportunity to be heard, suspend, cancel or withdraw a license or permit issued for the performance of any work which is not done in accordance with this article or to the reasonable satisfaction of the community development director. 
(Code 1969, § 29-62.19) 
Sec. 24-5-22. - Restoration of surface. 
(a)  Upon completion of the backfilling of any excavation made pursuant to this article, the permittee shall notify the community development director. Permanent resurfacing shall be done by the responsible person, if qualified, or by city forces at cost or by the city's contractor under the street maintenance contract as directed by the community development director. The community development director shall establish a minimum charge for work of less than one square yard. The cost of all resurfacing shall be borne by the responsible person. The responsible person must resurface the excavation within a period of ten days after acceptance of density tests by the city. If the city has accepted the responsibility for pavement resurfacing, the person responsible must keep each excavation safe for pedestrian and vehicle traffic for ten days after giving notice of completion of backfilling unless a longer period is required due to extreme weather conditions. In any case, the person accepting the responsibility for restoring the pavement surface remains responsible for keeping the excavation safe for pedestrian and vehicular traffic until the pavement surface has been accepted by the city.

    If a water shortage occurs in the city water system due to conditions of drought, lack of rainfall or snowpack, damage to the water system or facilities, failure of a key system component or facility, or due to civil or other emergency, the city council may implement water conservation measures based upon the stages contained within this division. The city council, upon consultation with the city manager, shall determine when each stage is to be implemented based on the operational requirements of the system and estimated water supply and demand projections. Implementation of the stages need not be sequential and the duration of each stage will be determined by the city council, upon consultation with the city manager.

(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-116. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(a)  Pretreatment facilities. A user shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in subsection 26-3-111 within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the environmental coordinator, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the environmental coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the environmental coordinator before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under this division. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. Additional pretreatment measures shall be provided as follows: 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the environmental coordinator may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division. 
(2)  Waste from commercial garbage grinders may be discharged into a public sewer where generated in the preparation of food. Such grinders must shred the waste to a degree that all particles will be carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the public sewers. Garbage grinders shall not be used for the grinding of plastic, paper products, inert materials, or garden refuse. 
(3)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the environmental coordinator, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the environmental coordinator, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired to ensure that grease, oil and sediment does not enter the public sewer system in amounts that exceed the surcharge limits in subsection 26-3-127(b). New and existing sources will be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at his expense and shall be subject to monitoring, inspection, reporting, and other pretreatment requirements by the city. 
(4)  No user shall discharge any substance directly into a manhole or other opening in a public sewer other than through an approved building sewer or control manhole unless he has been issued a temporary permit by the environmental coordinator. The environmental coordinator shall incorporate in a temporary permit such conditions as he deems reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with this division, and the user shall be required to pay applicable charges and fees therefore. 
(c)  Annual sampling. At least annually, the environmental coordinator shall sample and analyze the effluent from permitted significant industrial users and conduct surveillance activities to ensure compliance with pretreatment standards. These samplings shall be at random. 
(d)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. The environmental coordinator shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The environmental coordinator may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Or take such other action as necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the environmental coordinator may develop such a plan for any user. Significant industrial users are required to notify the environmental coordinator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the environmental coordinator of any accidental or slug discharge with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days, as required by subsection 26-3-119(f); and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(e)  Hauled wastewater; 
(1)  Septic tank waste. 
a.  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the environmental coordinator, and at such times as are established by the environmental coordinator. Such waste shall not violate sections 26-3-111 through 26-3-115 or any other requirements established by the city. The environmental coordinator shall require septic tank waste haulers to obtain a liquid waste disposal permit, with a manifest accompanying each load. 
b.  The environmental coordinator shall require a sample aliquot from each septage load to be delivered to the POTW. The sample shall be collected by the individual requesting a liquid waste disposal permit. Each sample collected must be representative of the septage waste being unloaded at the POTW receiving station. Listed below is the required information that must be provided on the label of each sample container. 
1.  Name of company. 
2.  Date and time collected. 
3.  Name and address of source. 
4.  Collected by. 
5.  Liquid waste disposal permit number. 
The sample gathered shall be stored in the provided refrigerator located at the septage receiving station. 
c.  The environmental coordinator shall require random testing to analyze for compliance of sections 26-3-111 through 26-3-115 of this division. 
(2)  The environmental coordinator shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The environmental coordinator also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this division. 
(3)  The environmental coordinator shall require analyses of each hauled load of industrial waste to ensure compliance with applicable standards in sections 26-3-111 through 26-3-115. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the environmental coordinator. Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the environmental coordinator. 
(4)  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(5)  Any hauled waste found to be noncompliant with applicable standards the environmental coordinator may refuse the company which was noncompliant, from any further requests for further disposal. Also, the environmental coordinator may apply enforcement remedies found in sections 26-3-123 through 26-3-126.

Sec. 26-3-117. - Wastewater discharge permit. 
(a)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the environmental coordinator, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 60 days of the request. The environmental coordinator is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(b)  Required. A wastewater discharge permit shall be required as follows: 
(1)  No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the environmental coordinator, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. 
(2)  The environmental coordinator may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this division. 
(3)  Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in sections 26-3-123 through 26-3-125. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law. 
(c)  Existing connections. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW before the effective date of the ordinance and who wishes to continue such discharges shall apply to the environmental coordinator for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the environmental coordinator. 
(d)  New connections. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, must be filed at least 90 days before the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. 
(e)  Application contents. All users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application. The environmental coordinator may require all users to submit as part of an application the following information: 
(1)  All information required by subsection 26-3-119(a)(2);

 The environmental coordinator may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
 The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
6.  Any other information as may be deemed necessary by environmental coordinator to evaluate the permit application. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O & M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O & M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule By which the user will provide such additional pretreatment or O & M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b) of this section. 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 26-3-117(f). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)g. of this section: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards; such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation; 
(2)  No increment referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the environmental coordinator no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the environmental coordinator. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or for a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the environmental coordinator a report containing the information described in subsections (a)(2)d., (2)e., and (2)f. of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production or other measure of operation, this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 26-3-117(f). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at least twice a year as stated in the permit, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the environmental coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 26-3-117(f). 
Monitoring frequency. The city requires a minimum reporting frequency of twice a year for all categorical and significant IUs. Each permitted user that discharges to the POTW during the corresponding reporting period shall sample and report the results to the industrial pretreatment program (IPP) coordinator. The self-monitoring report shall be submitted by the dates specified below: 
Reporting Period Report Due January 1-June 30 30 days later, 
July 30 July 1-December 31 15 days later, 
January 15  
If a user is issued a discharge permit during the reporting period the self-monitoring requirements still need to be met. 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the environmental coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be reported to the environmental coordinator within 30 days of the monitoring and shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the environmental coordinator of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ten days before the change. 
(1)  The environmental coordinator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 26-3-117(e). 
(2)  The environmental coordinator may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection 26-3-117(g) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 26-3-117(d) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this subsection significant changes include but are not limited to flow increases of ten percent or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  If any discharge occurs, including but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug discharge or slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the environmental coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the environmental coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrence. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a discharge occurs as described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the environmental coordinator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the environmental coordinator as the environmental coordinator may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the environmental coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the environmental coordinator within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the environmental coordinator monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the environmental coordinator samples between the users's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Notification of discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections (a), (b) and (d) of this section. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  For any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the environmental coordinator, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  If any notification is made under this subsection, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This subsection does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division or a permit issued under this division or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (k)(2) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by [the] environmental coordinator. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by [the city], as appropriate. 
In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data is available, the environmental coordinator may authorize a lower minimum. For periodic compliance reports, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, including documentation with best management practices. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling; the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the environmental coordinator. 
(n)  Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with application subsection 26-3-117(f); users submitting baseline monitoring reports under BMR section 26-3-119(6)(h); users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under section 26-3-119(6)(c) and users submitting periodic compliance reports required by subsection 26-3-119(d)(1). The certification statement found at [subsection] 26-3-117(f) must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in section 26-3-106. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-120. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry for inspection and sampling. The environmental coordinator shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this division and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division. Users shall allow the environmental coordinator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the environmental coordinator will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The environmental coordinator shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The environmental coordinator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum of every 30 days to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the environmental coordinator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the environmental coordinator access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the environmental coordinator has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued under this division or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the environmental coordinator may seek issuance of a search warrant from the municipal court of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-121. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the environmental coordinator's inspection and sampling activities under this division, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the environmental coordinator, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined by 40 CFR 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-122. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The environmental coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates paragraphs (3), (4) or (8) of this section) and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the wastewater measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in section 26-3-106. 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including an instantaneous limits, as defined in sections 26-3-111 through 26-3-115, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 26-3-106 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the environmental coordinator determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the environmental coordinator's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation, which may include a violation of best management practices, which the environmental coordinator determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-123. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the environmental coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the environmental coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the environmental coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Conciliation. The environmental coordinator may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The environmental coordinator may order a user who has violated, or continues to violate, any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the environmental coordinator and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the environmental coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the environmental coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the environmental coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Emergency suspensions. The environmental coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The environmental coordinator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or that presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the environmental coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The environmental coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the environmental coordinator that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (g) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the environmental coordinator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) and (g) of this section. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(g)  Termination of discharge. In addition to subsection 26-3-118(e), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 26-3-112. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the environmental coordinator shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-124. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the environmental coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental coordinator may petition the district court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The environmental coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Damages and enforcement costs. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum fine of $1,000.00 per violation, per day, as provided in subsection 1-1-10(e) of this Code. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The environmental coordinator may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for 90 days or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 per violation per day or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both. 
(4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The environmental coordinator may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the environmental coordinator may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the environmental coordinator is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-125. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Performance bonds. The environmental coordinator may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any section of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the environmental coordinator to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(b)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(c)  Public nuisances. A violation of any section of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the environmental coordinator. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to section 18-5-11 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying the nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1260, § 1, 11-13-12) 
Sec. 26-3-126. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. Under this division, the affirmative defense of upset shall apply as follows: 
(1)  For the purposes of this subsection, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the environmental coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  A user will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  A user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 26-3-111(a) or the specific prohibitions in subsection 26-3-111(b) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection, shall have the following meanings, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the environmental coordinator, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
a.  A user shall submit oral notice to the environmental coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The environmental coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the environmental coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
d.  The environmental coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the environmental coordinator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a. of this section.

    2.1.2 Zoning district hierarchy. Under the hierarchy of zoning districts established by this Unified Development Code, the RE-2 district is the most restrictive zoning district and the IND district is the least restrictive zoning district. The PUD district and the overlay districts are not included in the zoning district hierarchy. 
Commentary: Zoning district changes made in this Unified Development Code, in addition to name changes, relative to the previous City of Farmington Zoning Ordinance include the following:  C-4, Planned shopping center district is replaced with a generic PD, planned development district, a special purpose district that allows site specific variation of use, and density and dimensional standards.  The M-1, light industrial district and the M-2, general industrial district are combined to form the IND, industrial district.  The new LNC, local neighborhood commercial district will provide neighborhood retail and services compatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhoods served.  
    2.1.3 Establishment of special purpose and overlay zoning districts. The following special purpose and overlay zoning districts are hereby established: 
SYMBOL DISTRICT NAME FORMER NAME ANO Airport noise overlay New SMHAO Special mobile home area overlay Special mobile home area RPO Residential preservation overlay New PUD Planned unit development New PD Planned development New  
Commentary: Special purpose districts (including both special purpose and overlay districts) changes made in this Unified Development Code relative to the previous City of Farmington Zoning Ordinance include the following:  The new ANO, airport noise overlay district is designed to ensure compatible land use relationships with surrounding land uses and to comply with FAA recommendations.  The new RPO, residential protection overlay district is intended for application to the Civic Center neighborhood and designed to encourage the adaptive reuse of the neighborhood while preserving its historic residential character.  The new PUD, planned unit development district is an overlay districe designed to provide added flexibility with respect to the dimensional standards of the code, provided that overall density of the underlying district is not exceeded.  The new PD, planned development district is a special purpose district in which allowed uses, density and dimensional standards and site plan are to be determined at the time of zoning approval in the best interests of the city and compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and land uses. Developers have broad discretion to propose what they think best fits on a given site and show how it works relative to surrounding uses.  
Sec. 2.2   Zoning map.
    The boundaries of the zoning districts established by this UDC are shown on the "Official Zoning Map of City of Farmington, New Mexico" which is a part of this UDC as fully as if it were set out in this UDC in detail. Original zoning district maps are maintained in the office of the community development director. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
    2.2.1 Omitted land. It is the intent of this UDC that every part of the incorporated City of Farmington be included in one of the zoning districts established by this UDC. Any land located now or in the future in the city not shown to be included in a zoning district shall be deemed to be classified in the RE-2 district, pending approval of a zoning map amendment pursuant to the requirements of section 8.7. 
    2.2.2 Additional land areas. Any land area that comes under the jurisdiction of this UDC shall automatically be classified in accordance with state statutes. 
    2.2.3 Multiple zoning districts. Whenever a lot of record is divided by a zoning boundary, the development of the lot shall conform to the land use and design criteria of the zoning district in place on that specific portion of the lot. 
Commentary: Multiple zoning on a single parcel should be avoided. Where the opportunity arises to correct multiple zoning, such parcels should be rezoned to a single district.  
    2.2.4 District boundaries. The following rules govern interpretations regarding the location of zoning district boundaries. 
A.  Municipal boundaries. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the limits of any incorporated municipality shall be construed as following those limits. 
B.  Streets and highways. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets and/or highways shall be construed to follow the centerlines of those streets and/or highways. 
C.  Property lines. Boundary lines shown as following or approximately following platted lot lines or other property lines shall be construed as following those lines. 
D.  Section lines. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following section lines, half-section lines, or quarter-section lines shall be construed as following those lines. 
E.  Railroads. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of those railroad lines. 
F.  Watercourses. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing watercourses shall be construed as following the channel centerline of those watercourses taken at mean low water, and, in the event of a natural change in the location of those streams, rivers, or other watercourses, the zone boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. 
G.  Map scale and distances. Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any of the features listed in this subsection shall be construed to be parallel to those features and at such distances as are shown on the zoning district map. Distances not specifically indicated on the map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
Sec. 2.3   Use table.
    All allowable principal uses, as specified in the table below (Table 2.3), shall be established in permanent structures, except as may be otherwise expressly permitted or inherent to the character of such allowed uses. All of the use categories used in the table are explained in section 2.7. The first column contains use categories and the second column contains a list of specific uses, which provide an abbreviated explanation of the respective use category. If there is a conflict between the abbreviated specific use and the full explanation in section 2.7, the provisions of section 2.7 shall control. The final column of the table contains references to "Use Standards" that apply to the listed use type in all zoning districts and circumstances. The use standards applicable to the respective specific uses are presented in alphabetical order in section 2.4 following the use table. 
    2.3.1 Accessory uses. The regulations that apply to accessory uses are contained in section 2.5. 
    2.3.2 Temporary uses. Temporary uses may be allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the temporary use review procedures. The regulations that apply to temporary uses are contained in section 2.6. Temporary uses are subject to all other applicable provisions of this UDC. 
    2.3.3 Uses not allowed. A blank cell (one without a "P", or "S") indicates that a use type is not allowed in the respective zoning district. Uses not listed may be allowed in accordance with the similar use interpretation provisions of section 2.7.2. 
    2.3.4 Principal uses. 
P Permitted uses: 
A "P" indicates that a use is allowed by right in the respective zoning district and may be reviewed and approved by the director, without public review. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC. 
S Special uses: 
An "S" indicates that a use is allowed only if reviewed and approved as a special use, in accordance with the special use review procedures of section 8.9. Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC. 
Commentary: The use table is organized into five major groups:  Residential use categories  Public, civic and institutional use categories  Retail, service and commercial use categories  Industrial use categories  Other use categories Each major use group is further divided into specific uses. The use category system is based on common functional, product or compatibility characteristics, thereby regulating uses in accordance with criteria directly relevant to the public interest.

Sec. 2.4   Use standards.
    Specific uses listed below may be allowed in accordance with the Use Table in section 2.3 and subject to the following standards: 
    2.4.1 Adult bookstores and entertainment. (Retail, service and commercial use categories; retail sales and service, entertainment-oriented). 
    Adult bookstores and entertainments establishments shall comply with the standards of this section. 
A.  Use limitations. Such uses may include the following uses as defined in Article 11, Definitions: adult bookstore, adult movie theater, adult lounge, parlor or cabaret, adult novelties, adult entertainment, and adult video. Adult modeling studios and any other type of sexual encounter center shall be prohibited. 
B.  Minimum separation distance: One thousand feet. 
The above separation distance applies to all adult entertainment establishments, and to specific uses including, other adult entertainment establishments, any residential property, religious assembly, library, cultural service, childcare center, elementary or secondary school, community centers, or public park. 
(1)  Exception. City Council may approve a lesser separation than required above with the following findings: 
a.  The location of the proposed sexual adult oriented business will not have a detrimental effect on nearby properties nor be contrary to the public safety or welfare; 
b.  That the granting of the exception will not violate the spirit and intent of this section; 
c.  That the location of the proposed sexually oriented business will not downgrade the property values or quality of life in the adjacent areas or encourage the development of urban blight; 
d.  That the location of the adult oriented business in the area will not be contrary to any existing program of neighborhood conservation nor interfere with any efforts of urban renewal or restoration; 
e.  That adequate buffering exists to protect neighboring zones; and 
f.  That all other applicable provisions of this section will be observed. 
C.  Measurement. For the purposes of this section, distances shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest point on the property line of the lot on which the adult entertainment establishment is located, to the nearest point on any property line of a residential property, specific use, or other adult entertainment establishment is located. 
D.  Signs. Signs advertising an adult entertainment establishment, as defined in Article 11, definitions, shall comply with the standards of section 5.8, signs, and with those of this section. Such signs: 
(1)  Shall not contain any flashing lights or moving parts; 
(2)  Shall contain no photographs, silhouettes, drawings or pictorial representations of any manner, and shall not advertise either graphically or verbally, either by explicit or literal expression, any specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas; and 
(3)  May only contain the name of the enterprise and/or one or more of the following phrases: adult bookstore, adult movie theater, adult lounge, parlor or cabaret, adult novelties, adult entertainment, and adult video. 
E.  Prohibited activities. An adult entertainment use shall not be conducted in any manner that provides the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas" defined in Article 11, definitions, from any public right-of-way. This provision shall apply to any display, decoration or show window. 
F.  Limited exception for subsequent specific uses and residential property. An adult entertainment establishment, lawfully operating under this UDC, shall not be deemed to be in violation of the location restrictions set forth in this subsection solely because a specific use subsequently locates within the minimum required distance of the adult entertainment establishment, or when any other lot or tract within the required minimum distance of the adult entertainment establishment, subsequently becomes residential property. 
G.  Licensing of the owner/manager. The city council shall determine that the owner/manager of the establishment qualifies for a licensee pursuant to the criteria set forth in section 8-14-4, Farmington Municipal Code. 
H.  Specific prohibitions. 
(1)  Private viewing areas. It shall be a violation of the Farmington City Code to operate an adult arcade or adult entertainment center as a part of any adult oriented establishment unless the building is internally constructed so that the viewing areas in such arcades or establishments are visible from a continuous main aisle and are not obscured by any curtain, wall, door, or other enclosure. 
(2)  Underage employees and nude modeling studios. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to employ, in any capacity, at a nude modeling studio, any person under the age of 18 years. Further, no sofa, bed, mattress, chair, or mat may be utilized in any such studio. Provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the presence of a couch or chairs in a public reception area or in any office area. 
I.  Other requirements. The city council may establish additional, appropriate conditions as it deems necessary, on a case-by-case basis, including but not limited to: 
(1)  Screening from adjacent uses in accordance with the requirements of section 5.5.7, screening standards; 
(2)  The parking lot be visible from any street; and 
(3)  Additional exterior lighting and/or landscaping. 
J.  Timing requirements for review. 
(1)  The planning and zoning commission shall forward its recommendation on applications for adult-oriented businesses to the city council for final action no later than 60 days from receipt of a completed application. If the commission has failed to take any action within 60 days from the date of its receipt of a completed application, the application shall be referred to the city council for final action without recommendation. 
(2)  The city council shall act on such applications within 30 days following receipt by the city council of the commission recommendation. 
(3)  Final action on such applications shall occur within 90 days of the receipt of a properly completed adult-oriented business application. Failure of the city council to either grant or deny such applications within a 90-day time period shall be deemed to constitute approval of the adult oriented business application. 
(4)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the applicant from agreeing to an extension of any time periods. Applicant requests for extensions of time, tabling, or postponement by either the commission or the city council shall extend the time for final action by the period of time the applicant has requested a postponement. 
(5)  As used herein, final action shall mean the action of the city council taken in open session granting or denying an application for an adult oriented business. The fact that the city council may require additional time to prepare written findings and conclusions shall not operate to extend the time for final action nor shall it be deemed a failure to act within the mandatory period for action.

    Agriculture shall comply with the standards of this section. 
A.  Agriculture shall be limited to field crops, truck gardening, berry or bush crops, tree crops, nurseries, aviaries and apiaries, including greenhouses; but shall not include salesrooms, farmers markets, or roadside stands.

Sec. 2.7   Use categories.
    2.7.1 General. Use categories shall be defined or otherwise interpreted in accordance with the following: 
A.  Basis for classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
C.  Developments with multiple principal uses. 
(1)  When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and service category, entertainment-oriented because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. 
(2)  When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. In a development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and gas station, for example, the coffee shop and bookstore would be classified in the retail sales and service, entertainment-oriented category, however, the service station would be classified in the retail sales and service, vehicle services limited. 
D.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. In addition, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
E.  Use of examples. The "examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale warehouse" but which sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category. 
    2.7.2 Similar use interpretations. The standards of this section shall guide officials in making similar use interpretations. 
Commentary: Similar use interpretations, like all administrative decisions, may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of section 8.15, appeals of administrative decisions.  
A.  Authority. If an application is submitted for a use type not listed in the use table, section 2.3, the director shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation, based on the following considerations: 
(1)  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type; 
(2)  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
(3)  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
(4)  The customer type for each activity; 
(5)  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
(6)  Hours of operation; 
(7)  Building and site arrangement; 
(8)  Vehicles used with the activity; 
(9)  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; 
(10)  Signs; 
(11)  How the use advertises itself; and 
(12)  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
B.  Use interpretation standards.

(Ord. No. 2011-1251, § 2, 10-25-11) 
    2.8.3 Measurements and exceptions. 
A.  Lot area. 
(1)  Measurements. The area of a lot shall include the total horizontal surface area within the lot's boundaries, excluding public rights-of-way. 
(2)  Lots within multiple zoning districts. If a lot falls within multiple zoning districts, the minimum lot area requirements for the most restrictive district shall be met. 
(3)  Flag or panhandle lots. The flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot shall not be included in calculating minimum lot size. 
(4)  Exceptions. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements of this UDC, except in the following cases: 
a.  Nonconforming lots may be used in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 9.4.1, authority to utilize for single-family residence. 
b.  Utilities using land or an unoccupied building covering less than 1,000 square feet of site area shall be exempt from minimum lot area standards. 
c.  Minimum lot area requirements shall not apply to dormitories, fraternities, or sororities where no cooking facilities are provided in individual rooms or apartments. 
B.  Lot width. 
(1)  Measurements. Lot width shall be measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the street lot line or its chord. Measurements of lot width shall be made at the required front setback line. When a lot has more than one front setback line, lot width shall be measured along the front setback line with the narrower width. In all cases, the width between side lot lines at their intersection with street lot lines shall be at least 25 feet. 
(2)  Flag lots. The flag pole or panhandle portion of a flag lot shall be subject to the lot width requirements for non-flag lots. 
C.  Required yards (setbacks). 
(1)  Measurements. Required yards refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost wall or wall edge of an allowed structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located. Such yards shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this section. 
(2)  Front and street yards. Front and street yards shall extend the full width of a lot, the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the street lot line and a line parallel thereto on the site. 

Commentary: Required front yards include land or lot areas located between the road right-of-way and the required front setback line. (See also section 2.8.1, residential base zoning district density and dimensional schedule, for setback requirements).  
a.  Corner lots. 
(1)  On back-to-back corner lots a 15-foot street side yard is allowed. However, a fence or wall may be constructed on the property line, provided no driveway access (except RV parking) exists on the street side yard of the subject property or on the property to the rear. If driveway access exists on the subject property or on the lot to the rear, all structures, including fence or wall, must respect the 15-foot street side yard setback and intersection visibility as set forth in section 5.3.6. 
(2)  Where a corner lot abuts an interior side yard of the property to the rear, there shall be a front yard setback on both streets with the street side yard being equal to the front yard of the lot to the rear, but in no case less than 15 feet. 
b.  Double-frontage lots (through lots). In rare case where double frontage (through) lots are approved, a front setback shall be maintained from both streets. 
c.  Flag lots. For flag lots, the flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot shall not be considered part of the front yard, rather the lot line that is closest to and most closely parallel to the access street shall be considered the front lot line. 
d.  Exceptions. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the front and street yard requirements of this UDC, except in the following cases: 
(1)  Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, the depth of a front or side yard setback shall be measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building. 
(2)  Uncovered porches and decks may encroach into the required front yard for a distance of not more than six feet. 
(3)  Filling station pumps and pump islands may encroach into required yards, provided that they are not less than 15 feet from the street lines. 
(4)  All garages and carports shall maintain a minimum 20-foot front yard setback; provided, however, carports in subdivisions approved prior to the adoption of Ordinance Number 444 on April 9, 1969, shall maintain a minimum ten-foot front yard setback. Such uses shall comply with the requirements of section 5.3.6, corner setbacks and intersection visibility (safe sight triangle). 
(5)  Signs, which are in conformance with the requirements of section 5.8, signs, and section 5.3.6, corner setback and intersection visibility (safe sight triangle), may encroach into required front yards. 
(3)  Side yards. Side yards shall extend from the required front setback line to the required rear setback line and be measured from the side lot line. Side setbacks on double-frontage lots shall run the full length between street lot lines. However, the following exceptions shall apply: 
a.  In the SF-10 and SF-7 districts, interior side yards for one-story portions of residences may be reduced to five feet for structures built to HUD standards, UBC standards, IBC and/or IRC standards. 
b.  Development with no side yard setbacks is allowed only for attached townhouses and attached single-family. 
c.  Residential accessory structures that are separated at least ten feet from the principal structure may be constructed in a rear yard; provided, that such accessory structure; does not occupy more than 30 percent of the area of the required rear yard, is not greater than 12 feet in height, and the distance from any part of such structure to a side lot line is at least three feet, except that accessory buildings or structures of 120 square feet or less may extend to the rear and/or side lot line, provided such structures are not greater than ten feet in height, and no portion of the structure crosses into or drains onto adjacent property. 
d.  Mobile homes are subject to the more restrictive standards of section 2.4.32. 
e.  Signs, which are in conformance with the requirements of section 5.8, signs, and section 5.3.6, corner setback and intersection visibility, may encroach into required side yards. 
(4)  Rear yards. Rear yards shall extend the full width of the lot and be measured from the rear lot line. If a corner lot has more than four sides, the yards along the interior lot lines that do not intersect a street line shall be considered rear yards. However, the following exceptions shall apply: 
a.  Whenever a lot abuts to a public alley, one-half of the alley width may be considered part of the rear yard. 
b.  Uncovered porches and decks may encroach into the required rear yard for a distance of not more than 50 percent of the required setback. 
c.  Residential accessory structures that are separated at least ten feet from the principal structure may be constructed in a rear yard; provided, that such accessory structures: 
(1)  Do not occupy more than 30 percent of the area of the required rear yard; 
(2)  Are not greater than 12 feet in height; and 
(3)  The distance from any part of such structure to a rear lot line is at least five feet, and the distance from any part of such structure to a side lot line is at least three feet. 
d.  Except, that accessory buildings or structures of 120 square feet or less may extend to the rear and/or side lot line, provided such structures are not greater than ten feet in height, and no portion of the structure crosses into or drains onto adjacent property. 
(5)  Projections/encroachments, general. The following features may project in required setbacks to the extent indicated. 
a.  Trees, shrubs, flowers, hedges, and other landscape features, provided that no fence, wall, hedge, shrubbery, etc. are not higher than a baseline extending from a point two and one-half feet above walk grade to a point four and one-half feet above walk grade at the depth of the required front yard. Single trees having single trunks that are pruned to a height of seven feet above walk grade are the exception; 
b.  Fences and walls; 
c.  Sidewalks and driveways; 
d.  Architectural features, such as, but not limited to, cornices, chimneys, eaves, stoops and gutters, and ordinary projections of window air conditioners may project up to two feet into the required yards; 
e.  Structural or mechanical devices added to structures to make such structures accessible to physically disadvantaged persons may encroach into required setbacks and buffers; 
f.  Mechanical equipment such as air conditioning units, pool pumps and similar equipment may be located in any required yard; 
g.  Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles; and 
h.  Accessory, open and uncovered swimming pools and home barbecue grills may occupy a required rear yard, provided they are not located closer than five feet to the rear lot line and not closer than three feet to a side lot line. 

(6)  Setback averaging. Where the average of the front setbacks for all lots located within 200 feet of either side of a lot (same side of street) is less than the minimum required front setback, the required setback line may be reduced to this lesser average depth, but in no case, to less than ten feet. For the purpose of computing such average, a vacant lot shall be considered to have the minimum front setback required for the zoning district. 

D.  Height. 
(1)  Measurement. 
a.  Height of buildings shall be measured as the vertical distance in feet between the lowest point where the wall face of the building intersects finished grade along the front of a building to the highest point of the building, i.e.: 
(1)  Top of the highest roof beam on a flat or shed roof; 
(2)  Deck level on a mansard roof; or 
(3)  Average distance between the eaves and apex of a gable, hip, or gambrel roof. 

b.  Height of fences or walls shall be measured as the vertical distance between finished grade on the highest side of the fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall. 
(2)  Exceptions to maximum building height. 
a.  Towers, spires, cupolas, chimneys, elevator penthouses, water tanks, flagpoles, monuments, theater scenery lofts, radio and television antennas, and similar structures and necessary mechanical appurtenances covering not more than 25 percent of the roof area of the structure may exceed the maximum permitted height in the district in which the site is located. Such exceptions shall be subject to the following regulation: Ten feet with no discretionary review. A special use permit shall be required for features extending more than ten feet above the base district height limit. 
b.  Public, semipublic or public service buildings, hospitals, institutions, or schools, when permitted in a district, may be erected to a height not exceeding 60 feet, and churches and temples may be erected to a height not exceeding 75 feet, when the required side and rear yards are each increased by at least one-foot for each one foot of additional building height above the height regulations for the district in which the building is located. 
c.  Residential accessory structures located within required rear yards shall not be greater than 15 feet in height. 
    2.8.4 Building coverage. The portion of a site covered by principal and accessory buildings and structures, as measured from the outside of the building or structure at ground level, and expressed as a percentage of total site area. 

    A. Exception. Building coverage may be increased by up to 50 percent when all required parking is provided underground. 
Sec. 2.2 - Zoning map. 
    The boundaries of the zoning districts established by this UDC are shown on the "Official Zoning Map of City of Farmington, New Mexico" which is a part of this UDC as fully as if it were set out in this UDC in detail. Original zoning district maps are maintained in the office of the community development director. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
    2.2.1 Omitted land. It is the intent of this UDC that every part of the incorporated City of Farmington be included in one of the zoning districts established by this UDC. Any land located now or in the future in the city not shown to be included in a zoning district shall be deemed to be classified in the RE-2 district, pending approval of a zoning map amendment pursuant to the requirements of section 8.7. 
    2.2.2 Additional land areas. Any land area that comes under the jurisdiction of this UDC shall automatically be classified in accordance with state statutes. 
    2.2.3 Multiple zoning districts. Whenever a lot of record is divided by a zoning boundary, the development of the lot shall conform to the land use and design criteria of the zoning district in place on that specific portion of the lot. 
Commentary: Multiple zoning on a single parcel should be avoided. Where the opportunity arises to correct multiple zoning, such parcels should be rezoned to a single district.  
    2.2.4 District boundaries. The following rules govern interpretations regarding the location of zoning district boundaries. 
A.  Municipal boundaries. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the limits of any incorporated municipality shall be construed as following those limits. 
B.  Streets and highways. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets and/or highways shall be construed to follow the centerlines of those streets and/or highways. 
C.  Property lines. Boundary lines shown as following or approximately following platted lot lines or other property lines shall be construed as following those lines. 
D.  Section lines. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following section lines, half-section lines, or quarter-section lines shall be construed as following those lines. 
E.  Railroads. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of those railroad lines. 
F.  Watercourses. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing watercourses shall be construed as following the channel centerline of those watercourses taken at mean low water, and, in the event of a natural change in the location of those streams, rivers, or other watercourses, the zone boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. 
G.  Map scale and distances. Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any of the features listed in this subsection shall be construed to be parallel to those features and at such distances as are shown on the zoning district map. Distances not specifically indicated on the map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
Sec. 2.3   Use table.
    All allowable principal uses, as specified in the table below (Table 2.3), shall be established in permanent structures, except as may be otherwise expressly permitted or inherent to the character of such allowed uses. All of the use categories used in the table are explained in section 2.7. The first column contains use categories and the second column contains a list of specific uses, which provide an abbreviated explanation of the respective use category. If there is a conflict between the abbreviated specific use and the full explanation in section 2.7, the provisions of section 2.7 shall control. The final column of the table contains references to "Use Standards" that apply to the listed use type in all zoning districts and circumstances. The use standards applicable to the respective specific uses are presented in alphabetical order in section 2.4 following the use table. 
    2.3.1 Accessory uses. The regulations that apply to accessory uses are contained in section 2.5. 
    2.3.2 Temporary uses. Temporary uses may be allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the temporary use review procedures. The regulations that apply to temporary uses are contained in section 2.6. Temporary uses are subject to all other applicable provisions of this UDC. 
    2.3.3 Uses not allowed. A blank cell (one without a "P", or "S") indicates that a use type is not allowed in the respective zoning district. Uses not listed may be allowed in accordance with the similar use interpretation provisions of section 2.7.2. 
    2.3.4 Principal uses. 
P Permitted uses: 
A "P" indicates that a use is allowed by right in the respective zoning district and may be reviewed and approved by the director, without public review. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC. 
S Special uses: 
An "S" indicates that a use is allowed only if reviewed and approved as a special use, in accordance with the special use review procedures of section 8.9. Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC. 
Commentary: The use table is organized into five major groups:  Residential use categories  Public, civic and institutional use categories  Retail, service and commercial use categories  Industrial use categories  Other use categories Each major use group is further divided into specific uses. The use category system is based on common functional, product or compatibility characteristics, thereby regulating uses in accordance with criteria directly relevant to the public interest. For a more detailed explanation of the use category system, see section 2.7.1.

(1)  Exception. City Council may approve a lesser separation than required above with the following findings: 
a.  The location of the proposed sexual adult oriented business will not have a detrimental effect on nearby properties nor be contrary to the public safety or welfare; 
b.  That the granting of the exception will not violate the spirit and intent of this section; 
c.  That the location of the proposed sexually oriented business will not downgrade the property values or quality of life in the adjacent areas or encourage the development of urban blight; 
d.  That the location of the adult oriented business in the area will not be contrary to any existing program of neighborhood conservation nor interfere with any efforts of urban renewal or restoration; 
e.  That adequate buffering exists to protect neighboring zones; and 
f.  That all other applicable provisions of this section will be observed. 
C.  Measurement. For the purposes of this section, distances shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest point on the property line of the lot on which the adult entertainment establishment is located, to the nearest point on any property line of a residential property, specific use, or other adult entertainment establishment is located. 
D.  Signs. Signs advertising an adult entertainment establishment, as defined in Article 11, definitions, shall comply with the standards of section 5.8, signs, and with those of this section. Such signs: 
(1)  Shall not contain any flashing lights or moving parts;

(3)  May only contain the name of the enterprise and/or one or more of the following phrases: adult bookstore, adult movie theater, adult lounge, parlor or cabaret, adult novelties, adult entertainment, and adult video. 
E.  Prohibited activities. An adult entertainment use shall not be conducted in any manner that provides the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas" defined in Article 11, definitions, from any public right-of-way. This provision shall apply to any display, decoration or show window. 
F.  Limited exception for subsequent specific uses and residential property. An adult entertainment establishment, lawfully operating under this UDC, shall not be deemed to be in violation of the location restrictions set forth in this subsection solely because a specific use subsequently locates within the minimum required distance of the adult entertainment establishment, or when any other lot or tract within the required minimum distance of the adult entertainment establishment, subsequently becomes residential property. 
G.  Licensing of the owner/manager. The city council shall determine that the owner/manager of the establishment qualifies for a licensee pursuant to the criteria set forth in section 8-14-4, Farmington Municipal Code. 
H.  Specific prohibitions. 
(1)  Private viewing areas. It shall be a violation of the Farmington City Code to operate an adult arcade or adult entertainment center as a part of any adult oriented establishment unless the building is internally constructed so that the viewing areas in such arcades or establishments are visible from a continuous main aisle and are not obscured by any curtain, wall, door, or other enclosure. 
(2)  Underage employees and nude modeling studios. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to employ, in any capacity, at a nude modeling studio, any person under the age of 18 years. Further, no sofa, bed, mattress, chair, or mat may be utilized in any such studio. Provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the presence of a couch or chairs in a public reception area or in any office area.

(2)  The city council shall act on such applications within 30 days following receipt by the city council of the commission recommendation. 
(3)  Final action on such applications shall occur within 90 days of the receipt of a properly completed adult-oriented business application. Failure of the city council to either grant or deny such applications within a 90-day time period shall be deemed to constitute approval of the adult oriented business application. 
(4)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the applicant from agreeing to an extension of any time periods. Applicant requests for extensions of time, tabling, or postponement by either the commission or the city council shall extend the time for final action by the period of time the applicant has requested a postponement. 
(5)  As used herein, final action shall mean the action of the city council taken in open session granting or denying an application for an adult oriented business.

Sec. 2.7   Use categories.
    2.7.1 General. Use categories shall be defined or otherwise interpreted in accordance with the following: 
A.  Basis for classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
C.  Developments with multiple principal uses. 
(1)  When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and service category, entertainment-oriented because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. 
(2)  When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. In a development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and gas station, for example, the coffee shop and bookstore would be classified in the retail sales and service, entertainment-oriented category, however, the service station would be classified in the retail sales and service, vehicle services limited. 
D.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. In addition, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
E.  Use of examples. The "examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale warehouse" but which sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category. 
    2.7.2 Similar use interpretations. The standards of this section shall guide officials in making similar use interpretations. 
Commentary: Similar use interpretations, like all administrative decisions, may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of section 8.15, appeals of administrative decisions.  
A.  Authority. If an application is submitted for a use type not listed in the use table, section 2.3, the director shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation, based on the following considerations: 
(1)  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type; 
(2)  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
(3)  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
(4)  The customer type for each activity; 
(5)  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
(6)  Hours of operation; 
(7)  Building and site arrangement; 
(8)  Vehicles used with the activity; 
(9)  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; 
(10)  Signs; 
(11)  How the use advertises itself; and 
(12)  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
B.  Use interpretation standards. 
(1)  No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning district when that use is a permitted or a special use in any other zoning district. 
(2)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and standards of this UDC. 
(3)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning district unless the use is more similar to such uses than to permitted and special uses allowed in other zoning districts. 
(4)  If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a special use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a special use permit, as appropriate. 
C.  Effect of similar use interpretation. No similar use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Farmington or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to special use permits, development permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.

(1)  Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, the depth of a front or side yard setback shall be measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building. 
(2)  Uncovered porches and decks may encroach into the required front yard for a distance of not more than six feet. 
(3)  Filling station pumps and pump islands may encroach into required yards, provided that they are not less than 15 feet from the street lines. 
(4)  All garages and carports shall maintain a minimum 20-foot front yard setback; provided, however, carports in subdivisions approved prior to the adoption of Ordinance Number 444 on April 9, 1969, shall maintain a minimum ten-foot front yard setback.

(5)  Signs, which are in conformance with the requirements of section 5.8, signs, and section 5.3.6, corner setback and intersection visibility (safe sight triangle), may encroach into required front yards. 
(3)  Side yards. Side yards shall extend from the required front setback line to the required rear setback line and be measured from the side lot line. Side setbacks on double-frontage lots shall run the full length between street lot lines. However, the following exceptions shall apply: 
a.  In the SF-10 and SF-7 districts, interior side yards for one-story portions of residences may be reduced to five feet for structures built to HUD standards, UBC standards, IBC and/or IRC standards. 
b.  Development with no side yard setbacks is allowed only for attached townhouses and attached single-family. 
c.  Residential accessory structures that are separated at least ten feet from the principal structure may be constructed in a rear yard; provided, that such accessory structure; does not occupy more than 30 percent of the area of the required rear yard, is not greater than 12 feet in height, and the distance from any part of such structure to a side lot line is at least three feet, except that accessory buildings or structures of 120 square feet or less may extend to the rear and/or side lot line, provided such structures are not greater than ten feet in height, and no portion of the structure crosses into or drains onto adjacent property. 
d.  Mobile homes are subject to the more restrictive standards of section 2.4.32. 
e.  Signs, which are in conformance with the requirements of section 5.8, signs, and section 5.3.6, corner setback and intersection visibility, may encroach into required side yards. 
(4)  Rear yards. Rear yards shall extend the full width of the lot and be measured from the rear lot line. If a corner lot has more than four sides, the yards along the interior lot lines that do not intersect a street line shall be considered rear yards. However, the following exceptions shall apply: 
a.  Whenever a lot abuts to a public alley, one-half of the alley width may be considered part of the rear yard. 
b.  Uncovered porches and decks may encroach into the required rear yard for a distance of not more than 50 percent of the required setback. 
c.  Residential accessory structures that are separated at least ten feet from the principal structure may be constructed in a rear yard; provided, that such accessory structures: 
(1)  Do not occupy more than 30 percent of the area of the required rear yard; 
(2)  Are not greater than 12 feet in height; and 
(3)  The distance from any part of such structure to a rear lot line is at least five feet, and the distance from any part of such structure to a side lot line is at least three feet. 
d.  Except, that accessory buildings or structures of 120 square feet or less may extend to the rear and/or side lot line, provided such structures are not greater than ten feet in height, and no portion of the structure crosses into or drains onto adjacent property. 
(5)  Projections/encroachments, general. The following features may project in required setbacks to the extent indicated. 
a.  Trees, shrubs, flowers, hedges, and other landscape features, provided that no fence, wall, hedge, shrubbery, etc. are not higher than a baseline extending from a point two and one-half feet above walk grade to a point four and one-half feet above walk grade at the depth of the required front yard. Single trees having single trunks that are pruned to a height of seven feet above walk grade are the exception; 
b.  Fences and walls; 
c.  Sidewalks and driveways; 
d.  Architectural features, such as, but not limited to, cornices, chimneys, eaves, stoops and gutters, and ordinary projections of window air conditioners may project up to two feet into the required yards; 
e.  Structural or mechanical devices added to structures to make such structures accessible to physically disadvantaged persons may encroach into required setbacks and buffers; 
f.  Mechanical equipment such as air conditioning units, pool pumps and similar equipment may be located in any required yard; 
g.  Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles; and 
h.  Accessory, open and uncovered swimming pools and home barbecue grills may occupy a required rear yard, provided they are not located closer than five feet to the rear lot line and not closer than three feet to a side lot line. 

(6)  Setback averaging. Where the average of the front setbacks for all lots located within 200 feet of either side of a lot (same side of street) is less than the minimum required front setback, the required setback line may be reduced to this lesser average depth, but in no case, to less than ten feet. For the purpose of computing such average, a vacant lot shall be considered to have the minimum front setback required for the zoning district. 

D.  Height. 
(1)  Measurement. 
a.  Height of buildings shall be measured as the vertical distance in feet between the lowest point where the wall face of the building intersects finished grade along the front of a building to the highest point of the building, i.e.: 
(1)  Top of the highest roof beam on a flat or shed roof; 
(2)  Deck level on a mansard roof; or 
(3)  Average distance between the eaves and apex of a gable, hip, or gambrel roof. 

b.  Height of fences or walls shall be measured as the vertical distance between finished grade on the highest side of the fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall. 
(2)  Exceptions to maximum building height. 
a.  Towers, spires, cupolas, chimneys, elevator penthouses, water tanks, flagpoles, monuments, theater scenery lofts, radio and television antennas, and similar structures and necessary mechanical appurtenances covering not more than 25 percent of the roof area of the structure may exceed the maximum permitted height in the district in which the site is located. Such exceptions shall be subject to the following regulation: Ten feet with no discretionary review. A special use permit shall be required for features extending more than ten feet above the base district height limit. 
b.  Public, semipublic or public service buildings, hospitals, institutions, or schools, when permitted in a district, may be erected to a height not exceeding 60 feet, and churches and temples may be erected to a height not exceeding 75 feet, when the required side and rear yards are each increased by at least one-foot for each one foot of additional building height above the height regulations for the district in which the building is located. 
c.  Residential accessory structures located within required rear yards shall not be greater than 15 feet in height. 
    2.8.4 Building coverage. The portion of a site covered by principal and accessory buildings and structures, as measured from the outside of the building or structure at ground level, and expressed as a percentage of total site area. 

    A. Exception. Building coverage may be increased by up to 50 percent when all required parking is provided underground. 
Sec. 2.3 - Use table. 
    All allowable principal uses, as specified in the table below (Table 2.3), shall be established in permanent structures, except as may be otherwise expressly permitted or inherent to the character of such allowed uses. All of the use categories used in the table are explained in section 2.7. The first column contains use categories and the second column contains a list of specific uses, which provide an abbreviated explanation of the respective use category. If there is a conflict between the abbreviated specific use and the full explanation in section 2.7, the provisions of section 2.7 shall control. The final column of the table contains references to "Use Standards" that apply to the listed use type in all zoning districts and circumstances. The use standards applicable to the respective specific uses are presented in alphabetical order in section 2.4 following the use table. 
    2.3.1 Accessory uses. The regulations that apply to accessory uses are contained in section 2.5. 
    2.3.2 Temporary uses. Temporary uses may be allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the temporary use review procedures. The regulations that apply to temporary uses are contained in section 2.6. Temporary uses are subject to all other applicable provisions of this UDC. 
    2.3.3 Uses not allowed. A blank cell (one without a "P", or "S") indicates that a use type is not allowed in the respective zoning district. Uses not listed may be allowed in accordance with the similar use interpretation provisions of section 2.7.2. 
    2.3.4 Principal uses. 
P Permitted uses: 
A "P" indicates that a use is allowed by right in the respective zoning district and may be reviewed and approved by the director, without public review. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC. 
S Special uses: 
An "S" indicates that a use is allowed only if reviewed and approved as a special use, in accordance with the special use review procedures of section 8.9. Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC. 
Commentary: The use table is organized into five major groups:  Residential use categories  Public, civic and institutional use categories  Retail, service and commercial use categories  Industrial use categories  Other use categories Each major use group is further divided into specific uses. The use category system is based on common functional, product or compatibility characteristics, thereby regulating uses in accordance with criteria directly relevant to the public interest. For a more detailed explanation of the use category system, see section 2.7.1.

Sec. 2.7   Use categories.
    2.7.1 General. Use categories shall be defined or otherwise interpreted in accordance with the following: 
A.  Basis for classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
C.  Developments with multiple principal uses. 
(1)  When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and service category, entertainment-oriented because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. 
(2)  When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. In a development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and gas station, for example, the coffee shop and bookstore would be classified in the retail sales and service, entertainment-oriented category, however, the service station would be classified in the retail sales and service, vehicle services limited. 
D.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. In addition, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
E.  Use of examples. The "examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale warehouse" but which sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category. 
    2.7.2 Similar use interpretations. The standards of this section shall guide officials in making similar use interpretations. 
Commentary: Similar use interpretations, like all administrative decisions, may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of section 8.15, appeals of administrative decisions.  
A.  Authority. If an application is submitted for a use type not listed in the use table, section 2.3, the director shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation, based on the following considerations: 
(1)  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type; 
(2)  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
(3)  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
(4)  The customer type for each activity; 
(5)  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
(6)  Hours of operation; 
(7)  Building and site arrangement; 
(8)  Vehicles used with the activity; 
(9)  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; 
(10)  Signs; 
(11)  How the use advertises itself; and 
(12)  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
B.  Use interpretation standards. 
(1)  No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning district when that use is a permitted or a special use in any other zoning district. 
(2)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and standards of this UDC. 
(3)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning district unless the use is more similar to such uses than to permitted and special uses allowed in other zoning districts. 
(4)  If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a special use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a special use permit, as appropriate. 
C.  Effect of similar use interpretation. No similar use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Farmington or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to special use permits, development permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.

Sec. 2.7   Use categories.
    2.7.1 General. Use categories shall be defined or otherwise interpreted in accordance with the following: 
A.  Basis for classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
C.  Developments with multiple principal uses. 
(1)  When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and service category, entertainment-oriented because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. 
(2)  When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. In a development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and gas station, for example, the coffee shop and bookstore would be classified in the retail sales and service, entertainment-oriented category, however, the service station would be classified in the retail sales and service, vehicle services limited. 
D.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. In addition, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
E.  Use of examples. The "examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale warehouse" but which sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category. 
    2.7.2 Similar use interpretations. The standards of this section shall guide officials in making similar use interpretations. 
Commentary: Similar use interpretations, like all administrative decisions, may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of section 8.15, appeals of administrative decisions.  
A.  Authority. If an application is submitted for a use type not listed in the use table, section 2.3, the director shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation, based on the following considerations: 
(1)  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type; 
(2)  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
(3)  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
(4)  The customer type for each activity; 
(5)  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
(6)  Hours of operation; 
(7)  Building and site arrangement; 
(8)  Vehicles used with the activity; 
(9)  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; 
(10)  Signs; 
(11)  How the use advertises itself; and 
(12)  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
B.  Use interpretation standards. 
(1)  No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning district when that use is a permitted or a special use in any other zoning district. 
(2)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and standards of this UDC. 
(3)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning district unless the use is more similar to such uses than to permitted and special uses allowed in other zoning districts. 
(4)  If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a special use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a special use permit, as appropriate. 
C.  Effect of similar use interpretation. No similar use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Farmington or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to special use permits, development permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.

c.  Minimum lot area requirements shall not apply to dormitories, fraternities, or sororities where no cooking facilities are provided in individual rooms or apartments. 
B.  Lot width. 
(1)  Measurements. Lot width shall be measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the street lot line or its chord. Measurements of lot width shall be made at the required front setback line. When a lot has more than one front setback line, lot width shall be measured along the front setback line with the narrower width. In all cases, the width between side lot lines at their intersection with street lot lines shall be at least 25 feet. 
(2)  Flag lots. The flag pole or panhandle portion of a flag lot shall be subject to the lot width requirements for non-flag lots. 
C.  Required yards (setbacks). 
(1)  Measurements. Required yards refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost wall or wall edge of an allowed structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located. Such yards shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this section. 
(2)  Front and street yards. Front and street yards shall extend the full width of a lot, the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the street lot line and a line parallel thereto on the site. 

Commentary: Required front yards include land or lot areas located between the road right-of-way and the required front setback line. (See also section 2.8.1, residential base zoning district density and dimensional schedule, for setback requirements).  
a.  Corner lots. 
(1)  On back-to-back corner lots a 15-foot street side yard is allowed. However, a fence or wall may be constructed on the property line, provided no driveway access (except RV parking) exists on the street side yard of the subject property or on the property to the rear. If driveway access exists on the subject property or on the lot to the rear, all structures, including fence or wall, must respect the 15-foot street side yard setback and intersection visibility as set forth in section 5.3.6. 
(2)  Where a corner lot abuts an interior side yard of the property to the rear, there shall be a front yard setback on both streets with the street side yard being equal to the front yard of the lot to the rear, but in no case less than 15 feet. 
b.  Double-frontage lots (through lots). In rare case where double frontage (through) lots are approved, a front setback shall be maintained from both streets. 
c.  Flag lots. For flag lots, the flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot shall not be considered part of the front yard, rather the lot line that is closest to and most closely parallel to the access street shall be considered the front lot line. 
d.  Exceptions. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the front and street yard requirements of this UDC, except in the following cases: 
(1)  Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, the depth of a front or side yard setback shall be measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building.

Sec. 2.7 - Use categories. 
    2.7.1 General. Use categories shall be defined or otherwise interpreted in accordance with the following: 
A.  Basis for classifications. Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
B.  Principal uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
C.  Developments with multiple principal uses. 
(1)  When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and service category, entertainment-oriented because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. 
(2)  When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. In a development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and gas station, for example, the coffee shop and bookstore would be classified in the retail sales and service, entertainment-oriented category, however, the service station would be classified in the retail sales and service, vehicle services limited. 
D.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. In addition, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
E.  Use of examples. The "examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale warehouse" but which sells mostly to consumers is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category. 
    2.7.2 Similar use interpretations. The standards of this section shall guide officials in making similar use interpretations. 
Commentary: Similar use interpretations, like all administrative decisions, may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of section 8.15, appeals of administrative decisions.  
A.  Authority. If an application is submitted for a use type not listed in the use table, section 2.3, the director shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation, based on the following considerations: 
(1)  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type; 
(2)  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
(3)  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
(4)  The customer type for each activity; 
(5)  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
(6)  Hours of operation; 
(7)  Building and site arrangement; 
(8)  Vehicles used with the activity; 
(9)  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; 
(10)  Signs; 
(11)  How the use advertises itself; and 
(12)  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
B.  Use interpretation standards. 
(1)  No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning district when that use is a permitted or a special use in any other zoning district. 
(2)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and standards of this UDC. 
(3)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning district unless the use is more similar to such uses than to permitted and special uses allowed in other zoning districts. 
(4)  If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a special use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a special use permit, as appropriate. 
C.  Effect of similar use interpretation. No similar use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Farmington or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to special use permits, development permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.

B.  Lot width. 
(1)  Measurements. Lot width shall be measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the street lot line or its chord. Measurements of lot width shall be made at the required front setback line. When a lot has more than one front setback line, lot width shall be measured along the front setback line with the narrower width. In all cases, the width between side lot lines at their intersection with street lot lines shall be at least 25 feet. 
(2)  Flag lots. The flag pole or panhandle portion of a flag lot shall be subject to the lot width requirements for non-flag lots. 
C.  Required yards (setbacks).

c.  Minimum lot area requirements shall not apply to dormitories, fraternities, or sororities where no cooking facilities are provided in individual rooms or apartments. 
B.  Lot width. 
(1)  Measurements. Lot width shall be measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the street lot line or its chord. Measurements of lot width shall be made at the required front setback line. When a lot has more than one front setback line, lot width shall be measured along the front setback line with the narrower width. In all cases, the width between side lot lines at their intersection with street lot lines shall be at least 25 feet. 
(2)  Flag lots. The flag pole or panhandle portion of a flag lot shall be subject to the lot width requirements for non-flag lots. 
C.  Required yards (setbacks). 
(1)  Measurements. Required yards refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost wall or wall edge of an allowed structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located. Such yards shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this section. 
(2)  Front and street yards. Front and street yards shall extend the full width of a lot, the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the street lot line and a line parallel thereto on the site. 

Commentary: Required front yards include land or lot areas located between the road right-of-way and the required front setback line. (See also section 2.8.1, residential base zoning district density and dimensional schedule, for setback requirements).  
a.  Corner lots. 
(1)  On back-to-back corner lots a 15-foot street side yard is allowed. However, a fence or wall may be constructed on the property line, provided no driveway access (except RV parking) exists on the street side yard of the subject property or on the property to the rear. If driveway access exists on the subject property or on the lot to the rear, all structures, including fence or wall, must respect the 15-foot street side yard setback and intersection visibility as set forth in section 5.3.6. 
(2)  Where a corner lot abuts an interior side yard of the property to the rear, there shall be a front yard setback on both streets with the street side yard being equal to the front yard of the lot to the rear, but in no case less than 15 feet. 
b.  Double-frontage lots (through lots). In rare case where double frontage (through) lots are approved, a front setback shall be maintained from both streets. 
c.  Flag lots. For flag lots, the flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot shall not be considered part of the front yard, rather the lot line that is closest to and most closely parallel to the access street shall be considered the front lot line. 
d.  Exceptions. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the front and street yard requirements of this UDC, except in the following cases: 
(1)  Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, the depth of a front or side yard setback shall be measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building. 
(2)  Uncovered porches and decks may encroach into the required front yard for a distance of not more than six feet. 
(3)  Filling station pumps and pump islands may encroach into required yards, provided that they are not less than 15 feet from the street lines.

ARTICLE 4 - OVERLAY AND SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 4.1 - Planned development (PD). 
    4.1.1 Purpose. The planned development (PD) district is a special purpose district, intended to accommodate combinations of business and residential uses in areas of older structures or vacant land that may include new types of housing, residential/commercial conversions, infill development, starter homes, cluster homes, senior living developments, and planned commercial development. In all cases, new development in the PD district should be adequately served by infrastructure. The PD district is further intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design that ensures neighborhood, resource, and environmental protection, high quality appearance, open space preservation and the provision of amenities and other city goals by: 
A.  Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning standards that were designed primarily for development on individual lots; 
Commentary: Rights and responsibilities are directly linked by the PD district. The PD district provides more flexibility than is otherwise allowed by any base district. Development rights-expressed as allowed uses, and density and dimensional standards-may be (proposed by the developer) increased in exchange for development plans that provide greater benefits to the community that base zoning district. For example, greater height and more flexible uses may be approved in exchange for more "usable open space," in accordance with subsection 4.1.8B. It's a trade-off for increased development rights that benefits both the developer and community.  
B.  Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space and design amenities; and 
C.  Promoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take advantage of special site characteristics, locations and land use arrangements. 
    The PD district is intended to implement the infill and redevelopment policies of the comprehensive plan. It may also be used to implement the planning policies of the comprehensive plan's "mixed use" land use designation in isolated locations throughout the city, including locations along Piñon Hills Boulevard. 
    4.1.2 Applicability. A PD district may be approved only when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city council that a proposed PD project would not negatively affect surrounding property and uses and/or result in a greater benefit to the city than would development under conventional zoning district regulations. 
    4.1.3 Approval procedures. PD district developments shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of section 8.7, zoning map amendments (rezoning). The approved PD master plan shall control development within a PD district.

    4.1.5 Allowed uses. Allowed uses in the PD district shall be established as part of the rezoning application approval process. 
    4.1.6 Density and dimensional standards. Density and dimensional standards in the PD district shall be established as part of the rezoning application approval process. 
    4.1.7 Master plan requirement. In establishing a PD district in accordance with this section, the city council shall require a master plan of the development. The PD master plan shall be approved and filed prior to and as part of the approval. Such required plan and ordinance shall set forth the following: 
A.  A comparison of the proposed development with the standards of the underlying zoning district and a statement by the applicant describing how the proposed development provides greater benefits to the city than would a development carried out in accordance with otherwise applicable zoning and development regulations; 
B.  A narrative addressing the proposed development explaining and tabulating the land uses by net acre, number of dwelling units by housing type, residential density and/or square footage of nonresidential uses per net acre, common open space acreage, potential traffic generation, overall character and architectural style, the relationship of the proposed development to existing development in the area and other related development features; 
C.  A site plan prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 8.5 shall be approved and filed with the findings of fact and conclusions of law as part of the approval; including but not limited to, major streets, major utilities, existing and proposed land uses, entrance locations on existing streets, common open space, landscaping plan and a conceptual drainage plan; 
D.  Density and dimensional standards to be applicable within the PD district; 
E.  Identification of site planning features designed to ensure compatibility between on-site residential and nonresidential uses, and with the surrounding neighborhood and land uses; 
F.  A statement of how the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan; and

Sec. 4.3 - Airport noise overlay (ANO). 
    4.3.1 Purpose. The airport noise overlay (ANO) district is intended to establish standards that assure the long-range, safe, and beneficial use of the Four Corners Regional Airport. ANO district standards are intended to apply in combination with the underlying base zoning district(s) to impose regulations and standards in addition to those required by the base district and to apply whenever they are in conflict with or are more stringent than those in the base district. 
    4.3.2 Applicability. ANO District standards apply to properties located within the boundaries of the noise compatibility zones near, or adjacent to Four Corners Regional Airport as shown on the official zoning map and as described below: 
A.  In order to carry out the provisions of this section, the ANO district shall be divided into the following day/night equivalent sound level zones, which are computed according to United States Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Procedures: 
(1)  LDN Zone 1-Designated area over which the noise rating is less than 65 LDN. 
(2)  LDN Zone 2-Designated area over which the noise rating is between 65 and 70 LDN. 
(3)  LDN Zone 3-Designated area over which the noise rating is between 70 and 75 LDN. 
(4)  LDN Zone 4-Designated area over which the noise rating exceeds 75 LDN. 
B.  The boundaries of the ANO and the above zones are hereby established as shown in the official zoning map, entitled "Airport Noise Overlay Map for the Four Corners Regional Airport." 
C.  The boundaries of the above zones establish expected airport area intermittent noise levels, based on average ambient conditions and existing and projected aircraft operations. The effect of noise generated by any other specific use is not reflected in the LDN contours. No assurance is made or intended, nor should it in any way be interpreted, that a specific use considered compatible within an LDN Zone area will meet the noise safety standards, and no use determined compatible shall be allowed unless it is determined that the use will meet the noise safety standards for that zone. 
    4.3.3 Density and dimensional standards. All uses in the ANO district shall be subject to the density and dimensional standards of the underlying zoning district, except as modified by any adopted airport master plan. 
    4.3.4 Allowed uses. Uses are allowed in the ANO district shall be as follows: 
A.  Any development which is proposed that is in more than one zone shall be limited to the more restrictive zone.

Sec. 4.4 - Residential preservation overlay (RPO). 
    4.4.1 Purpose. The residential preservation (RPO) overlay zoning district is intended to facilitate adaptive re-use and preservation of older residential structures, and compatible new development. RPO district uses are encouraged to occupy existing residential structures without changing the character of such structures, and to emphasize pedestrian rather than vehicular access. The requirements of the overlay district shall apply whenever they are in conflict with or are more stringent than those in the base district. 
    The RPO district is intended to implement the residential planning policies of the comprehensive plan's "Mixed Use" land use designation, and policies applicable to the civic center neighborhood as described in Chapter 6, downtown neighborhoods. 
    4.4.2 Applicability. RPO district standards shall apply to the development of the following uses on properties identified on the official zoning map: 
A.  New multifamily residential and nonresidential construction; 
B.  An addition to an existing nonresidential building, or an interior or exterior remodeling of any existing building equal to 50 percent or more of the building's value (in the opinion of the director) at the time of permit application; and 
C.  Whenever there is a change in use (rezoning or special use permit) for which any city approvals are required. 
    4.4.3 Allowed uses. Uses are allowed in the RPO district shall be in accordance with underling zoning district standards of the use table of section 2.3. 
    4.4.4 Density and dimensional standards. All development in the RPO district is subject to the density and dimensional regulations of the underlying zoning district standards specified in section 2.8, density and dimensional standards, other applicable provisions of this UDC. 
    4.4.5 District standards. In addition to standards of the underlying zoning district and other applicable standards of this UDC, all development in the RPO district shall be subject to the approval of a "Certificate of Appropriateness" in accordance with the procedures of section 8.9, special use permits and the following standards: 
A.  Where an existing single-family residence is converted to a duplex or nonresidential use, there shall be no additional entrances or other visible changes on the facade of the unit facing the street. Modifications to the side or rear of the home shall, to the extent possible, conform to the design of the original residence. Any exterior stairs shall be placed onto the rear of the residence, or where rear placement is infeasible, onto the side of the residence. Exterior stairs shall be compatible in treatment to the original residence. 
B.  To the extent practical, all parking shall be located in a rear yard. All parking shall be accessed from an alley, where alley access is available, or from a single common driveway where such alley access is not available. Paving of the front yard for parking shall be prohibited. 
C.  All new structures and complete renovation shall incorporate some of the desirable design elements common to the civic center neighborhood, such as front porches, pitched roofs, gables, chimneys, picket fenced front yards. 
D.  Front setbacks and maximum height shall be influenced by (increased or decreased) by the adjacent or nearest buildings to ensure compatibility and consistency. 
Sec. 4.5 - Special mobile home area overlay (SMHAO). 
    4.5.1 Purpose. The special mobile home area overlay (SMHAO) district is intended provide for existing situations and is not expected to be applied to additional area in the future. The SMHOA district shall apply in combination with the underlying base zoning district to impose regulations and standards in addition to those required by the base district. The requirements of the overlay district shall apply whenever they are in conflict with or are more stringent than those in the base district. 
    4.5.2 Applicability. SMHAO district standards shall apply to the development of the following uses on properties identified on the official zoning map. 
    4.5.3 Allowed uses. Uses are allowed in the SMHAO district shall be in accordance with underlining zoning district standards of the use table of section 2.3. 
    4.5.4 Density and dimensional standards. All development in the SMHAO district is subject to the density and dimensional standards of underlying zoning district standards specified in section 2.8, density and dimensional standards, other applicable provisions of this UDC. 
    4.5.5 District standards. In addition to standards of the underlying zoning district and other applicable standards of this UDC, all mobile home development in the SMHAO district shall comply with the use standards of section 2.4.32, mobile homes and manufactured home, single section.

B.  Schedule B. Schedule B uses have widely varying parking demands, making it difficult to specify a single requirement. The off-street parking requirement for such uses shall be established by the director based on estimates of parking demand, which may include recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), data collected from uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use, or other relevant information. The director may require that the applicant submit a parking study that provides analysis and justification for the proposed number of spaces to be provided. Parking studies shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. The director shall review the submitted study along with any other traffic engineering and planning data that are appropriate and establish the off-street parking or loading requirements for the use proposed. 
    5.2.4 Minimum off-street loading space requirements. 
A.  Every building (or part thereof) erected or occupied for retail business, service, manufacturing, storage, warehousing, hotel, mortuary, or any other use similarly involving the receipt or distribution by vehicles or materials or merchandise, shall provide and maintain on the same premises loading space in accordance with the following requirements: 
Gross Floor Area (GFA) Number of Required Loading Spaces Less than 25,000 square feet None 25,000-75,000 square feet 1 75,001-125,000 square feet 2 Each additional 100,000 square feet 1  
  
B.  In addition to the above required off-street loading spaces, the director may require additional spaces if, in his opinion, a given use or extraordinary site characteristics warrant them. 
    5.2.5 Rules for computing parking and loading requirements. The following rules shall apply when computing the number of parking and loading spaces required under this section: 
A.  Fractions. When calculation of the number of required spaces results in a fractional number, a fraction shall be rounded down to the next whole number. 
B.  Distances. Distances shall be measured between nearest off-street parking facility and nearest primary entrance of the building or use to be served. 
C.  Multiple uses. When two or more uses or separate establishments are located within the same development, off-street parking shall be provided for each use or separate establishment unless a shared parking plan is approved under the provisions of subsection 5.2.8C. If one or more uses within a multi-use development are of a size that would otherwise exempt them from compliance with off-street parking requirements, only one such exemption shall be permitted to be taken for the entire development. 
D.  Floor area. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square footage-based off-street parking and loading standards shall be computed on the basis of the sum of the gross horizontal floor areas of all the floors of a building or structure. Such floor areas shall be measured from the exterior faces of exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two buildings or structures, but excluding stairwells (at each floor), elevator shafts and floors or parts of floors devoted exclusively to vehicular parking or loading. 
E.  Seating. 
(1)  When seating consists of benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each 24 linear inches of seating space shall be counted as one seat. 
(2)  Where parking requirements relate to movable seating in auditoriums and other assembly rooms, 15 square feet of floor area shall be construed to be equal to one seat, except where otherwise specified. Floor area shall be the actual area occupied by seating and related aisles, and shall not include accessory unoccupied areas or the thickness of walls. 
F.  Employees, students and other occupants. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on the number of employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated or licensed capacity, whichever is applicable. In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as beds. 
G.  New and unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not listed in the parking and loading schedules of this section, the director shall apply the standards of the listed use that is deemed most similar to the use proposed or require that a parking study be submitted pursuant to the requirements of subsection 5.2.3B., Schedule B. 
    5.2.6 Off-street parking location. 
A.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use (See: Section 5.2.7, alternative parking plans). 
B.  Off-street parking shall be permitted in the required front yard of any residential district, provided that: 
(1)  Such parking shall not interfere with the street frontage landscaping required for multifamily and nonresidential uses by section 5.5.5. 
(2)  No more than 50 percent of the required front yard may be used for off-street parking or for a driveway providing access to a garage, carport or parking area located behind the front yard setback. This subsection shall not preclude construction of circular drives in accordance with subsection 5.2.11F(4). 
(3)  No recreational vehicles, except truck-mounted campers utilized for everyday transportation, may be parked within seven feet of the back curbline, or in the street as specified in Municipal Code, sections 25-4-9 and 25-4-10. 
(4)  No off-street parking shall be permitted in the required front yard of any residential district except upon a driveway providing access to a garage, carport or parking area of the dwelling. 
C.  No residential garage shall be modified or converted to prevent its use as a parking structure unless there is on-premises, off-street parking in compliance with this section; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to lots in subdivisions approved prior to the adoption of Ordinance Number 444 on April 9, 1969. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1248, § 1, 7-12-2011) 
    5.2.7 Commercial vehicle restrictions in residential districts. 
A.  Except as provided in subsection B. below, all "commercial vehicles," including self-propelled vehicles with or without trailers, having a weight class of 11,501 gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) or more individually, or combined, and all commercial trailers, are prohibited from parking in any residential zoning district (street or lot). 
B.  The parking of a commercial vehicle in a residential zoning district (street or lot), is permitted, provided that: 
(1)  Said commercial vehicle is standing on a temporary basis for the purpose of loading or unloading; or 
(2)  Said commercial vehicle is providing other services common to residential areas. 
C.  As used in this section, "commercial vehicle" shall mean a motor vehicle of a type required to be registered under the New Mexico Motor Vehicle Code or any other federal, tribal, state or foreign country motor vehicle code, which vehicle primarily is used or maintained for the transportation of persons for hire, compensation, or profit, or designed, used or maintained primarily for the transportation of property, goods, wares, equipment or merchandise for sale to customers. However, a vehicle registered as a "horseless carriage" or "classic vehicle" under the New Mexico Motor Vehicle Code shall not be considered a commercial vehicle. 
D.  Commercial vehicles parked in residential districts after the January 1, 2008, effective date of the Unified Development Code (UDC) shall not be allowed to continue in violation of this section after June 1, 2008, and the provisions of sections 9.1.1, 9.1.2 and 9.1.3 of the UDC (sometimes referred to as "grandfather" clauses), shall not apply to the commercial vehicles which are the subject of this section. 
E.  Any violation of this chapter shall be punished in accordance with section 1-1-10 of the Farmington City Code as noted in section 10.3 of the UDC. 
    5.2.8 Alternative parking plans. The director shall be authorized to approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street parking spaces required by off-street parking Schedule "A" (subsection 5.2.3A.) in accordance with this subsection. 
A.  General. 
(1)  Procedure. Alternative parking plans shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of section 8.13, administrative adjustments. 
(2)  Recordation of approved plans. An attested copy of an approved alternative parking plan must be filed in the community development department. An alternative parking plan may be amended by following the same procedure required for the original approval. The applicant shall provide proof of recordation prior to approval of the building permit. 
(3)  Violations. Violations of an approved alternative parking plan constitute a violation of the Code and will be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of Article 10. 
B.  Off-site parking. The director may approve the location of required off-street parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with the all of the following standards: 
(1)  Ineligible activities. Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores, or other convenience oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site. 
(2)  Location. No off-site parking space may be located more than 300 feet from the primary entrance of the use served (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian route) unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than 60 feet, unless a grade separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
(3)  Zoning classification. Off-site parking areas require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served. 
(4)  Agreement for off-site parking. 
a.  In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement between the record owners will be required. The agreement must guarantee the use of the off-site parking area for at least ten years. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the director for filing in form established by the city attorney. Prior to the issuance of a building permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy for any use to be served by off-site parking areas, filing of the agreement must take place in the community development department. 
b.  An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with section 5.2.3, minimum off-street parking requirements. No use shall be continued if the parking is removed unless substitute-parking facilities are provided, and the director shall be notified at least 60 days prior to the termination of a lease for off-site parking. 
C.  Shared parking. The director may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with the all of following standards: 
(1)  Location. Shared parking spaces must be located within 300 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
(2)  Zoning classification. Shared parking areas require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served. 
(3)  Shared parking study. Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the director that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must be provided in a form established by the director and made available to the public. It must address, at a minimum, the size, and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. 
(4)  Agreement for shared parking. A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the director for recordation in a form established by the city attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with section 5.2.3, minimum off-street parking requirements. 
D.  Other eligible alternatives. The director may approve any other alternative to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the proposed plan will do at least as good a job protecting surrounding neighborhoods, maintaining traffic circulation patterns and promoting quality urban design than would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
E.  Use of off-street parking areas. Required off-street parking areas are to be used solely for the parking of licensed, motor vehicles in operating condition. Required spaces may not be used for the display of goods for sale or lease or for long-term storage of vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile homes, or building materials. 
    5.2.9 Vehicle stacking areas. The vehicle stacking standards of this subsection shall apply unless otherwise expressly approved by the director. 
A.  Minimum number of spaces. Off-street stacking spaces shall be provided as follows: 
ACTIVITY TYPE MINIMUM STACKING SPACES MEASURED FROM Bank teller lane 5 Teller or window Automated teller machine 3 Teller Restaurant drive-through 6 Order box Car wash stall, automatic 6 Entrance Car wash stall, self-service 3 Entrance Day care center 4 Entrance Gasoline pump island 2 Pump island Quick lube bays 2 Entrance Other Determined by director based on traffic study  
  
B.  Size. Stacking spaces must be a minimum of nine feet by 20 feet in size. 
C.  Location. Stacking spaces may not impede on- or off-site traffic movements or movements into or out of off-street parking spaces.

Sec. 5.5 - Landscaping and screening. 
    5.5.1 Purpose. The section provides standards for the installation and maintenance of landscaping, walls, and screening devices in order to preserve and enhance the natural environment and beauty of the city, to minimize the adverse effects of development, and to promote the general welfare of the citizens of Farmington. Landscaping materials, including ground cover, shrubs, and trees facilitate the control of erosion and the reduction of glare and dust, and soften the visual impact of building masses. Walls and screening devices allow the separation of potentially incompatible uses and the buffering of road noise and intensive activities. Landscaping, walls and screening devices together, help to effectuate privacy, logical development, and enhancement of property values. In order to preserve the unique natural character of the city, these standards emphasize the retention of native trees, shrubs, rock formations, and other natural site features. To conserve water resources, use of drought-tolerant plant materials and efficient irrigation systems is encouraged. (See xeriscaping report provided in appendices). 
    5.5.2 Applicability. This section shall apply to all portions of street yards, as defined in section 11.1, terms defined, associated with the following development: 
A.  All new construction, not including additions or modifications, in multifamily and nonresidential development; 
B.  Enlargement exceeding 1,000 square feet or 30 percent of the floor area of an existing multifamily or nonresidential structure, whichever is greater, for which a building permit is required; including cumulative enlargements totaling 30 percent or 1,000 square feet or greater made over a period of five years; 
C.  Expansion of an existing parking lot to accommodate additional parking (to apply to the expansion area only); and

All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the approved landscape or screening plan and according to sound nursery practices in a manner designed to encourage vigorous growth. All landscape material and irrigation improvements shall be in place prior to issuance of the final certificate of occupancy unless an extension is approved by the director and a deferred completion agreement is executed. Irrigation systems shall be installed by a licensed installer. 
D.  Maintenance requirements. Trees, shrubs, fences, walls, irrigation improvements, and other landscape features depicted on plans approved by the city shall be considered elements of the project in the same manner as parking, building materials and other details are elements of the plan. The landowner, or successors in interest, or agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the following: 
(1)  Regular maintenance of all landscaping and irrigation improvements in good condition and in a way that presents a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. All landscaping shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds, and litter. This maintenance shall include weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing, edging, mulching or other maintenance, as needed and in accordance with acceptable horticultural practices; 
(2)  The repair or replacement of required landscape structures (e.g., walls, fences) to a structurally sound condition; and 
(3)  The regular maintenance, repair, or replacement, where necessary, of any landscaping required by this section. Any plant materials not surviving shall be replaced within 30 days of its demise or in the next appropriate season. 
E.  Landscape material standards. 
(1)  General design. Plant materials shall be selected for: energy efficiency and drought tolerance; adaptability and relationship to the Farmington environment; color, form and pattern; ability to provide shade; and soil retention. The overall landscape plan shall be integrated with all elements of the project, such as buildings, parking lots, and streets, to achieve a desirable microclimate and minimize energy demand. 
(2)  Plant quality. Plants installed to satisfy the requirements of this section shall meet or exceed the plant quality and species standards of the New Mexico Association of Nursery Industries. Plants shall be adapted to the local area. No artificial plants or vegetation shall be used to meet any standards of this section unless approved by a landscaping plan. 
(3)  Plant sizes and specifications. The following minimum plant size requirements shall apply to the minimum landscaping requirements. Plantings in addition to the landscaping requirements may be of a different size. 
PLANT TYPE/MINIMUM PLANT SIZES Deciduous trees 1-inch caliper (measured one-foot above ground) Evergreen trees 4 feet tall Shrubs 1-gallon container size plus 9 inches tall Perennials 4-inch pots  
(4)  Ground treatments. 
a.  Rock mulch. Rock mulch shall be installed and maintained at a minimum depth of two inches and a maximum depth of four inches on all planted areas except where ground cover plants are fully established. 
b.  Grass seed and sod. Turf areas shall be planted with species suitable as permanent lawns in Farmington. Turf areas may be sodded or seeded. Additional maintenance shall be provided until coverage is complete. 
Commentary: Lawns planted with low water use grasses such as Blue Gramma (Bouteloua Gracilis), or buffalo grass may be economically grown from seed, make attractive desert lawns, require less maintenance, and can cut your landscape water bill by up to 80 percent. (The administrator can recommend possible sources for such grass seed.) 
(Granite seed: 801.768.4422)  
c.  Other. Other ground covers suitable for the soil and climate conditions of the area may be approved within required landscape areas. 
(5)  Species. Tree and plant species provided to meet the landscaping and screening standards of this section shall comply with recommendations of the director as outlined in the city guidelines. 
Sec. 5.6 - Floodplains. 
    5.6.1 Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area. 
    5.6.2 Applicability. This section shall apply to all development in areas of special flood hazards within the corporate limits of the City of Farmington. 
    5.6.3 Statutory authority. The legislature of the state has, pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 3-18-7, delegated the responsibility to local governments to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain and adopt this section. 
    5.6.4 General provisions. 
A.  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
B.  Methods of reducing flooding. In order to accomplish its purpose, this section uses the following methods of reducing flood losses: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
C.  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Farmington", dated May 15, 2002, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), which shows flood hazard areas and designated floodways are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section. The flood insurance study is on file at the floodplain administrator's office at 800 Municipal Drive, Farmington, New Mexico. The flood insurance study is the minimum area of applicability of this section and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this section and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. 
D.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. 
E.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
F.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the city council; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
G.  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
    5.6.5 Administration. The floodplain regulations of this section shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of section 7.7, floodplain administrator. 
    5.6.6 General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the following are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
A.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
B.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
C.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
D.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
E.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
F.  New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
G.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
    5.6.7 Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsection 5.6.4C., basis for establishing the areas of special flood Hazard; or where the basis has not been established, subsection 7.7.2H., powers and duties, the following are required: 
A.  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in subsection 13.2.15A. is satisfied. (The city engineer does not have authority to waive this requirement.) 
B.  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have either the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so if the base is below flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer shall develop or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which such structures are flood-proofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
C.  Enclosure. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(2)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. 
(3)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
D.  Manufactured and mobile homes. 
(1)  Manufactured and mobile homes to be placed within Zone A (on a community's FHBM or FIRM) shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(2)  Manufactured and mobile homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE (on the community's FIRM) on-sites, either: 
a.  Outside of a manufactured or mobile home park or subdivision; 
b.  In manufactured home or mobile park or subdivision completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations; 
c.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured or mobile home park or subdivision; 
d.  In an existing manufactured and mobile home park or subdivision on which a manufactured or mobile home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood; or 
e.  Be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(3)  Manufactured and mobile homes placed or substantially improved on-sites in an existing manufactured or mobile home parks or subdivisions within Zones A1-30, AH and AE (on the community's FIRM) that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection 5.6.7D. shall be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured or mobile home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
b.  The manufactured or mobile home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than three feet in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
E.  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on-sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE (on the community's FIRM) shall either: 
(1)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, 
(2)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
(3)  Comply with the permit requirements of section 8.10 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection 5.6.7D. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
    5.6.8 Standards for subdivision. 
A.  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with subsection 5.6.4A., findings of fact; subsection 5.6.4B., methods of reducing flooding; and subsection 5.6.4C., basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
B.  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of subsection 5.6.4A., findings of fact; subsection 5.6.4B., methods of reducing flooding and Article 11, definitions. 
C.  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to subsection 5.6.4C., basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, or where the basis has not been established, subsection 7.7.2H. 
D.  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
E.  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
    5.6.9 Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 5.6.4C., basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following apply: 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
B.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
C.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
D.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
E.  A registered professional engineer shall submit a certification of elevation to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as required by subsection 13.2.15A., are satisfied. 
F.  Within zone AH or AO, adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
    5.6.10 Floodways. Areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 5.6.4C., basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, are areas designated as floodways. Since a floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following shall apply: 
A.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodways unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection 5.6.10A., above, is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction sections of this article. 
C.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR, Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community and/or the developer first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA and is granted a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) by FEMA. 
Sec. 5.7 - Drainage, natural or historic drainageways. 
    5.7.1 Purpose. This section is intended to supplement the subdivision drainage requirements of section 5.6 and to protect drainageways from alteration in order to uphold their primary function as stormwater facilities. Developments within FEMA-delineated floodplain boundaries shall adhere to the floodplain regulations of section 5.6. For purposes of this section drainageways shall be defined as follows: 
A.  Drainageways. Drainageways shall be defined to mean a channel, typically earthen, that conveys stormwater onto, across and/or off a property-Drainageways may or may not start on the subject property. 
    5.7.2 Drainageways. All development, including fences and walls, proposed on properties containing natural or historic drainageways shall be subject to the following hierarchy of requirements: 
A.  Avoid development in a natural or historic drainageway. Restrict development to area (portion of a site) that is not within a natural or historic drainageway where such area exists on a site sufficient to make reasonable economic use of property. 
Commentary: If development within natural or historic drainageway can reasonably be avoided, one must. Otherwise, development rights may be reduced; or, where reasonable mitigation is not demonstrated by the applicant, all development may be prohibited.  
B.  Minimize development in a natural or historic drainageway. Where development is allowed within a natural or historic drainageway, the diversity of permitted uses in a zone district and permitted residential land use densities may be limited or reduced as necessary to minimize potential dangers to structures or persons. 
C.  Realignment of drainageway. Realignment of drainageways will be allowed where engineering is provided to insure that the realignment remains. Diversion structures and the realigned channel, pipe or structure will need to be designed by a licensed engineer. If a proposed realignment will change ingress or egress locations on the property then written approval of the adjoining property owners shall be required prior to approval of the realignment. Any and all cost of the realignment on the property or the adjoining property shall be solely the responsibility of the developer. 
D.  Prohibit development in a natural or historic drainageway. Development shall only be prohibited in a natural and historic drainageway where one or more of the following conditions is found to exist: 
(1)  Site planning and engineering techniques described in section 5.6, floodplains, cannot reasonably mitigate potential hazards to public health, safety and welfare; or 
(2)  Alteration will limit or reduce the primary function of natural and historic drainages as storm water facilities; or 
(3)  Development will cause persons (other than the developer) or the city to incur expenses required to: 
a.  Mitigate hazardous conditions; 
b.  Respond to emergencies created by such conditions; or 
c.  Rehabilitate improvements and lands. 
    5.7.3 Supplementary drainage requirements. Where drainage detention improvements, including detention basin(s), have not yet been constructed for a site, all nonresidential and multifamily development with more than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface shall be subject to the following requirements: 
A.  Drainage detention basin. A detention basin shall be provided where necessary, to limit post development flows to pre-development flow rates and sediment loading. Such basin(s) shall be capable of handling the calculated difference between historic flows and the anticipated post-development 25-year frequency storms for maximum period of intensity within the entire project boundary in which the proposed structure is to be located. Maintenance of all such drainage improvements shall be the responsibility of the property owner, unless otherwise accepted by the city for ownership and maintenance. 
B.  Design. Drainage improvements shall be designed in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  A New Mexico-registered engineer shall design and certify drainage improvements. 
(2)  Adequate provision for short- and long-term ownership, maintenance, and operation of the storm water management system shall be required. 
(3)  Where water velocities may reasonably be expected to cause erosion problems, satisfactory means shall be provided to prevent such erosion, including concrete head walls and wing walls where conditions require. 
(4)  Water supply systems and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters. 
Sec. 5.8 - Signs. 
    5.8.1 Purpose. The purposes of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the pleasing look of the city; to preserve Farmington as a city that is attractive to business; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; and to otherwise implement relevant provisions of the Farmington Comprehensive Plan. 
Commentary: For purposes of this section, a site refers to the entire project as planned and developed together as follows:  A single apartment complex shall be considered as occupying one site.  A shopping center, including out-parcels and separate buildings within it (regardless of whether ownership is common or separate) shall be considered as occupying one site.  A group of office buildings, warehouses or industrial buildings under common ownership or management and approved within one site plan with the city, shall be considered as occupying one site.  In general, buildings that share parking or access shall be presumed to occupy one site, subject to proof by the owners that the nature of the sharing arrangement is such that it should not be considered determinative for purposes of this UDC.  
    Urban design is a major emphasis of the comprehensive plan (adopted October 8, 2002). In particular Chapter 10 of the plan provides design guidelines recognizing expressly that "improvements to the appearance of one element (of urban design) will foster improvements in other areas. The city's sign standards should include regulations for maximum allowable signage for wall, ground, window signs, sign-spacing and even recommend styles in keeping with the desired overall visual appearance, formed through a consensus of citizens and elected officials." 
    In that context, the city continuously invests in parks, trails, landscaping, quality public facilities and other features and amenities that enhance the attractiveness of the community; a major purpose of this UDC is to ensure that signs in the community are compatible with the image that the city seeks and in which the city continuously invests. 
    5.8.2 Permit required. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, all persons erecting, hanging, installing, or otherwise placing signs in the city must first obtain a sign permit in accordance with the procedures of section 8.4, sign permits; provided, however, that a permit is not required where only the changeable copy is changed, or the sign is cleaned, painted, repainted, or for normal maintenance and repair. 
    5.8.3 Signs allowed without a permit. The following signs are exempt from the requirements of this UDC, but remain subject to the building code requirements: 
A.  Any public notice or warning required by a valid and applicable federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance; 

B.  Traffic control signs installed by city or state agencies on public property or rights-of-way, such as "Stop," "Yield" and similar signs; 
C.  Any sign inside a building that is not attached to a window or door; 
D.  Signs that are not visible beyond the boundaries of the lot or parcel on which they are located or from any public rights-of-way; 
E.  Any sign inside an athletic field or other enclosed outdoor space, where the sign is not legible from ground level and not visible from public right-of-way beyond the lot line of the site on which it is located; 
F.  Works of art with no commercial message; 
G.  Holiday decorations with no commercial message displayed between November 15 and January 15; 
H.  Flags used as political or religious symbols; 
I.  Flags used solely for decoration and not containing any copy or logo; 
J.  Window signs; 
K.  Construction signs for residential or nonresidential construction saying "construction entrance", "financing provided by..." or providing similar information, subject to the conditions applicable to "residential sign," including the prohibition of commercial messages; provided, however, that such signs shall not exceed, 32 square feet and shall be removed no later than the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the premises or any part thereof; and 
L.  Balloons and/or other gas-filled objects located in any zoning district; which balloon and/or gas filled object shall not exceed 20 feet in height and shall not contain or display any logo but shall be used solely for decorative purposes. 
Commentary:  If a sign is inside a building and cannot be seen by a person of ordinary eyesight who is outside the building, it is exempt from regulation under this section; or  If a sign is inside and athletic field or other enclosed outdoor space and cannot be seen by a person of ordinary eyesight who is outside the field or other enclosed space, it is exempt from regulation under this section; or  If a sign is inside a breezeway or entranceway, under the roof and within the foundation line of the building but outside the actual entrance door, and such sign cannot be seen by a person of ordinary eyesight who is not under the roof of the building or is otherwise outside the building, it is exempt from regulation under this section; or  If a sign inside a building, breezeway or entranceway or athletic field is visible from outside the building or athletic field, if there are no words and/or commercial message (such as a logo or an illustration related to a commercial enterprise operated on the premises) that can be read or understood by a person of ordinary eyesight standing outside the building or other enclosed space, it is exempt from regulation under this section; or  If a sign inside a building or athletic field is visible from outside the building or athletic field and the works and/or commercial message on it can be read or understood by a person of ordinary eyesight from outside the building or enclosed space but cannot be read by such person from the public right-of-way or from other private property (in the case of single-occupancy property) or from any parking lot or driving lanes (in the case of shopping centers and other multi-occupancy property), then it shall be exempt from regulation under this section; or  A sign inside a building or athletic field that can be read or understood by a person of ordinary eyesight standing on public right-of-way, other private property or, in the case of multi-occupancy property, on any parking lot or in any driving lane, shall be subject to regulation under this section.  
    5.8.4 Prohibited signs. All signs not expressly permitted under this section or exempt from regulation hereunder in accordance with the previous section are prohibited. Such signs include, but are not limited to: 
A.  Any sign that copies or imitates an official sign or purports to have official status; 
B.  Strings of lights, except for holiday decorations, which are exempt pursuant to subsection 5.8.3G.; 
C.  Beacons; 
D.  Windblown devices; 
E.  Pennants; 
F.  Flashing signs; 
G.  Portable signs: Portable A-frame and T-frame signs removed at the close of each business day, portable trailer-mounted or changeable signs are not allowed. 
H.  Moving signs; 

I.  Any sign on or extending above the roofline, which is illustrated at right; 
J.  Any sign attached to an accessory structure, except an incidental sign, if such sign is legible from the public right-of-way or from other property; and 
K.  Any other attention-attracting device, except for those conforming to the dimensional, design, lighting, and other standards applicable to a sign in the same location. 
    5.8.5 Computation and measurement. 
A.  Area computation of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, base, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of this UDC and is clearly incidental to the display itself. For a single wall, all pieces of information or other graphic representations on that wall shall be measured as though part of one sign, encompassed within one rectangle, which may not exceed the maximum permitted sign area. 

B.  Area computation of multi-faced signs. Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less, only one display face shall be measured in computing sign area. If the two faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the larger face. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multi-faced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign. Sign area of multi-faced signs is calculated based on the principle that all sign elements that can be seen at one time or from one vantage point should be considered in measuring the size of the sign. 


C.  Sign height computation. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: existing grade prior to construction; or newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the site, whichever is lower. 

D.  Building frontage. Building frontage shall mean the horizontal length of a building (building length) on the side with its principal entrance. If that side is a straight wall, then the building frontage shall be the length of the wall. If the side is not a straight wall, the building frontage shall be the horizontal distance from the corner at one end of the side of the building with the principal entrance to the other corner on the same side of the building; where that side of the building is concave, then the measurement shall be made in a straight line from corner to corner; where the side of the building is convex or has one or more sections that project in front of the front corners, then the measurement shall be made as the shortest distance between two lines projected from the two front corners of the building, with such lines parallel to each other and as close as practicable to perpendicular to the front of the building. 
E.  Street frontage. Street frontage shall mean the horizontal length of the street frontage along the subject lot side and shall be measured in accordance with the requirements of subsection 2.8.3B., lot width.

No owner or operator of any operation or use in any district shall permit, cause, suffer or allow visible emissions to equal or exceed an opacity of 20 percent; provided, however, stationary combustion equipment which is regulated by state law [Parts 20.2.10 NMAC through 20.2.18 NMAC, and 20.2.42 NMAC, and any other part of chapter] is exempt from this requirement. 
B.  Opacity determinations. Opacity of emissions from equipment that is subject to the requirements of subsection 5.11.5A., above, shall be determined in accordance with the method established by US EPA in 40 CFR, Part 60 Appendix A, Method 9, or any other method receiving prior approval from the New Mexico State Department of Health. The minimum time period for taking opacity readings shall be ten minutes. 
C.  Dust and particulate matter. All land uses, including but not limited to open storage and open processing operations, and on-site transportation movements, which are the source of wind or airborne dust or other particulate matter; and processes involving dust or other particulate air contaminant generating equipment such as used in paint spraying, grain handling, sand or gravel processing or storage or sand blasting) shall be so conducted that dust and other particulate matter are not transported across the boundary line of the tract on which the use is located. 
    5.11.6 Odorous matter. 
A.  Odor threshold. No use shall be located or operated in any district that involves the emission of odorous matter from a source of operation where the odorous matter exceeds the odor threshold at the bounding property line or at any point beyond the tract on which such use or operation is located. The odor threshold shall be the concentration of odorous matter in the atmosphere necessary to be perceptible to the olfactory nerve of a normal person. 
B.  Measurement. The odor threshold as herein set forth shall be determined by observation by a person or persons. In any case, where uncertainty may arise or where the operator or owner of an odor emitting use may disagree with the enforcing officer or where specific measurement of odor concentration is required, the method and procedures as specified by American Society for Testing Materials, A.S.T.M.D. 1391 57, entitled "Standard Method for Measurement of Odor in Atmospheres" shall be used and a copy of A.S.T.M.D. 1391 57 is hereby incorporated by reference. 
C.  Exception to odorous matter. The provisions of this subsection shall not normally be applied to restaurants and the emission of odorous matter normally associate with food preparation directly associated with restaurants. 
    5.11.7 Fire and explosive hazard material. 
A.  Explosives. No use involving the manufacture or storage of compounds or products that decompose by detonation shall be permitted in any district except that chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, phosphorus and similar substances and compounds in small quantities for use by industry, school laboratories, druggists, or wholesalers may be permitted when approved by the fire marshall as not presenting a fire or explosion hazard. 
B.  Flammables. The storage and use of all flammable liquids and materials such as pyroxylin plastics, nitrocellulose film, solvents, and petroleum products shall be permitted only when such storage or use conforms to the standards and regulations of the City of Farmington. 
    5.11.8 Toxic and noxious matter. No operation or use in any district shall emit a concentration across the bounding property line of the tract on which such operation or use is located of toxic or noxious matter that will exceed ten percent of the concentration (exposure) considered as the threshold limit for an industrial worker as such standards are established by the New Mexico State Department of Health. 
    5.11.9 Vibration. No operation or use in any district shall at any time create earth-borne vibration that, when measured at the bounding property line of the source of operation, exceed the limit of displacement set forth in the following table in the frequency ranges specified. 
Frequency 
(cycles per second) Displacement 
(in inches) Less than 10 .0010 10 to 20 .0008 20 to 30 .0005 30 to 40 .0004 40 and Over .0003

ARTICLE 6 - SUBDIVISION STANDARDS 

Sec. 6.1 - Purpose. 
    The subdivision of land is a major factor in the process of sound community growth and ultimately becomes a public responsibility in that the streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. Therefore, it is to the interest of the public, to the developer, and to the future owners, that subdivisions be conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. It is in the intent of these regulations to encourage the growth of the City of Farmington in an orderly manner. 
Sec. 6.2 - Applicability. 
    This article shall govern all plats and subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Farmington, New Mexico, and within five miles thereof of its corporate limits, or as established by the New Mexico Municipal Code section 14-19-5 (NMSA 1978, § 3-20-5). 
Sec. 6.3 - Building lots. 
    No electrical service and, where applicable, no permit for the construction of a building or buildings upon any lot, tract or parcel shall be issued until a building lot, tract or parcel has been created by compliance with one of the following conditions: 
A.  Platted subdivisions. The lot, tract or parcel is part of a plat of record, properly approved and filed in the plat records of San Juan County, New Mexico, in which case, a building permit may be issued conforming to all requirements of this UDC; or 
B.  Lots of record. The lot, tract or parcel faces upon a dedicated street and was a "lot of record" prior to the effective date of the original subdivision regulations [Ordinance Number 510, Adopted June 22, 1971] of the City of Farmington in which event, a building permit conforming to all the requirements of this UDC may be issued without first complying with subsection 6.3A., platted subdivisions (see also section 9.4, nonconforming lots of record). 
Commentary: Electrical affidavits may be acceptable to demonstrate "lot of record" status, subject to the determination of the community development director.  
Sec. 6.4 - Subdivision design standards. 
    6.4.1 General. The city shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public, the site is not suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed. Land deemed to be environmentally unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, or for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life, or property, or aggravate erosion or flood hazard. Such land within the plat shall be restricted for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions. 
    6.4.2 Subdivision classes. For purposes of this section, the following subdivision classes are established: 
A.  Class 1 subdivisions are subdivisions in which the smallest lot has an area of less than 20,000 square feet and a width of less than 100 feet at the building line. 
B.  Class 2 subdivisions are subdivisions in which the smallest lot has an area of 20,000 square feet or more and a width of 100 feet or more at the building line. 
C.  Class 3 subdivisions are subdivisions in which the smallest lot has an area of one acre and a width of 150 feet or more at the building line. 
    6.4.3 Engineering and construction standards. 
A.  All required improvements, including but not limited to streets, sidewalks, trails and accessways, water and sewer, and drainage facilities, shall be designed by a licensed engineer registered in New Mexico in accordance with the requirements of the most recent City of Farmington "Design & Construction Standards with Technical Specification." 
B.  All required improvements, including but not limited to streets, sidewalks, trails and accessways, water and sewer, and drainage facilities, shall be constructed in accordance with the most recent City of Farmington "Design & Construction Standards with Technical Specification." 
C.  All streets, water, sewer, and drainage facilities shall be designed and constructed to, and through, the property in question in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
D.  Where city standards do not specifically cover a design or construction issue, the director may enforce other recognized industry standards. 
    6.4.4 Blocks. 
A.  Block length shall be at least 400 feet and shall not exceed 1,200 feet in single-family residential areas and shall not exceed 800 feet in other areas. In blocks over 800 feet in length, and at the end of cul-de-sacs that abut an existing or future school, park, greenway, trail, bikeway or street, may be required an accessway in accordance with the requirements of subsection 6.4.8B. 
B.  Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of a minimum depth of 100 feet, except where single tier lots are required to separate residential development from arterial traffic, to separate lots from an incompatible use, to allow for unusual topographic conditions or when adjacent to the outer perimeter of the subdivision. (See also subsection 6.4.5B., double-frontage lots). 
    6.4.5 Lots. 
A.  Arrangement. 
(1)  Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
(2)  Each lot must front upon a public street with a right-of-way width of not less than 50 feet, or a private street within an approved PUD with a right-of-way width of not less than 40 feet. 
(3)  Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets. 
(4)  Lot arrangement must be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the standards of this UDC. 
B.  Double-frontage lots (through lots). Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from thoroughfares or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. (See also the minimum lot depth requirements of subsection 6.4.4B.) 
C.  Flag or panhandle lots. Flag shaped or panhandle shaped lots may be created in any zone if all of the following requirements are met: 

(1)  The lot has at least 24 feet of frontage on a dedicated public or private street, which frontage serves as access only to the subject lot or parcel; 
(2)  The flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot shall be at least 24 feet in width for its entire length; 
(3)  The depth of the flagpole or panhandle shall not exceed 150 feet as measured from the adjacent public or private street right-of-way; and 
(4)  The flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot shall not be included in calculating minimum lot area. 
    6.4.6 Subdivision access. 
A.  Large tracts or parcels. When land is subdivided into larger parcels (further subdividable parcels) rather than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further subdivisions. If the comprehensive plan of the city requires thoroughfares to cross the subdivision, the right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public. 
B.  Required subdivision access points. 
(1)  A subdivision of 49 lots or less may provide access to the existing public roadway system via a single access point; however, two access points may be required where feasible. 
(2)  A subdivision of 50 lots or greater shall provide access to the existing or proposed public roadway system via two access points at minimum unless extreme natural conditions, as determined by the director, make such connection infeasible. 
(3)  Subdivisions of 250 lots or greater shall be required to provide three or more access points to the existing or proposed public roadway system, subject to review by the director. The third and additional access points shall be shown on the plat and construction plans for the development; however, construction of the street may be postponed to a later phase of development. The city may require the construction of any access point at the time of approval of the final plat. The timing, or "trigger," for construction of the third access point shall be established as part of the subdivision review process (final plat). 
    6.4.7 Streets and alleys. All streets and alleys within a subdivision must meet the following minimum standards: 
A.  Street layout. Adequate streets shall be provided by the subdivider so that the arrangement, character, extent, width and grade of each shall conform to the major thoroughfare plan or to requirements of subsection 6.4.7J., geometric standards-street design criteria, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to the topographical conditions, to the public safety and convenience and to their appropriate relationship to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets. 
B.  Relation to adjoining street systems. Where necessary to conform to the neighborhood pattern, existing streets in adjacent or adjoining areas shall be continued in the new development, in alignment therewith. Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section, the right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. 
C.  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. 
D.  Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and where the director finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of a street when the adjoining property is subdivided. 
E.  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be no more than 600 feet long unless otherwise necessitated by topography. Temporary turnarounds shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet. Such temporary turnarounds shall be required where the street stub exceeds one lot or 100 feet in length, whichever is greater. The developer shall provide a sign at the dead-end declaring that the particular street shall connect with any future development. 
F.  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600 feet in length to beginning of the cul-de-sac radius, and shall terminate in a turnaround with a minimum right-of-way diameter of 90 feet, and with a minimum outside edge-of-pavement radius of 40 feet exclusive of curbs. 
G.  Street intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible. No intersection shall be at an angle of less then 60 degrees. 
H.  Thoroughfares per comprehensive plan. Where a subdivision embraces, contains or abuts a thoroughfare(s) as shown on the major thoroughfare plan, such street(s) shall be platted to maintain continuity in the approximate location as shown, and of the type indicated. In certain cases, the city may have constructed a street through the area to be subdivided, in which case, the subdivider shall develop the necessary street intersections at his expense in accordance with the requirements of this section. The planning and zoning commission may require that, where practicable, residential lots adjacent to a thoroughfare be platted or restricted so as to prevent driveways opening into such streets. 
I.  Local streets. Local streets (streets not shown on major thoroughfare plan) shall be laid out to discourage their use for through traffic. 
J.  Geometric standards-Street design criteria. Minimum design criteria for streets are shown in the following table: 
Thoroughfares Local Streets Frontage Roads (3) Alleys Criteria Principal Arterials Minor

For streets with shoulders, the pavement width does not include the shoulder width. (3) Frontage roads may be approved parallel and adjacent to thoroughfares. (4) No sidewalks are required on residential streets approved pursuant to section 6.5, rural residential subdivisions, which are wholly contained within the subdivision.  
K.  Pavement widths. Pavement widths may be reduced for development relative to the requirements of subsection 6.4.7J., geometric standards-street design criteria, as follows: 
(1)  Class 2 subdivisions. Pavement width may be reduced to 24 feet wide with eight-foot graveled shoulders and drainage ditches and culverts, where appropriate. 
(2)  Class 3 subdivisions. Pavement widths may be reduced to 24 feet wide with eight-foot graveled shoulders and drainage ditches and culverts, where appropriate; provided, however, that: 
a.  City council may waive the paving requirement in Class 3 subdivisions based on consideration of: 
(1)  Density and intensity of uses, and anticipated traffic volumes to be generated by the subdivision; 
(2)  The location of the subdivision in relation to paved roadways; 
(3)  The rate of growth of the area in which the subdivision is to be located; 
(4)  The amount of traffic upon streets located within the subdivision created by surrounding land uses; and 
(5)  The presence or absence of soil conditions, drainage problems, unusual topography or similar physical land characteristics that may adversely affect the cost or difficulty of maintenance, or the safety, of unpaved streets if allowed within the subdivision. 
b.  City council may require as a condition of such waiver that the subdivider agree, on behalf of himself and his successors in title, to participate in an improvement district at such time as one is formed in the future for the purpose of assessing property owners with the cost of paving, and otherwise improving streets to applicable city standards. 
L.  Vertical curve. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in rates of grade for thoroughfares and 1/2 this minimum length for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one-inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one-inch equals ten feet vertical, shall be required by the director where topographic conditions warrant. 
M.  Additional width of existing streets. Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way if necessary to meet the minimum street width requirements set forth in this section, as follows: 
(1)  The entire additional right-of-way shall be provided where the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street. 
(2)  When the subdivision is located on only one side of existing street, one-half of the required additional rights-of-way shall be provided. In no case shall the resulting right-of-way width be less than 50 feet. 
N.  Restriction of access to arterials. When a subdivision or portion thereof adjoins a principal or minor arterial, no lot shall have direct access thereto. Such lots shall be provided with frontage on a frontage road or other street with adequate depth for screening of the portion of any such lot contiguous with an arterial in accordance with the requirements of section 5.5.7, screening standards. 
O.  Street names. Street names may not duplicate names of any existing street in the city or within the city's planning and platting jurisdiction (PPJ), except where the street is a continuation of an existing street, in accordance with the City of Farmington Street Naming and Numbering Policy. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the director. 
P.  Alleys. 
(1)  Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots intended to be used for nonresidential purposes and may be provided in residential areas, particularly in areas where alleys are part of the traditional neighborhood pattern. 
(2)  Dead-end alleys shall not be allowed. 
(3)  Alleys shall be graded to their maximum usable width to a grade approved by the city engineer. 
    6.4.8 Pedestrian, biking and multi-use facilities. 
A.  General. The purpose of these standards is to promote the design of an urban environment that is built to human scale, to provide for the safe movement of pedestrians and bicyclists, to promote the more efficient utilization of public infrastructure, and to foster attractive street fronts and pedestrian environments, while accommodating vehicular movement and alternate transportation modes with bicycle and pedestrian access. To these ends, bicycle and pedestrian facilities designed in accordance with AASHTO standards and the requirements of this section shall be included in site plans and subdivision layouts and designed to reduce conflicts between motor vehicles and pedestrians or bicyclists. The standards of this subsection are further intended to implement to the bikeway plan (figure 6.6) of the comprehensive plan. 
B.  Sizes of blocks. Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in length measured along the greatest dimension of the enclosed block area. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the planning and zoning commission may require one or more public crosswalks of right-of-way not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block and at locations deemed necessary at intervals not closer than 400 feet. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of a minimum depth of 100 feet. 
C.  Sidewalks. 
(1)  When required. 
a.  Sidewalks, designated crosswalks, safety islands are required on all streets, whether adjacent to or part of the subdivision, both private and public in nonresidential and all multifamily districts. 
b.  Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of local streets adjacent to building sites where the smallest lot has an area of less than 20,000 square feet and a width of less than 100 feet at the building line (Class 1 subdivisions). 
(2)  Sidewalk placement alternatives. The subdivider shall provide sidewalks within the rights-of-way in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, subject to the approval of the director. Sidewalks may be placed so as to maintain a minimum three-foot buffer/green space between the back of vertical curb and the inside edge of the sidewalk, or be placed against the back of a vertical curb. In either case, sidewalks shall be paved with a minimum unobstructed width of: 
a.  Five feet, along collectors and arterials; 
b.  Five feet, within nonresidential developments; and 
c.  Four feet, in all other locations. 
Commentary: Given that a combination or variation from the three placement alternatives is necessary or desired or that an obstruction is located within the paved area, all such transition sections must be approved by the administrator.  
D.  Bikeways and multi-use facilities. Bikeways and multi-use facilities shall be provided as follows where recommended by the bikeway plan or other adopted plans: 
(1)  Multi-use trails. A facility completely separated from auto traffic and within an independent right-of-way or within the right-of-way of another facility. Multi-use trails accommodate both biking and walking and are therefore wider in accordance with the requirements of subsection 6.4.8D(4), easements/treadways, to improve safety. 
(2)  Bike lanes. A facility where both sides of the roadway or shoulder are striped, signed, and marked for exclusive or preferential bicycle use and where vehicle parking is not permitted, unless otherwise specified. The minimum bike lane width shall be six feet for bike lanes with curb and five feet, without curb. 
(3)  Bike routes. A facility designated by signing to help make motorists aware of the presence of bicycles, which share the right-of-way with motor vehicles. 
(4)  Easements/treadways. Multi-use trails, where required, shall have a minimum 15-foot right-of-way or easement, for bicycle and pedestrian uses dedicated to the public. A ten-foot treadway shall be constructed in the center of the right-of-way or easement conforming to the city standards, unless modified or waived by the city council. 
(5)  Bikeway location criteria. Bikeways shall be located to integrate with the existing and future city street and park system in accordance with the bikeway plan (see figure 6.6 of the comprehensive plan). Additionally, criteria to be used in determining facility types and locations may be based on the following considerations: 
a.  Safety in terms of existing street width; 
b.  Existing and potential demand for use; 
c.  Continuity, directness, and linkages to activity centers; 
d.  Spacing in relation to other bikeway facilities; 
e.  Location of schools and other public facilities frequented by bicycle riders; and 
f.  Location of linear parks and greenbelts. 
E.  Timing of dedication and construction. 
(1)  All accessways, bikeways and multi-use facilities, as may be required by this UDC or recommended by the bikeway plan or other adopted plans, or as may be negotiated through the platting process, shall be dedicated and constructed prior to release of the subdivision guarantee, or as required below: 
a.  All required accessways, sidewalks, bikeways and multi-use facilities must be constructed concurrently with the adjacent street or thoroughfare; 
b.  If the street or thoroughfare is already constructed, prior to acceptance of any improvements. 
(2)  All sidewalks as may be required by this UDC, or as may be negotiated through the platting process, shall be dedicated, and constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
    6.4.9 Monuments. 
A.  Location. Subdividers shall place permanent reference monuments at block corners, control points, and lot corners. A permanent benchmark with elevation on NAVD 88 must be set. 
B.  Material specifications. 
(1)  Corner and control point monuments must be Iron #4 rebar with cap set in concrete. 
(2)  Lot corner monuments must be iron pins set in the ground. 
(3)  Permanent benchmark is a 21/2-inch brass or aluminum cap set in concrete. 
    6.4.10 Easements. 
A.  Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, natural channel or stream, there may be required a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially to the limits of such watercourse. Additional width may be required to accommodate future needs as determined by the director. No construction shall impede, constrict, or block the flow of water in any easement or natural watercourse, except in accordance with section 6.4.14. Drainage easements may not be used for utilities unless specifically approved by the city engineer. Such easements shall not straddle lot lines, but must be wholly contained within a lot(s). 
No fencing shall be allowed within a drainage easement, except: 
(1)  Along the boundary of such easement, approximately parallel to the anticipated flow; and 
(2)  Where designed to maintain the stormwater flow and specifically approved by the city engineer. 
B.  Utility easements. Utility easements shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of subsection 5.3.1A. 
    6.4.11 Water supply. All subdivisions shall be provided with water supply and distribution systems for fire protection and domestic use either by the City of Farmington or a water supply district in accordance with the City of Farmington's Water Service Policy and the requirements of this section. Water system design shall be approved and enforced by the director in accordance with applicable city, state and federal statutes, codes, City of Farmington construction specifications, and acceptable engineering practice. 
A.  Class 1 subdivisions. The subdivider shall make necessary arrangements to serve each lot with a water main of the Farmington water system. 
B.  Class 2 and Class 3 subdivisions. The subdivider shall provide an adequate supply of potable water to each lot by a water system approved by the New Mexico Environmental Department, or shall serve each lot with a water main of the Farmington water system; or where it is feasible and practical for an adequate water supply to be made available for every lot by the individual lot owner to present evidence to this effect and include deed restrictions on the final plat requiring any such individual water systems to comply with the requirements of the New Mexico Environmental Department. 
    6.4.12 Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants and control valves shall be installed not more than 500 feet apart at proper locations to be determined by the director, in consultation with the fire marshall or his designee. All fire hydrants shall have two 21/2-inch hose connections, and one 41/2-inch steamer connection or two 41/2-inch steamer connections for hydrants on 12 inches and larger water mains. 
    6.4.13 Sanitary sewer. 
A.  Class 1 subdivisions. All subdivision lots shall have city sewer service. 
B.  Class 2 subdivisions. Where a public sanitary sewer is within 600 feet of the subdivision and accessible by either gravity or an individual pressure sewer system, the subdivider shall connect with the public sanitary sewer system and provide adequate sewer lines accessible to each lot. Where lots cannot be connected with a public sewer system, provisions must be made for sanitary sewerage facilities, consisting of a central treatment plant or individual disposal devices for each lot, but the subdivision plat shall include deed restrictions requiring that all such disposal systems shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the New Mexico Environmental Department and under the supervision of and subject to the approval of the city engineer. 
C.  Class 3 subdivisions. Where a public sanitary sewer is within 300 feet of the subdivision and accessible by either gravity or an individual pressure sewer system, the subdivider shall connect with the public sanitary sewer system and provide adequate sewer lines accessible to each lot. Where lots cannot be connected with a public sewer system, provisions must be made for sanitary sewerage facilities, consisting of a central treatment plant or individual disposal devices for each lot, but the subdivision plat shall include deed restrictions requiring that all such disposal systems shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the New Mexico Environmental Department and under the supervision of and subject to the approval of the city engineer. 
    6.4.14 Drainage. 
A.  Drainage facilities shall be provided to handle runoff as calculated, street inlets for a 25-year storm; sewers for a 25-year storm, 24-hour storm; and bridges for a 100-year storm, all as approved by the director. Water shall not be carried on the street for a distance greater than a ten-year storm will overflow the curb. 
Commentary: This section should not be interpreted to prohibit detention facilities approved by the city engineer within natural or improved watercourses.  
B.  Drainage shall be handled in natural watercourses and stream channels insofar as practical. No lot shall be platted and no construction permitted that impedes, constricts, or blocks the flow of water in any natural or improved watercourse; provided, however, in Class 2 and Class 3 subdivisions, drainage may be by open channels located preferably along the streets or when drainage easements are provided, along rear lot lines. 
C.  Drainage improvements shall prevent the collection of water in any low spot except where such collection occurs in an improved stormwater retention basin or area. 
D.  Stormwater drainage shall not be permitted to combine with sanitary sewers or irrigation ditches. 
    6.4.15 Underground utilities. 
A.  All new utility service and distribution facilities in new subdivisions, including electrical, telephone, and cable television facilities, shall be installed underground; provided, however, that the City of Farmington Electric Utility Department reserves the right to provide overhead service from existing power lines or to install overhead power lines due to terrain, design criteria, or other unforeseen problems [Resolution Number 91-656, January 22, 1991]. 
B.  Electric utility installations shall be in accordance with City of Farmington Electric Utility Rule and Regulation Number 16, as periodically amended. A line extension agreement is required. 
(1)  Residential underground, as referred to by the City of Farmington Electric Utility, is a single phase primary system complete with pad-mounted transformers designed to reduce the primary system voltage to the standard usable residential voltage of 120/240 volts three wire single phase, plus the three wire electric service to the meter location on the house. 
(2)  To obtain an electrical estimate and the installation of the electrical system in (residential or nonresidential) subdivisions, applicants shall provide a digital, scaled site plan in the most recent AutoCAD format (or other format as directed by the city electric department) to include the following information: 
a.  Boundary lines of the subject property;

As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
E.  Upon consideration of the factors noted in subsections A. through F. of this section and the intent of this section, the ARB may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this section. 
F.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
G.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
H.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and upon: 
(1)  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(5)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria outlined in subsections A. through G. of this section are met and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

The ARB shall be authorized to grant a variance from the terms hereof if they find that the strict enforcement of this UDC would create a substantial hardship to the applicant by virtue of unique special conditions not generally found within the vicinity, and that the granting of the variance would preserve the spirit and intent of the UDC, and would serve the general interests of the public and the applicant. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this UDC so that public health, safety, and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done.

F.  Notice of decision. Written notice of the decision to approve or approve with conditions, or deny shall be provided to the applicant within five working days of the decision, and a copy shall be filed in the office of the director. 
    8.12.4 Variance criteria. 
A.  Required findings. A variance may be granted only where a literal enforcement of the Code provisions would result in unnecessary hardship for a particular property. In order to grant a variance, the ARB must make a positive finding of fact concerning each of the following or, if a positive finding of fact cannot be made that the ARB specifically describes the circumstance that would outweigh the strict requirement for a positive finding of fact and determine that the variance will not be a public detriment: 
(1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist, which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district; and; furthermore, that they are not self-imposed, self-created or otherwise the result of actions by the applicant; 
(2)  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of the Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of the Code; 
(3)  The applicant demonstrates that the request is a minimum easing of the Code requirements, making possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; 
(4)  That the granting of the variance is in harmony with the general interest, the general purpose and intent of the Code, and is not injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; 
(5)  That the proposed variance will not permit a use not otherwise allowed in the underlying district; 
(6)  That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts has been or shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance; and 
(7)  That the applicant would suffer an unnecessary hardship if the variance requested were denied. 
B.  Approval limitations. The ARB may not approve a variance that creates any of the following situations: 
(1)  The establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in the applicable zoning district; 
(2)  An increase in the density of a use in excess of the density permitted by the applicable district; or 
(3)  A change in the zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning map. 
    8.12.5 Appeals. Appeals of any final decision regarding a variance shall be made to the city council within 15 days of the decision in accordance with section 8.16, appeals of ARB decisions. 
Sec. 8.13 - Administrative adjustments. 
    8.13.1 Purposes. Administrative adjustments are minor variances, up to a maximum of ten percent, from otherwise applicable development standards where development is proposed that would be: 
A.  Compatible with surrounding land uses; 
B.  Harmonious with the public interest; and 
C.  Consistent with the purposes of this UDC. 
Commentary: Administrative adjustments should not be approved in every case. Rather, the administrator should strictly limit approvals to those situations that clearly satisfy all of the criteria. In making the decision to approve or disapprove administrative adjustments, the director should consider any special efforts by the applicant to promote compatibility with neighboring properties, such as the installation of walls or fences, additional landscaping, or other site plan trade-offs.  
    8.13.2 Applicability. 
A.  The director may authorize adjustment of up to ten percent from any numerical standard related to height, bulk, setback or other site plan related standards. Any adjustment request greater than ten percent shall be treated as a variance handled by the ARB subject to the requirements of section 8.12, variances. 
B.  The director may authorize alternative parking plans in accordance with the requirements of section 5.2.7. 
C.  The limitations of subsection 8.13.2A. notwithstanding, the director may, but is not required to, waive or vary any requirement of the adopted access management plan, particularly, but not exclusively, when rigid adherence to the standards of said plan are not physically achievable by virtue of existing street or driveway location, or because of the existence of other conditions, that, in the opinion of the director make such rigid adherence impractical or unnecessary. It is the intent of this provision to maximize relief through administrative adjustment, thus reducing processing delays. 

    8.13.3 Administrative adjustment application process. 
A.  Application submittal. A complete application for an administrative adjustment shall be submitted to the director as set forth in section 8.1.3. 
B.  Review and final action by director. The director shall review the application and approve, approve with conditions or deny the application based upon the criteria below. 
C.  Notice of decision. Written notice of the decision to approve or approve with conditions, or deny shall be provided to the applicant within five working days of the decision, and a copy shall be filed in the office of the director. 
    8.13.4 Administrative adjustment criteria. To approve an application for an administrative adjustment, the director shall consider mitigation measures offered in support of the adjustment and the following criteria: 
A.  Granting the adjustment will ensure the same general level of land use compatibility as the otherwise applicable standards; 
B.  Granting the adjustment will not materially or adversely affect adjacent land uses and the physical character of uses in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development because of inadequate buffering, screening, setbacks and other land use considerations; 
C.  Granting the adjustment will be generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this UDC; and 
D.  Granting the adjustment will be based on the physical constraints and land use specifics, rather than on economic hardship of the applicant. 
    8.13.5 Action following a denial. Administrative adjustments may not be appealed to the ARB. In the event of a denial of an administrative adjustment, the applicant may apply for a variance in accordance with the requirements of section 8.12, variances. 
Sec. 8.14 - Written interpretations.

(2)  The use does not create excessive additional traffic in the neighborhood; and 
(3)  The use does not generate noise, smoke or other environmental pollutants that are foreign to the neighborhood. 
B.  In granting a special use permit for a nonconforming use, the city council may impose such conditions as reasonably necessary to promote harmony with adjacent permitted uses in the district. Such conditions may include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Requirement that standards for off-street parking be met; 
(2)  Requirement for physical improvements to the structure to make it compatible with neighboring properties;

It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence that the use for which the special use permit is sought lawfully existed prior to the adoption of the provision of the code which resulted in the use no longer being subject to the provisions of the Unified Development Code, section 9.2, nonconforming uses, but shall be subject to the general provisions pertaining to special uses and whatever conditions are attached to the special use permit. 
D.  This section applies to nonconforming uses of structures and shall not be construed to apply to nonconforming lots, nonconforming structures or nonconforming uses of unimproved land.

The dwelling shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard on each side of the dwelling. 
    9.4.2 Other uses of nonconforming lots: Site plan required. 
In any district in which single-family dwellings are not permitted, a nonconforming lot of record, which meets the requirements above, may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is located if, but only if, a site plan for such use has been approved in accordance with the provisions of section 8.5, site plan review.

TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS (TIA) 
CITY OF FARMINGTON PROPOSED REQUIREMENTS 
(Jan. 2006) 
    13.4.1 Traffic impact analysis (TIA). Traffic impacts study (TIA) that determines the potential traffic impacts of a proposed traffic generator. A complete analysis will include an estimation of future traffic with and without the proposed generator, analysis of the traffic impacts, and recommended roadway improvements that may be necessary to accommodate the expected traffic. 
A.  Purpose. This standard provides uniform guidelines for conducting traffic impact analyses for proposed development with access to an arterial or a collector street. 
B.  Applicability. The community development director or designee shall determine applicability based on the following factors and considerations: 
(1)  A traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be prepared for proposed developments, or additions to existing developments, that generate more than 100 vehicle trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour period. The city shall make the final determination regarding TIA requirements and applicable category, and the impact analysis shall be in a format as described in the appendix. The criteria for each TIA category are as follows: 
a.  Category 1. 
(1)  Developments that generate between 100 to 500 trips, during the morning or afternoon peak hour; or 
(2)  Existing traffic situations or concerns in the local area such as, but not limited to, an offset intersection or a high number of traffic accidents; or 
(3)  Sensitivity of the adjacent neighborhoods or other areas where the public may perceive an adverse impact; or 
(4)  Proximity of site driveways to other driveways or intersection; or 
(5)  Specific problems or concerns that may be aggravated by the proposed development. 
b.  Category 2. Developments that generate 501 to 1,000 total trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour. 
c.  Category 3. Developments that generate more than 1,000 trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour. 
(2)  In addition to the above requirement thresholds, the community development department may require a TIA when changes in land use, traffic, and roadways occur, such as: 
a.  Proposed property rezoning; or 
b.  When the original TIA is more than three years old; or 
c.  Where the projected traffic volumes increase by more than ten percent. 
    13.4.2 Engineering qualifications. The TIA shall be prepared under the direction of a professional engineer (civil) licensed to practice in the State of New Mexico with specific experience in traffic engineering and the preparation of TIA reports. 
A.  TIA process. 
(1)  Initial evaluation. Prior to beginning the TIA, the applicant shall contact the traffic engineering division to discuss the scope of work, methodology, and level of detail required for the specific project. Following the initial meeting, the applicant shall provide an estimate of the number of vehicular trips generated by the proposed development. The estimate must be prepared using a city-approved methodology and shall be submitted to the city for review and approval. The developer may request that the city assist in estimating the number of trips. 
(2)  Draft outline. Following the initial evaluation, the city shall make a final determination regarding the need for a TIA and identify the applicable category. If a TIA is required, the applicant shall prepare a draft table of contents and project outline for submittal to the city. The outline will identify the proposed area of influence for the study, all intersection and roadways to be analyzed, and level of detail and methodology for gathering traffic volume information and preparation of level of service analyses. The draft shall also include a proposed trip distribution for site traffic. Following city review and approval the final TIA may be prepared. 
(3)  Scope of work. The TIA scope of work agreement between engineer and developer shall conform to the pre-approved draft table of contents and outline. The findings, conclusions and recommendations contained within the TIA document shall be prepared in accordance with appropriate professional civil engineering practices. (See appendix for traffic impact analysis format.) 
B.  Analytical methodology. The procedures outlined in this policy provide the minimum requirements for a TIA, although the city reserves the right to require additional information. The TIA approach and methods shall be guided by the following criteria: 
(1)  Study area and timeframe. The minimum study area and timeframe for projected analysis shall be determined by project type and size, in accordance with the criteria previously outlined. The study area or projected timeframe may be amended by the city as necessary. 
a.  Category 1. The minimum study area shall include all site access drives and adjacent signalized intersection and/or major unsignalized street intersection. The study's projected timeframe shall be one year from receipt of certificate of occupancy. 
b.  Category 2. The minimum study area shall include all site access drives and all signalized intersection and/or major unsignalized street intersection within one-half mile of the development. The study's projected timeframe shall include the first year following receipt of certificate of occupancy and the five succeeding years. 
c.  Category 3. The minimum study area shall include all site access drives and all signalized intersection and/or major unsignalized street intersection within one-half mile of the development. The study's projected timeframe shall include the opening year of the development, five years after opening and ten years after opening. 
(2)  Peak hour analysis. Both the morning (7 a.m. to 9 a.m.) and evening (4 p.m. to 6 p.m.) weekday peak hours shall be analyzed, unless the proposed project is expected to generate no trips, or a very low number of trips, during either peak hours. When a project's traffic generation patterns differ significantly from established patterns or when the peak traffic hours occur during a different time, all additional peak hours shall be analyzed. 
(3)  Seasonal adjustments. When directed by city, in cases where seasonal traffic data is available, the traffic volumes for the analysis hours shall be adjusted for the peak season. 
(4)  Data collection requirements. All data shall be collected in accordance with procedures outlined in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Manual of Traffic Engineering Studies, or as otherwise directed by city. At a minimum, the following data shall be collected: 
a.  Turning movement counts. Manual turning movement counts shall be obtained for all existing cross-street intersection to be analyzed during the morning and afternoon peak periods. Turning movement counts may be required during other periods as directed by the city. 
b.  Daily traffic volumes. The current and projected daily traffic volumes shall be presented in the report. If available, daily count data from the city may be extrapolated a maximum of three years with the concurrence of the city. Where daily count data is not available, mechanical counts will be required at locations agreed upon by the city. 
c.  Collision data. Collision data shall be obtained for the most current three-year period available. 
2.  Roadway and intersection. Geometrics Roadway geometric information shall be obtained. This includes, but is not limited to, roadway width, number of lanes, turning lanes, vertical grade, location of nearby driveways, and lane configuration at intersection. 
3.  Traffic control devices. The location and type of traffic controls shall be identified. 
C.  Trip generation. 
1.  The latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual shall be used to identify trip generation rates. In cases where Trip Generation does not include trip rates for a specific land use category, includes only limited data; or, where local trip rates have been shown to differ from the ITE rates, other rates may be used with the approval of the city. 
2.  A trip generation table shall be prepared showing proposed land use, trip rates, and vehicle trips for daily and peak hour periods and appropriate traffic volume adjustments, if applicable. Site traffic generation shall be shown for daily, morning and evening peak hour periods. Adjustments made for "passer-by" and "mixed-use" traffic volumes shall follow the methodology outlined in the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook. The "passer-by" traffic volume discount for commercial centers shall not exceed 25 percent unless approved by the city. 
D.  Trip distribution and assignment. 
1.  Projected trip volume shall be distributed and added to the projected non-site traffic on the roadways and intersection(s) in the study area. The specific assumptions and data sources used in deriving trip distribution and assignment shall be documented in the report. 
2.  Future traffic volumes shall be estimated using information from transportation models, or applying an annual growth rate to the base-line traffic volumes. The future traffic volumes shall correlate to the project's specific timeframe. If the annual growth rate method is used, the city must give prior approval to the percentage used. 
3.  In addition, any nearby proposed or approved development projects shall be taken into consideration when forecasting future traffic volumes. The increase in traffic from proposed and approved developments, the application of an annual growth rate, or a combination of an annual growth rate and proposed and approved developments, shall be used to forecast the future traffic volumes. 
4.  The site-generated traffic shall be assigned to the street network in the study area based on the approved trip distribution percentages. The site traffic shall be combined with the forecast traffic volumes to show the total traffic conditions estimated at development completion. The total daily and peak period turning movement volumes for each traffic study intersection is required. In addition, the base-line volume with site-generated traffic added to the street network must also be shown. This amount will represent site-specific traffic impacts on existing conditions 
E.  Internal circulation. 
1.  Parking lot/on-site traffic circulation shall be in conformance with standards of practice as set forth by "Transportation and Land Development" (ITE, current edition). 
    13.4.3 Project analyses. 
A.  Capacity analysis. 
1.  Level of service (LOS) shall be computed for signalized and unsignalized intersection in accordance with procedures contained in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual. 
2.  The intersection LOS shall be calculated for each of the following conditions (if applicable): 
a.  Existing peak hour traffic volumes ("figure" required); 
b.  Existing peak hour traffic volumes including site-generated traffic ("figure" required); 
c.  Future traffic volumes not including site traffic ("figure" required); 
d.  Future traffic volumes including site traffic ("figure" required); and 
e.  LOS results for each traffic volume scenario ("table" required). 
3.  The LOS table shall include LOS results for all peak periods analyzed. The table shall show LOS conditions with corresponding vehicle delays for signalized intersection, and LOS conditions for the critical movements at unsignalized intersection. For signalized intersection, the LOS conditions and average vehicle delay shall be provided for each approach and the intersection as a whole. 
4.  Unless otherwise directed by the city, the capacity analysis for existing signalized intersection shall be conducted using the Highway Capacity Manual Planning Method for each study horizon year. 
B.  Operational analysis method. When directed by city, the capacity analysis shall be conducted using the Operational Analysis Method. If an operational capacity analysis method is used for existing signalized intersection, it shall include existing phasing, timing, splits, and cycle lengths as observed and measured during the peak traffic periods. For unsignalized intersection, the Highway Capacity Manual methodology shall be used. 
C.  Phased projects. Where new development is to be completed in phases, the TIA shall, if directed by city, include an LOS analysis for each separate development phase in addition to the TIA for the overall project timeframe. The incremental increases in site traffic from each phase shall be included in the LOS analysis for each preceding year of development completion. A "figure" will be required for each horizon year of phased development. 
D.  Traffic signal analysis. Traffic signal needs studies (warrant analysis) shall be conducted for all proposed signals for the base year. If the warrants are not met for the base year, they shall be evaluated for each year in the five-year horizon. Traffic signal needs studies shall be conducted by a method pre-approved by the city. 
E.  Collision analysis. An analysis of three-year collision data shall be conducted to determine if the level of safety will deteriorate due to the addition of site traffic. 
F.  Vehicle speed parameters. Vehicle speed is used to estimate safe stopping and cross corner sight distances. The posted speed limit is representative of the 85th percentile speed and may be used to calculate safe stopping and cross corner sight distances, unless directed otherwise by the city. 
G.  Pedestrian and biking analysis. The pedestrian and bike facilities, or lack thereof, within the study area shall be analyzed, with and without the proposed development, to identify any projected impacts on their use and safety. Pedestrian and bike use and safety within the study area shall not be unreasonably reduced, with the overall objective being to enhance rather than reduce biking and walking activities. 
H.  Roadway improvement analysis. The roadways and intersections within the study area shall be analyzed, with and without the proposed development, to identify any projected impacts on both level of service and safety. Where the highway will operate at level of service "C" or better without the development, the traffic impact of the development on the roadways and intersection within the study area shall be mitigated to level of service "C". Mitigation to level of service "D" may be acceptable with city approval. Particular attention shall be directed to potential need for separate right turn or left turn lanes. A section of the TIA shall provide discussion regarding this requirement. 
I.  On-site circulation analysis. The TIA shall include an analysis of the adequacy of the on-site circulation plan.

Sec. 13.5 - Landscape guidelines for Farmington. 
    13.5.1 Landscape guidelines for Farmington. The natural landscape of Farmington is a high desert environment. There are two dominant native plant communities in Farmington, Piñon Juniper Woodland and Riparian Corridors. The Piñon Juniper Woodland occurs in the higher elevations, towards the northern part of town, and the Riparian Corridor occurs along the river corridor of the valley floor. 
    The limited amount of annual rainfall (eight inches-ten inches) received in Farmington means that most plants require some level of supplemental water. Landscapers are encouraged to use plants that are adapted to our environment (indigenous or native to similar climates of the world) and require low amounts of water. Given the characteristics of Farmington's natural environment, xeriscaping, or the use of water-efficient landscaping, is the most appropriate form of landscape design in a low-precipitation, high desert environment. 
    A xeriscape is not a "zero-scape." Xeriscaping emphasizes the use of plants adapted to dry conditions and is neither a barren nor a maintenance free landscape. Plants utilized in xeriscaping tend to be xeric, meaning that they require little supplemental water. (Xeros is Greek for dry.) 
    Xeriscaping utilizes several design principles to ensure that the created landscapes are suitable for the local climate and are water efficient. The principles applied in xeriscaping are good horticultural practices for our desert environment. The seven xeriscape principles are: 
1.  Planning and design; 
2.  Efficient irrigation systems; 
3.  Use of mulch; 
4.  Soil preparation; 
5.  Appropriate turf; 
6.  Water-efficient plant material; and 
7.  Appropriate maintenance. 
    13.5.2 1. Planning and design. A good xeriscape landscape begins with good design and initial planning. Before you put the shovel to the ground, it is important to have a landscape plan. When creating a landscape plan, consider the physical characteristics of the site. 
1.  What kind of soil is found on-site? Is it rocky, sandy, or made up of clays? 
2.  What is the topography and how does the area drain? Is it flat or sloped? Are there natural drainages? 
3.  Is there any existing vegetation or is it a vacant lot? 
4.  What functions is the landscaping to serve? Will it be used as a play area, provide shade, or screen views? 
    Once the site and function of the landscaping is considered, select the right plant for the right place. When choosing plants, consider: 
1.  Sun versus shade requirements. 
2.  Height and spread of plant materials at maturity. 
3.  The plant's function in the landscape, i.e. will it screen views or shade areas. 
    Also consider whether the desired plant has strong allergens or is an invasive species. Plants that have strong allergens should be used with caution. Several species of juniper are considered highly allergic. It is against the Farmington City Code (FCC) to plant the cotton bearing Cottonwood (FCC § 12-6-3). Seedless varieties are acceptable to plant. Russian olive and Salt Cedar are invasive species that have overpopulated areas along Farmington's river corridor. Invasive species out-compete native plant species, alter habitat, and affect ecosystem functions. Therefore, invasive species, such as Russian Olive and Salt Cedar, are discouraged as landscape plants. 
    Plants with thorns or stickers, such as pyracantha, are effective barrier plants but should not be used in areas of high traffic. 
    Do not plant trees under power lines, where branches will conflict with the lines. 
    Before you dig, verify all underground utility locations. 
    Group plants with similar water needs by dividing the landscape into zones of low, medium and high water uses (water zoning). 
A.  High water use zone. 
(1)  Typically these plants are the most colorful and have the greatest visual impact. 
(2)  Limit plantings to areas near the building by the entry or around a patio. 
(3)  Work's well on the northern and eastern sides of buildings where soils are moister or at runoff points, such as down spouts. 
B.  Medium water use zone. 
(1)  The transition zone or moderate water use areas should be planted farther away from the house or building. 
(2)  Require less frequent watering, i.e. once a week or less, and usually less maintenance. 
C.  Low water use zone. 
(1)  Typically located the farthest away from the building. 
(2)  Use plants that may require little or no supplemental water. 
(3)  Select natives and other plants requiring little or no water for the low water use zones. 
    To help save on water costs, water can be harvested from roof down spouts into barrels and/or directed through swales or drainage areas within the landscape. 
    13.5.3 2. Irrigation. Proper and efficient irrigation saves water. Irrigation is required, even for drought tolerant plants, during the establishment period and periods of severe drought. Points to remember when designing an irrigation system are: 
(1)  Separate water use zones for high, moderate and low water use plants. 
(2)  Design irrigation systems with separate valves for each water zone. 
(3)  Choose the appropriate type of sprinkler heads. Use spray heads for turf and bubblers, drip emitters, or micro-spray heads in shrub beds depending on the density of planting. 
(4)  Irrigation systems may be manual or automatic. An automatic irrigation system saves time and provides better control of watering times. 
    Maintaining the irrigation system is also important. Repair all breaks in lines and clogged heads. Re-program the irrigation controller as the seasons change. Adjust spray heads to avoid over-spraying onto walks and walls. Do not allow irrigation water to run-off the landscaped area. (For more detailed information on how to set up an irrigation system, please see the irrigation guidelines section of the appendix.) 
    13.5.4 3. Mulching. Mulch is a protective layer applied over soils and may be composed of organic or inorganic material. Mulch provides a cover over the soil, reduces evaporation, helps maintain constant soil temperatures, controls erosion, and limits weeds which compete for water and nutrients. 
A.  Organic mulches include bark, wood chips, cotton burr hulls, other nut shell byproducts, compost, grass clippings, and even newspaper. Organic mulches provide more than just the benefits mentioned above. They also improve soil conditions as they decompose, help keep soil structure loose, improve water infiltration, retain water, and allow for better root growth. 
B.  Inorganic mulches include rock cobble, gravel, or crusher fines and synthetics such as rubber pellets. Rock mulches radiate heat and are better suited for truly xeric plants. Placing rock mulches work best in locations removed from a building. Ultimately, plants in rock mulches will shade the ground and cool the environment. 
When using mulches: 
(1)  Apply a three-inch to four-inch thick layer of mulch to effectively reduce weeds and retain moisture. 
(2)  Avoid the use of organic mulch on slopes or high wind areas, as they will wash or blow away. 
(3)  Do not apply organic mulches in direct contact with plants. Leave at least two inches of unmulched area around the plant stem to prevent disease and pests. 
    Plastic weed barriers can be used in a limited fashion where the soil must be kept dry, such as at the foundation of a house. However, landscape fabric is preferred, as it is permeable and allows air and water to pass to the plant roots. 
    13.5.5 4. Soil preparation. A critical aspect of any gardening function is soil preparation. It is important to test the soil first to determine what plants are adaptable to your yard and what amendments are required to improve the soil. Farmington soils are virtually devoid of organic matter and are typically fast-draining, sandy soils. 
    The size of the planting hole and the backfill used is an important part in amending soils. All planting holes should be at least twice the width of the container; however three times the width is preferred. Digging wide planting holes loosens the soil, which allows air, water, and nutrients to reach the roots. 
    The backfill around the plant should be amended with composted materials such as peat moss, composted wood shavings or yard waste. Adding compost improves the moisture holding capacity in sandy soils and improves the porosity in clay soils. Over time, the compost breaks down and forms humus that improves the structure of the soil. Be sure to thoroughly mix the native soil and compost before adding to the planting hole. The amended soil mixture should include no more than 50 percent compost. Plants requiring high to moderate water will require the most compost materials. Native plants require less composted material in the backfill (15-30 percent by volume). 
    Turf areas should be rototilled to a depth of four to six inches and amended with two cubic yards of compost per 1,000 square feet. Limit rototilling to areas being planted as disturbed areas make it easier for weed seeds to germinate. 
    13.5.6 5. Appropriate use of turf. While it requires more water and maintenance, turf has a place in xeriscape. Turf provides a playing surface for kids and pets, is an important cooling element, and reduces erosion and sun glare. However, turf should only be planted in an appropriate amount to meet specific needs. If turf is not serving a functional purpose, there are other low spreading ground covers can be used to provide a carpet of green that require less water and maintenance. 
    Proper selection turf used is important. If you need a turf for heavy use and a long growing season, a fescue or fescue-bluegrass mix is preferred. If it is a lighter use turf (mostly in the summer months) a warm season grass such as buffalograss, blue grama, or Bermuda grass is suggested. 
    13.5.7 6. Low water use plants. The principal concept behind xeriscaping is the use of low water use plants. There is a misconception that drought tolerant plants are unattractive. The truth is that there are many attractive plants with a variety of flower and foliage colors, fruit, fall color, fragrance, with different sizes, shapes and uses. Low water use plants are becoming more available in nurseries. A list of perennials, vines, shrubs, and trees are included in these guidelines. Please visit your local nursery for other drought tolerant plants that are suitable for the Farmington area. 
    13.5.8 7. Maintenance. Maintenance in the garden is just good horticultural practice, with design dictating the level of maintenance. Although most xeriscapes require less maintenance, a xersicape garden can be as labor intensive as you want it to be. The design dictates the level of maintenance. There is no such thing as a maintenance free garden. Plants will always require water and fertilizer, pest and weed control, and pruning or deadheading.

Sec. 13.6 - Irrigation guidelines for the City of Farmington. 
    Due to the limited annual rainfall received by the City of Farmington, supplemental irrigation is required to maintain plants in a healthy condition. A properly designed automatic irrigation system provides efficient application of water to the landscape. Below are suggested irrigation guidelines. These guidelines should not supersede a consultation with a qualified landscaping professional in designing an irrigation system. 
    13.6.1 Irrigation system design basics. Irrigation systems are designed with hydraulics in mind. Hydraulic principles such as gallons per minute, pounds per square inch, friction loss, velocity, and proper coverage all factor into the design of an irrigation system. These principles will be explained, as the components of an irrigation system are discussed. 
    13.6.2 Water meters. Most property owners will have a single water meter to service their building and site. Irrigation lines that tie into the water service downstream of the water meter may require tying into a copper line, which requires a licensed plumber to sweat weld a copper tee and an adapter for the irrigation line. For large scale landscape projects, a separate "irrigation only" water meter may be installed to prevent a monthly sewer assessment fee. If the property has the right to use water from an irrigation ditch, installation of a water meter is not required. 
    If an existing water meter is in place, the volume of water, or gallons per minute (GPM), is determined by the size of the existing water meter. If a new meter is being installed, the designer determines the meter size, based on an acceptable loss of pressure through the meter. Generally, four to eight pounds of pressure or pounds per square inch (PSI) may be allowed for meter loss. Pressure loss above this amount will either place undo stress on the meter or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly. 
Loss of pressure occurs whenever water moves through a pipe or when water moves uphill against the force of gravity. If the total pressure in a piping system exceeds the available static water pressure the water will not flow.  
    To help determine the amount of pressure loss expected given a particular meter size and GPM refer to the table on the following page. 
Water Meter Size 
(Inches) Gallons Per Minute 
(GPM) Pressure Lost 
(PSI) 5/820 10 5/810 2.5 1 50 10 1 20 1.6 1 10 .4 Source: American Water Works Association  
    Pressure is lost as water flows through components of an irrigation system. The amount of water that can flow through an irrigation component is determined by the size of the component and its acceptable pressure loss. It is critical that a proper level of pressure is maintained to operate an irrigation system effectively. 
A.  Main lines. The main line is the supply line from the point of connection to the control valves. This portion of the line is under pressure at all times, with the exception of the winter months when the system should be shut off and drained. The main line is placed in the ground with a minimum of 18 inches of cover. Piping used for main lines should be a rigid, thick walled material, such as PVC (poly vinyl chloride) Schedule 40 or PVC Class 315. Main lines are sized based on acceptable friction loss, as recommended by the manufacturer. Pressure loss above the acceptable amount will either place undo stress on the main line or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly. 
Friction loss is based on the velocity of the water running through the main line. Velocity is calculated in feet per second (FPS). Typically, the velocity in a line should not exceed five FPS. Irrigation manufacturers provide friction loss charts to help you determine the proper size of line. Main lines may be upsized to reduce the amount of pressure loss, if low pressure is a concern. 
Friction loss is the loss of pressure caused by turbulence created in the water shile traveling through a pipe.  
B.  Backflow devices. Once an irrigation connection has been made, a backflow device must be installed per Unified Plumbing Code standards. Contact the city's plumbing inspector to discuss the proper backflow device to be installed for your landscape. Backflow devices are sized based on an acceptable pressure loss, per the manufacturer's literature. 
Backflow is a reverse flow condition, created by a drop in pressure in a distribution line, which causes water to flow backwards into the distribution source.  
Smaller irrigation systems may use an atmospheric vacuum breaker (one per valve), placed 6" above the highest head. For larger irrigation systems, a single backflow device may be installed, such as a pressure vacuum breaker, a double check valve or a reduced pressure device. A pressure vacuum device is installed 6" above the highest head. A double check valve or reduced pressure device may be placed at any location on-site, irrespective of elevation. The Unified Plumbing Code requires a licensed contractor to install backflow devices. 
A backflow device prevents contaminated water from being back-siphoned into a water supply should reverse flow occur. Atmospheric vacuum breakers, pressure vacuum breakers, double check valves , and reduced pressure devices are types of backflow devices.  
C.  Control valves. Control valves turn on and off the water to individual circuits of sprinklers or drip emitters. Ideally, the control valves are wired to an irrigation controller, or timer, making the system automatic. 
Control valves are sized based on the amount of acceptable friction loss. Typically, a control valve is sized one size smaller than the size of the largest lateral line downstream of the valve. Too little water running through an oversized valve may result in the control valve not opening properly. Pressure loss above the acceptable amount will either place undo stress on the control valve or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly. 
Separate control valves should be used for turf versus shrub beds. Different types of turf heads , i.e. spray versus rotors or impacts, should be placed on separate valves, due to their differing rates of water application. Ideally, shaded areas, i.e. areas with north or east facing exposures, should be on separate control valves, because of the limited amount of sun they receive. Drip irrigation lines should also operate on their own special valves which come equipped with a pressure regulator and a filter. 
The term head is short for sprinkler heads. Spray heads, rotor heads, impact heads are types of sprinkler heads.  
D.  Irrigation controllers. An automatic irrigation system provides a great amount of flexibility in programming your system and reduces the time spent to maintain landscaping. Irrigation controllers automatically turn on and off your control valves as you have programmed them and will operate irrigation systems at any time of the day or night. Some controllers even offer multiple start times, which can be important in keeping a newly seeded lawn moist or keeping your landscape alive during a hot summer day. While most controllers require an electrical source, there are battery operated and solar powered controllers for remote locations where electricity is not readily available. 
E.  Lateral lines. Lateral lines occur downstream of the control valves. The lateral lines are placed in the ground with a minimum of 12 inches of cover and usually are made of a rigid material, such as PVC Class 200 or greater. The sizing of lateral lines is also based upon acceptable friction loss. Pressure loss above the acceptable amount will either place undo stress on the lateral lines or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly. 
F.  Poly pipe. Poly pipe is black, flexible tubing that comes in various sizes. Poly pipe may be used as lateral lines where flexibility is needed. Poly pipe may also be used as a swing joint at the base of a turf head. Again, friction loss needs to be taken into account when choosing the correct size of poly pipe to use. 
A swing joint is a flexible swivel joint that allows for the installation of heads in difficult locations away from the line.  
G.  Turf heads. Turf heads come in a variety of configurations, with varying radii, patterns, PSI and GPM ratings. All turf heads should be pop-ups. Spray heads have the shortest spray radius and rotor heads, which are gear driven, and impact heads have larger spray radii. Turf heads with longer spray radii require greater water pressure and gallonage delivery. 
Pop-ups are sprinkler heads that retract below ground level when not in operation.  
Turf heads must be placed to provide head to head coverage, meaning the radius of one head must reach the base of the adjacent head. Improper coverage will result in dry spots with "diamond and doughnuts" or over watering to compensate for the lack of coverage. Refer to the manufacturer's product literature for the proper radius, gallons per minute and pressure performances. 

H.  Shrub heads. Shrub heads also come in a variety of configurations, similar to the turf heads. Shrub beds with dense planting are best suited for spray, rotor or impact type heads. Shrub heads should also be laid out in a head to head coverage pattern. For lower density plantings, bubblers or drip irrigation may be installed. There are adjustable bubblers that can be fine tuned to a slow drip, as a quasi-drip system, without the need for filters, pressure regulators, and purge valve. Drip irrigation will be discussed in a separate section. 
Bubblers are a type of shrub head.  
Shrub heads that occur along walkways or any area where people might walk should be pop-up type heads. This may require a 12-inch high pop to clear the adjacent shrubbery. 
I.  Drain valves. Drain valves are installed to allow for the draining of an irrigation system and can be manual valves or automatic. Drain valves need to be installed at low points within the main line and lateral lines. If automatic drain valves are installed, they will open every time pressure in the line drops and drain the system after each irrigation cycle. If you don't effectively drain your system for the winter, you may be looking a serious repair bill. 
Drain valves should not be installed upstream of a backflow device because the opening of the valve may allow for potential contaminants to enter the water supply. 
J.  Drip irrigation. Drip irrigation provides a slow, even application of water that penetrates deep into the soil and promotes drought tolerance in plants. Drip irrigation systems operate at a rate of gallons per hour (GPH) versus the gallons per minute rate used with standard irrigation systems. Due to the differing rate of application, it is possible that your drip irrigation system will run for hours, not minutes. Drip irrigations systems also operate at lower pressures than standard irrigation. All other components of a drip system are similar to those used in a standard system. While drip irrigation systems require a higher level of maintenance, they are highly efficient in delivering water to plants and help lower water costs. 
K.  Drip control valves. Like standard irrigation systems, a control valve is needed for drip systems. However, because of the small openings in the tubing and emitters, a drip system must have a filter and a pressure regulator, as well as a purge valve at the ends of the lines. Most drip irrigation manufacturers make a combination control valve, pressure regulator, and filter, to meet the needs of your drip system. 
Filters and pressure regulators are critical to the proper functioning of a drip irrigation system.  
L.  Drip lines. Downstream of the drip control valve are the drip lines. The drip line is typically a one-half inch diameter black, flexible pipe that can be routed along the ground or buried. Use a UV resistant drip line if you place the drip line above ground. 
Drip lines with emitter devices preset at even intervals are also available. This type of drip system requires rows of lines to provide uniform coverage in a shrub bed. 
M.  Drip emitters. Drip emitters control the flow of water being delivered to the soil. Emitters come in a variety of shapes and sizes with single or multiple outlets and also vary in gallonage rates. A single outlet emitter typically is inserted into the one-half-inch drip line with a barbed fitting. It may also be placed on a shrub riser with and adapter. A multi-outlet emitter (six to eight outlets) usually is placed on a shrub riser with a tee or an ell on the drip line. 
Micro-spray" heads for drip systems have relatively short radii and low gallonage rates. Often they are used similarly to standard spray heads. 
N.  Drip tubing. Drip tubing is typically a one-quarter-inch diameter black, flexible tube that is run on the ground, from the emitter to the plant. Ideally, the end of the tubing is secured with a stake and closed with a bug cap. 
O.  Purge valves. Even with a filter at the control valve, sediments have a way of clogging the drip system. Purge valves are ball valves placed at the ends of drip lines to allow for periodic flushing. In order to maintain proper functioning of a drip system, it is advised that drip lines are purged several times a year. 
Sec. 13.7 - Retaining walls and slopes. 
    13.7.1 Guideline introduction. The City of Farmington will review retaining wall design for conformance with generally accepted design and construction standards. The City of Farmington assumes no responsibility or liability for the design, construction or long term integrity of the wall. Review and approval of plans by the city is required in order to obtain a building permit. 
    13.7.2 Definitions. The following definitions are used in this handout: 
A.  Retaining wall. A landscaping technique intended to change the contour or grading of the lot. 
B.  Exposed height. The exposed height is measured from grade level to the top of the wall at a given location. 
C.  Problem soils. A soil type which may have a high water table, expansive clays, low weight bearing capacities, frost heave potential or other behavioral problems. 
    13.7.3 Overview of general requirements. Construction of any retaining wall with exposed height greater than one-foot six inches (18 inches) requires a building permit. Retaining walls with exposed heights of 36 inches or greater, or with a surcharge or a problem soil must be an engineered wall. 
    13.7.4 Zoning requirements. In addition to the structural review performed by building inspection, the development services department will review proposed retaining walls to ensure they meet all required setbacks and height restrictions regulated by the City of Farmington. Approval of setbacks and height requirements are completed prior to applying for a building permit. 
    The Community Development Department is located at 805 Municipal Drive, Farmington, NM, 87401. Please contact the Planning Division at (505) 599-1301 for further information. 
    13.7.5 Building permit application and approval requirements. 
A.  A complete site plan, drawn to scale, showing: 
(1)  Property boundaries; 
(2)  Location of existing structures; 
(3)  Location and dimensions of proposed retaining wall; and 
(4)  Indicate wall elevations and exposed height. 
B.  Approval signatures from the planning division. 
C.  Payment of required permit fees. 
D.  Approval by the building inspection department. 
E.  Obtain building permit or permits. 
    13.7.6 Retaining wall design guidelines. The following guidelines are designed to assist in building structurally sound retaining walls and shorten the process to obtaining permits: 
A.  Site specific conditions to consider include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Existing soil conditions at the wall location. 
(2)  Topography. 
(3)  Surface grade. 
(4)  External pressures and surcharges. 

B.  The City of Farmington recommends that retaining walls incorporate the following design principles: 
(1)  For each eight feet of vertical height, a four-foot horizontal offset should be provided. 
(2)  Walls should conform to the topography of the site. 
(3)  Walls with a change in alignment should incorporate the use of graduating steps rather than sharp corners to the greatest practical extent. 
C.  Additionally, as stated in subsection 5.4.7A., materials utilized in the construction of retaining walls; 
"Walls visible from public rights-of-way, within the frontyard setback(s), shall either incorporate the use of native materials or complement the native surroundings." 
    13.7.7 Slopes. When constructing a retaining wall along a slope, the following should be considered: 

    13.7.8 Public utility requirements. Call One Call at 1-800-321-2537 before excavating to ensure that the location of construction does not interfere with underground utility lines. One Call is a free service that marks the path of underground utilities on the property for those who are planning to excavate. Utility companies support One Call to prevent damage to their buried lines. If One Call is not contacted and damage occurs, you will be liable for all repair costs.
