that there are rules of ethical conduct for public officers and employees
which must be observed if a high degree of moral conduct is to be obtained
and if public confidence is to be maintained in our unit of local government.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promulgate these rules of ethical conduct
for the officers and employees of the Village of Colonie, New York. These

reason of being a volunteer fireman or civil defense volunteer.
§ 20-3. Standards of conduct.
Every officer or employee of the Village of Colonie, New York, shall be
subject to and shall abide by the following standards of conduct:

entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise or any other form, under
circumstances in which it would reasonably be inferred that the gift
was intended to influence him in the performance of his official duties
or was intended as a reward for any official action on his part. However,
recognizing the prevalent and accepted practice of the giving of gifts
during the Christmas season, such gifts are specifically excepted from
this section when it is clearly understood that the receipt of the gifts
will not influence the recipient in the performance of his duty. Each
member of the Village Board of Trustees, Planning Commission and

Christmas and other gifts for said year and shall submit such lists to the
Chairman of the Board of Ethics for the private information of said

capacity, shall decline or refuse to answer questions specifically or directly
relating to the performance of his or her official duties before any official,
board or agency authorized or empowered to so inquire into the
performance of such duties. This section shall not be construed as barring
any county officer or employee from exercising his or her constitutional
privilege against self-incrimination; however, when such body or agency is
wholly civil in nature, failure to fully cooperate with and diligently answer
the inquiries of such board or agency shall constitute grounds for dismissal
or removal of said officer or employee.

not receive or enter into any agreement, express or implied, for
compensation for services to be rendered in relation to any matter
before any agency of his or her municipality, whereby his or her

value of the services rendered.

other private interest he or she has in such legislation.

commercial or other private transaction which creates a conflict with

ARTICLE I
Defense and Indemnification
§ 37-1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to provide financial and legal protection for
those individuals serving the Village of Colonie from losses which may be
brought against them in their individual capacity for actions taken while
in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. In enacting
this article, the Board of Trustees finds that the State of New York has
enacted similar provisions for the legal and financial security of its officers
and employees and further finds that such security is also required for local
personnel. By enactment of this article, the right or responsibility of the
Village or its employees with regard to indemnification of legal defense is
defined. It is solely the intent of this article to provide similar coverage
for local employees as is presently provided for state employees so as to
continue to attract qualified individuals to local government service.
§ 37-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, unless the context otherwise requires, the following
terms shall have the meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE  Any person holding a position by election, appointment
or employment in the service of the Village of Colonie, whether or not
compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to participate in a
municipally sponsored volunteer program, but shall include a former
employee, his or her estate or a judicially appointed personal
representative.
§ 37-3. Duty of Village to provide defense; exception; private
counsel.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 37-5 of this
article, the Village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any
civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any
alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his
public employment or duties or which is brought to enforce a provision
of Section 1981 or 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code. This duty
to provide for a defense shall not arise where such civil action or
proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the Village of Colonie.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the
employee shall be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney;
provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to
representation by private counsel of his or her choice in any civil
judicial proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based
upon his investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the
case, that representation by the Village Attorney would be
inappropriate or whenever a court of competent jurisdiction, upon
§ 37-1 LOCAL LAWS, ADOPTION OF § 37-3
31:27
§ 37-4. Duty of Village to indemnify.
appropriate motion or by a special proceeding, determines that a
conflict of interest exists and that the employee is entitled to be
represented by private counsel of his or her choice. The Village
Attorney shall notify the employee, in writing, of such determination
that the employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel of
his or her choice. The Village Attorney may require, as a condition
to payment of the fees and expenses of such representation, that
appropriate groups of such employees be represented by the same
counsel. If the employee or group of employees is entitled to
representation by private counsel under the provisions of this article,
the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Village Board. Reasonable
attorney's fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the Village
to such private counsel, from time to time, during the pendency of
the civil action or proceeding subject to certification by the head of
the department, commission, division, office or agency in which such
employee is employed that the employee is entitled to representation
under the terms and conditions of this section and upon the audit
and warrant of the Village Treasurer. Any dispute with respect to
representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or the amount
of litigation expenses or the reasonableness of attorney's fees shall be
resolved by the court upon motion or by way of a special proceeding.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Village Attorney as required by § 37-5 of this article, the Attorney shall
take the necessary steps, including the retention of private counsel
under the terms and conditions provided in Subsection B on behalf of
the employee, to avoid entry of a default judgment pending resolution
of any question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a defense.
A. The Village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state
or federal court or in the amount of any settlement of a claim, provided
that the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his or her
public employment or duties. The duty to indemnify and save harmless
prescribed by this section shall not arise where the injury or damage
resulted from intentional wrongdoing or recklessness on the part of the
employee.
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Village Board of Trustees any proposed settlement
which may be subject to indemnification by the Village, and if not
inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the Mayor shall certify
such settlement and submit such settlement and certification to the
Village Attorney. The Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as
to form and amount and shall give his or her approval if, in his or her
judgment, the settlement is in the best interest of the Village. Nothing
in this section shall be construed to authorize the Village to indemnify
§ 37-3 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 37-4
31:28
§ 37-5. Conditions for defense and indemnification.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this article
shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Village Attorney or his or her
assistant, at his or her office, by the employee, of the original or a copy
of any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within
five days after he or she is served with such document and upon the full
cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or proceeding and
in the defense of any action or proceeding against the state based upon the
same act or omission and in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery
shall be deemed a request by the employee that the Village provide for his
or her defense pursuant to this article.
§ 37-6. Benefits exclusive to employees; workers' compensation.
The benefits of this article shall inure only to employees as defined herein
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any
provision of this article be construed to affect, alter or repeal any provision
of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 37-7. Effect on insurers.
The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
§ 37-8. Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to all actions and proceedings
pending on the effective date thereof or thereafter instituted.
§ 37-9. Effect on state and federal law.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this article, the provisions of
this article shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify,
abrogate or restrict any immunity available to or conferred upon any unit,
entity, officer or employee of the Village or any right to defense and/or
indemnification provided for any governmental officer or employee by, in
or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement not so
reviewed and approved by the Village Attorney.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against an employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail, within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the Mayor;
and if not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, such
judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such Mayor. If
the Attorney concurs in such certification, the judgment or settlement
shall be paid upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer.

ARTICLE II
Registration of Abandoned/Vacant Real Property
[Adopted 9-15-2014 by L.L. No. 5-2014]
§ 79-26. Intent.
It is the purpose and intent of the Village to establish a process to address
the number of abandoned/vacant real properties located within the Village.
It is the Village's further intent to specifically establish an abandoned/
vacant real property program as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods
from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and
security of abandoned/vacant properties. The Village Board finds that the
proliferation of vacant and abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings
in the Village of Colonie can cause a deterioration of communities and
areas within the Village and can have a negative impact on the value
of property in close proximity to the vacant and abandoned buildings,
structures and dwellings. Furthermore, the Village finds that vacant and
abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings can cause a serious threat
to the safety and welfare of the residents of the Village and can erode the
quality of life to all who live and work in the Village. Abandoned and vacant
buildings, structures and dwellings are places of infestation of rodents,
vermin, insects, wild animals and other health-threatening creatures and
diseases, provide shelter to criminals and vagrants who use such places
to evade the police and to conduct illicit activities, and are an attractive
nuisance to children and adults alike.
§ 79-27. Purpose.
The purpose of this article requiring the registration of all vacant and
abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings as referenced below, and the
payment of registration fees is to assist the Village in protecting the public
health, safety and welfare, to monitor the number of vacant and abandoned
buildings in the Village, to assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby businesses and the neighborhoods in which they are
located, particularly in light of firesafety hazards and unlawful, temporary
occupancy by transients, including illicit drug users and traffickers, and to
require the owners and mortgagees of such vacant or abandoned buildings
their registration and the payment of related fees, and to promote
substantial efforts to rehabilitate such vacant buildings. The provisions of
this article are applicable to the owners and mortgagees of such vacant or
abandoned buildings as set forth herein and are in addition to and not in
lieu of any and all other applicable provisions of this chapter, the health and
sanitation code, and any other applicable provisions of the Village of Colonie
Code.

§ 95-2. Purpose and legislative findings.
A. Completed combined taxicab business owners license application with

B. Completed taxi drivers licenses application, without attachments
regarding driving records, fingerprinting and photo.
A. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate and control the grading and
filling of land, the removal of topsoil and underlying materials and the
removal of vegetation within the Village of Colonie and to prescribe
regulations for said control.
B. Legislative findings.
§ 88-4 CLEARING, GRADING AND EROSION § 95-2
95:93
§ 95-3. Scope of regulations.
This chapter shall apply to applicants, developers and/or property owners
before the Planning Commission of the Village of Colonie for approval of any
kind of developments and to those other persons who propose to remove
any substantial vegetation or topsoil or perform any substantial grading or
filling operations affecting an area of 10,000 square feet or greater within
the Village of Colonie.
§ 95-4. Grading and erosion control plan and permit; fees.
(1) The Village of Colonie hereby finds that indiscriminate and
excessive grading and filling of tracts of land, the removal of topsoil
and/or the removal of vegetation has resulted in increased surface
drainage and soil erosion. Modification of existing topography has
resulted in the destruction of natural ground cover, which in turn
leads to airborne pollution, soil erosion, stream and pond
sedimentation, disruption of natural drainageways, often onto
adjacent land and public highways, and a general diminution of the
village's environmental qualities.
(2) The increased surface drainage and soil erosion produced thereby,
the indiscriminate removal of topsoil or vegetation and the change
of the contour of the land have caused additional private and public
costs for proper drainage control, decreasing the beneficial use of
existing public facilities and residential and commercial properties
and adversely affecting the health, safety and general welfare of
the inhabitants of the village.
A. No person, applicant, developer and/or property owner shall remove or
cause to be removed any substantial vegetation or topsoil or perform
any substantial grading or filling operations in an area of 10,000 square
feet or greater without first obtaining a permit from the Code
Enforcement Officer, who shall issue the permit after approval by the
Village Planning Commission. Before obtaining said permit, the person,
applicant, developer and/or property owner shall submit a completed
application on a form to be obtained from the Village Clerk, together
with a fee as set by the Village Board of Trustees by resolution from
time to time.
B. In addition, the person, applicant, developer and/or property owner
shall provide a sketch and description and time schedule for carrying
out the proposed activity and a description and timing of intended
erosion control methods, which data shall be reviewed and approved by
the Planning Commission prior to permit issuance by the Code
Enforcement Officer. Where the Planning Commission determines that
substantial work is contemplated, the Commission may require the
submission of a detailed grading and erosion control plan prepared by a
professional engineer or registered landscape architect, which plan
shall minimally include existing and proposed contours, key spot
§ 95-2 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 95-4
95:94
elevations, location and description of existing drainage patterns and
intended modifications, erosion control and revegetation measures,
location and description of existing vegetation and applicable soils
dates. All trees with a trunk diameter of eight inches or larger shall be
shown individually.
C. In cases where the Planning Commission requires the submission of a
detailed grading and erosion control plan, the applicant, developer and/
or property owner shall also be liable for reimbursement to the village
of costs of the technical review of his submission, which shall be paid
before a permit is issued. The applicant, permit holder, developer and/
or property owner shall also be liable for the cost of review of and
report on completed work, which shall be paid before the release of the
performance guaranty.
D. In cases where the Planning Commission is of the opinion that the
application has significant neighborhood or community interest, the
Commission may hold a public hearing before deciding on whether or
not to approve issuance of a permit. The cost of the notice shall be paid
by the applicant.
E. The Planning Commission may attach reasonable conditions to its
approval of any permit consistent with the objectives and/or criteria of
this chapter.
F. The submission of a detailed grading and erosion control plan will be
typically required by the Planning Commission if the proposed grading,
filling, excavation or land disturbance activity includes one or more of
the following conditions:
(1) The activity occurs on lands with a slope in excess of 15%.
(2) The activity occurs on lands which are highly erodible or classified
as unstable by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service.
(3) The activity involves the stripping of surface soils which exceed one
acre of surface area or a material volume of 40,000 cubic feet.
(4) The activity occurs within or immediately adjacent to the Patroon
Creek drainageway and any other brook, stream or surface drain,
the Pine Bush Preserve or land classified as primary or secondary
preserve by the Pine Bush Commission or any land adjacent to or
draining into the Bauer Environmental Park or Shaker Creek.
(5) Any activity which, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, may
have an adverse impact on adjacent or downstream properties.
G. The Planning Commission review and approval of the grading and
erosion control plan shall be based on the following criteria and
requirements, and the permit thereafter issued shall remain in force
and effect, provided that said person, applicant, permit holder,
§ 95-4 CLEARING, GRADING AND EROSION § 95-4
95:95
developer and/or property owner maintains compliance with the
following:
(1) The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one time
during the development.
(2) When land is exposed during development, the exposure shall be
kept to the shortest practical period of time.
(3) Temporary vegetation and/or emulsion shall be used to protect
areas in excess of 10,000 square feet exposed for a period over two
weeks at any time. Protective measures shall be as specified in the
permit or directed by the Village Engineer.
(4) On areas that will be exposed for short periods of time and where
weather conditions are conducive to airborne sand, traps to control
such sand shall be installed as directed.
(5) On areas such as temporary roadways, when dry conditions prevail,
the permit holder shall be required to apply water or calcium
chloride as required to prevent dust during construction activities.
(6) Sediment basins or debris basins (silting basins, silt traps or similar
measures) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment
from runoff waters on lands that are or have been exposed.
(7) Provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changing soils and surface conditions during and
after grading, filling, removal of topsoil or removal of vegetation
without impairment to adjacent properties or to drainageways.
(8) Permanent final vegetation and structures should be installed as
soon as practical.
(9) The plan should be fitted to the type of topography and soils so as
to create the least erosion potentials. The plan shall demonstrate
that the proposed grading activity accommodates natural
drainageways to the greatest extent possible and that the soil
characteristics of the site are suited to the grading, filling and
removal of vegetation proposed.
(10) Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected. Trees with a diameter greater than eight inches shall be
given special consideration for retention in the total plan.
H. If the Planning Commission finds that the permit holder, applicant,
developer and/or property owner has failed to comply with the
aforesaid control requirements of this chapter, said permit shall be
revoked, and said person(s), permit holder, applicant, developer and/or
property owner shall, upon written notice, cease and desist from any
further work upon said site. The notice, at the option of the Planning
Commission, may specify the conditions under which the Commission
would consider reinstating the permit; in such cases the Commission

95:96
§ 95-5. Performance guaranty.
§ 95-6. Exclusions.
The permit procedures contained in this chapter shall not apply to the
following actions:
will entertain a request to reinstate the permit once the Commission
finds that the conditions in its notice have been met to its satisfaction.
A. To ensure that the site work described by the person, permit holder,
applicant, developer and/or property owner on the approved grading
and erosion control plan is performed in accordance with said plan and
the controls of this chapter, the person, permit holder, applicant,
developer and/or property owner may be required to provide a
performance guaranty in the form of cash, bond or a letter of credit on
behalf of the Village of Colonie.
B. The sufficiency of such performance guaranty shall be determined by
the Planning Commission as to amount and the Village Attorney as to
form after review of the application and the work/operations to be
undertaken and in consultation with the Village Engineer.
C. Upon completion of the site work as set forth on said approved plan,
including the schedule of filling and grading, construction operation
and erosion control methods filed with the Planning Commission prior
to permit issuance, the person, permit holder, applicant, developer and/
or property owner shall request that the Village Engineer review said
work. Upon report by the Village Engineer that all conditions of the
permit and this chapter have been satisfied, the Planning Commission
shall direct the Village Treasurer to release the performance guaranty
submitted in relation to the issuance of the permit. Before releasing the
performance guaranty, the Village Treasurer shall make sure all fees
and other charges in connection with the permit have been paid.
D. Upon failure of the person, permit holder, applicant, developer and/or
property owner to perform the site work in accordance with the
approved plan submitted as aforesaid, the Village of Colonie and/or its
agents shall enter upon said premises and complete the necessary work
to satisfy the permit conditions and execute against the performance
guaranty for the cost of such work. The Village Treasurer shall be
authorized to pay any charge or charges approved by the Planning
Commission without further approval of the person, permit holder,
applicant, developer and/or property owner. If the village should
undertake completion of any such work (including but not limited to
grading, filling or revegetation work) upon the person's, permit
holder's, applicant's, developer's and/or property owner's failure to do
so, any sums remaining after the completion of said work shall be
returned to the person, permit holder, applicant, developer and/or
property owner.

§ 111-2. Intent.
The Village of Colonie has recognized the importance of providing the
Village's emergency services rapid entry into locked buildings. An
emergency access systems local law provides for the placement in secured,
locked containers of keys to important areas within a structure and
information that may be vital and necessary to the health, safety, and
welfare of the occupants and responding emergency crews. The delay in
gaining entry can result in substantial property damage, delays in providing
lifesaving or other medical procedures, and increased danger for
emergency services personnel and the building occupants. To assist the
emergency service providers in gaining rapid entry, the Village of Colonie
adopts an emergency access systems local law.

are generally unsightly and are obvious sources of potential danger. The
existence of such accumulations tends to depreciate not only the property
on which they are located but also the property of other persons. They
render the village a less safe and less pleasant place in which to live and
do business. The intent of this Article is to establish a legal procedure for
the removal of rubbish, garbage, litter, noxious growths or other debris on
lands in the Village of Colonie, New York, where they are found outside duly

NUISANCES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Unsafe buildings  See Ch. 85. Litter and weeds  See Ch. 145, Art. I.
§ 151-1. Purpose.
The Village Board of the Village of Colonie finds that public nuisances
sometimes exist in the Village of Colonie in the operation of establishments
across a wide range of businesses and private residences and the use of
property in violation of the penal laws relating to controlled substances,
dangerous drugs, prostitution, stolen property and illegal use or possession
of weapons, the defacement of private property, and other disturbances,
as well as other provisions of state and local law, all of which would
substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of the public in the
quality of life and total community environment, commerce in the Village,
property values and the public health, safety and welfare. The Village
Board further finds that the occurrence of such activities and violations is
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Village of
Colonie and to the businesses thereof and visitors thereto. It is the purpose
of this chapter to create a system to impose sanctions and penalties for
public nuisances, as defined by this chapter, and to permit the powers
created herein to be exercised either in conjunction with, or apart from, the
powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of procedures
and remedies available under such other laws. The Village Board further
finds that the sanctions and penalties imposed by the Hearing Officer
pursuant to this chapter constitute an additional and appropriate method
of law enforcement in response to the proliferation of the above-described

ARTICLE I
Garbage and Refuse Collection
§ 192-1. Purpose.
The Village Board of the Village of Colonie, New York, deems it in the
best interests of the citizens of the Village of Colonie to codify the rules
and regulations of the Department of Public Works providing for the
preparation, collection and removal of garbage, refuse and solid waste
within the village. These rules and regulations apply only to residential
dwellings from which the Department of Public Works collects solid waste
according to provisions of § 192-5. The Village Board also finds that the
removal of recyclable and reusable materials from the waste stream will
promote the health, safety and welfare of persons and property in the
Village of Colonie by minimizing the potential adverse effects of landfilling,
by reducing the need for landfills and conserving the space in existing
landfills, such as the Town of Colonie Sanitary Landfill, in which the village's
solid waste from residences is deposited, by aiding in the conservation of
valuable resources, materials and energy and by allowing for more efficient
and safe management of each of the component materials contained within
the solid waste stream. Further, source separation and segregation of
recyclable and reusable materials is an integral component of the solid
waste management plan of the solid waste planning unit in which the
Village of Colonie participates and the New York State Solid Waste
Management Act of 1988.
§ 192-2. Preparation of materials for collection; materials which
will not be collected.
A. Source separation.
(1) The following materials must be separated from other solid waste
and prepared for collection in accordance with this section or the
regulations of the Superintendent of Public Works:

all contaminants, such as lids, tabs and caps, removed; they
shall be placed in clear plastic bags.
(c) Grass, leaves and other garden debris shall be bagged and tied
in compostable paper bags.
(d) Tree trimmings shall be tied in bundles not exceeding four feet
in length.
(e) Bulky rubbish. Special arrangements must be made with the
Department of Public Works for the collection of these items,
except during designated heavy pickup periods.
(f) Broken glass and similar materials must be independently
wrapped before being placed in plastic bags.
B. The following materials will not be accepted:
(1) Dangerous wastes, such as paint, paint thinners, combustible
materials, explosives or any material classified as household
hazardous waste.
(2) Tires.

E. Preparation of solid waste from which source-separated material has
been removed. All solid waste from which source-separated materials
have been removed (see § 192-2A above) must be containerized using
heavy-duty plastic bags or metal containers. Such metal or plastic
containers shall have a maximum volume of 32 gallons and shall be
fitted with lids. The ends of plastic bags shall be tied securely.
A. The areas, routes and days of collection shall be determined by the
Village of Colonie Department of Public Works.

business day.
§ 192-2 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 192-3
192:230
§ 192-4. Scavenging.
Newspapers, other recyclable or reusable materials and other rubbish
materials placed at the curbside for collection shall become the property
of the Village of Colonie, and removal thereof by unauthorized persons,
commonly known as "scavengers," shall be a violation of this Article.
§ 192-5. Availability of service.
This program shall provide for weekly curbside collection and removal of
garbage and trash. This service shall be available to residential dwellings of
fewer than five units. It shall not be available for dwellings containing more
than four units nor for commercial, industrial or office buildings. Structures
containing mixed usage shall be considered commercial establishments and
shall provide for their own trash collection.
§ 192-6. Penalties for offenses.
§ 192-7. Promulgation of additional rules and regulations.
The Superintendent of the Department of Public Works is hereby authorized
to promulgate such other rules and regulations as may be necessary to
effectuate and supplement the provisions of this Article.
C. Refuse for collection, including source-separated material, is to be
placed at curbside prior to 5:00 a.m. on the scheduled day of collection
but not before 7:00 p.m. the prior day. Only refuse which has been
prepared in accordance with § 192-2 above will be collected.
A. Any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity who or which
shall knowingly and willfully violate or assist in the violation of the
provisions of this Article or who or which fails to comply with a lawful
directive from the Village of Colonie concerning the provisions of this
Article shall be guilty of a violation and subject to a fine not exceeding
$250 and/or to imprisonment for not more than 15 days for each
offense.
B. Additionally, containers that are in a dilapidated or unsanitary
condition, are oversized or otherwise do not conform to the
requirements set forth herein shall be removed by the Village of Colonie
upon a violator's failure, after written notice, to do so.

acceptable to the Village prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 193-10. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the Village's MS4 in violation of this article may have his
or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists or
potentially exists in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
(3) The Village shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to
this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO
to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.
§ 193-8 STORM SEWER SYSTEM § 193-10
193:239
§ 193-11. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Village in person or by telephone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the Village within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 193-12. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
(4) The Village has the right to require the facilities subject to this
article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary
to determine compliance with this article. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to a facility
subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person who is
the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an offense if
the person denies the Village reasonable access to the facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When the Village's SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/she
§ 193-10 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 193-12
193:240
§ 193-13. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Village Board within 15 days of its issuance, which shall
hear the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal, and within five
days of making its decision, file its decision in the office of the Village Clerk
and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the discharger.
§ 193-14. Corrective measures after appeal.
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(b) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;

contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(d) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(e) Payment of a fine; and
(f) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor, and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a

or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than
$15,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and, for such purpose only, all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
§ 193-12 STORM SEWER SYSTEM § 193-14
193:241
§ 193-15. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 193-16. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Village Attorney and concurrence of the
Stormwater Management Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this article.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.
(4) The violator acted quickly to remedy the violation.
(5) The violator cooperated in investigation and resolution.
B. Alternative remedies may consist of one or more of the following:

§ 194-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Development of real property and associated increases in site
impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including more silt in aquatic habitats for fish and
other desirable species.
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitats. Improper clearing of vegetation and burial of
vegetative and other wastes can result in unstable soil conditions and
the production of noxious gases through decomposition of said wastes.
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from real property
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
§ 193-19 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 194-1

§ 194-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact above. This chapter seeks to
meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 (construction runoff)
and 5 (postconstruction maintenance) of the SPDES General Permit for
Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer
Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, as amended or revised;
B. Require work on real property to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities, GP-02-01, as amended or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from activities on real
property in order to reduce flooding, silt, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize or decrease pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
activities on real property which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize or decrease the total annual volume of stormwater runoff
which flows from any specific site during and following development to
the maximum extent practicable;
F. Reduce or decrease stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion
and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices and to ensure that these management practices
are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety. Specific
consideration of stormwater runoff shall be provided to critical
watersheds; and
G. Eliminate unstable soil conditions and the production of noxious gases
which result from improper stormwater practices, improper grading
practices, improper clearing of vegetation and the burial of vegetative
and other wastes.

of inspection by its construction inspector from the moneys on
deposit in said account and shall return to the applicant any such
moneys, including interest, on balance in the account at the time of
completion of the permitted site work, provided that all inspection
costs have been paid. If the moneys on deposit prove to be
insufficient for the costs of required inspections, the Department
of Public Works shall require that the applicant deposit additional
moneys in an amount sufficient to satisfy the costs of such
additional inspections as may be required.
(3) The applicant or developer of the land development activity or their
representative shall, at all times, properly operate and maintain all
facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related
appurtenances) which are installed or used by the applicant or
developer to achieve compliance with the conditions of this
chapter. Sediment shall be removed from sediment traps or
sediment ponds whenever their design capacity has been reduced
by 50%.
(4) For land development activities meeting any of the conditions set
forth in § 194-6C(1)(a) through (c), (project activity of between one
and five acres of land during course of job, exclusive of one-family
residences and construction activities at agricultural properties, or
stormwater runoff from land development activities disturbing five
or more acres, or stormwater runoff from land development
activities discharging a pollutant of concern to either an impaired
water or a TMDL-designated watershed), the applicant shall have a
qualified professional conduct site inspections and document the
effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control practices every
seven days and within 24 hours of any storm event producing 0.5
inch of precipitation or more. Inspection reports shall be
maintained in a site logbook.
B. Maintenance easements. Prior to the issuance of any approval that has
a stormwater management facility as one of the requirements, the
applicant or developer must execute a maintenance easement
agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent landowners served
by the stormwater management facility. The easement shall provide for
access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the
Village of Colonie to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper
working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions
established by this chapter. The easement shall be recorded by the
grantor in the office of the County Clerk after approval by the Colonie
Village Attorney.
C. Maintenance after construction. The owner or operator of permanent
Stormwater Management Practices installed in accordance with this
chapter shall ensure they are operated and maintained to achieve the

new maintenance personnel.
(3) Discharges from the SMPs shall not exceed design criteria or cause
or contribute to water quality standard violations in accordance
with § 194-7C, Water quality standards.
D. Maintenance agreements. The Village of Colonie shall approve a formal
maintenance agreement for stormwater management facilities which
are going to be privately owned after construction. The agreement shall
be binding on all subsequent landowners and recorded in the office of
the County Clerk as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan
approval. The maintenance agreement shall be consistent with the
terms and conditions of a sample stormwater control facility
maintenance agreement on file at the Department of Public Works. The
Village of Colonie, in lieu of a maintenance agreement, at its sole
discretion, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater
management facility, provided such facility meets all the requirements
of this chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and
sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular
maintenance.
A. Inspection.
(1) In addition to the DEC inspections required to be performed by the
applicant, the Village of Colonie Stormwater Management Officer
or his designee may require such inspections as necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter and may either approve
that portion of the work completed or notify the applicant wherein
the work fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter and
the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), as approved. To
obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify the Village of Colonie
enforcement official at least 48 hours before any of the following,
as required by the Superintendent of Public Works:
(a) Start of construction.
(b) Installation of sediment and erosion control measures.
(c) Completion of site clearing.
§ 194-8 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 194-9
194:258
(d) Completion of rough grading.
(e) Completion of final grading.
(f) Close of the construction season.
(g) Completion of final landscaping.
(h) Successful establishment of landscaping in public areas.
(2) If any violations are found, the applicant and developer shall be
notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required
corrective actions. No further work shall be conducted on the site,
including on structures located thereon, except for site
stabilization, until any violations are corrected and all work
previously completed has received approval by the Stormwater
Management Officer.
B. Inspection of stormwater facilities after project completion. Inspection
programs shall be established on any reasonable basis, including but
not limited to routine inspections; random inspections; inspections
based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection
of drainage basins or areas identified as higher-than-typical sources of
sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses
or industries of a type associated with higher-than-usual discharges of
contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more
likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal
water or sediment quality standards or the SPDES stormwater permit;
and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include but are not
limited to reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling
discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in
drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage
control facilities and other stormwater management practices.
C. Submission of reports and record plans. The Village of Colonie
Stormwater Management Officer may require monitoring and reporting
from entities subject to this chapter as necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. All applicants are required to submit
record plans for any stormwater management practices located on site
after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final
design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must
be certified by a licensed professional.
D. Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new stormwater management
facility is installed on private property or when any new connection is
made between private property and the public stormwater system, the
landowner shall grant to the Village of Colonie the right to enter the
property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the
purpose of inspection.
§ 194-9 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION § 194-9
194:259
E. Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land development activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the Village of Colonie in its
approval of the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Village may
require the applicant or developer to provide, prior to construction, a
performance bond, cash escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit from an
appropriate financial or surety institution which guarantees
satisfactory completion of the project and names the Village of Colonie
as the beneficiary. The security shall be in an amount to be determined
by the Village based on submission of final design plans, with reference
to actual construction and landscaping costs. The performance
guarantee shall remain in force until the surety is released from liability
by the Village of Colonie, provided that such period shall not be less
than one year from the date of final acceptance or such other
certification that the facilities have been constructed in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and that a one-year
inspection has been conducted and the facilities have been found to be
acceptable to the Village. Per annum interest on cash escrow deposits
shall be reinvested in the account until the surety is released from
liability.
F. Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion
and sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the
developer or by a corporation that owns or manages a commercial or
industrial facility, the developer, prior to construction, may be required
to provide the Village of Colonie with an irrevocable letter of credit
from an approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper
operation and maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion
control facilities, both during and after construction and until the
facilities are removed from operation. If the developer or landowner
fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities, the Village of Colonie may draw
upon the account to cover the costs of proper operation and
maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
G. Recordkeeping. The Village of Colonie may require entities subject to
this chapter to maintain records demonstrating compliance with this
portion of the Village of Colonie Land Use Law.21
H. Notice of violation. When the Village of Colonie determines that a
project is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter, it may issue a written notice of violation to the landowner,
and also, if necessary to the developer, the builder, the subcontactor or
anyone else responsible for the work being performed. The notice of
violation shall contain:
(1) The name and address of the landowner, developer or applicant;
21.Editor's Note: See Ch. 199, Subdivision of Land.

assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is
directed; and
(6) A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to
the Village by filing a written notice of appeal within five days of
service of notice of violation.
I. Stop-work orders. The Village of Colonie may issue a stop-work order
for violations of this chapter. Persons receiving a stop-work order shall
be required to halt all work of any nature on the site, including on any
structures located thereon, except those activities that address the
violations leading to the stop-work order. The stop-work order shall be
in effect until the Village of Colonie confirms that the project is in
compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure
to address a stop-work order in a timely manner may result in civil,
criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement
measures authorized in this chapter.
J. Violations. Any land development activity that is commenced or is
conducted contrary to this chapter may be restrained by injunction or
otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
K. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $10,000 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than
$15,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed
misdemeanors and, for such purpose only, all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
L. Withholding of certificate of occupancy. If any building or land
development activity is installed or conducted in violation of this

any means whatsoever. The Board of Trustees, on its own initiative, may
establish a street over land owned by the village in accordance with these
rules and regulations.
§ 196-24. Procedure.
A. The owner(s) of the right-of-way of the proposed street shall submit to
the Board of Trustees the following in triplicate:
(1) A letter formally offering the right-of-way at no cost to the village,
together with any additional easements that may be required, such
as for drainage.
(2) A map prepared by a licensed surveyor and a metes and bounds
description.
(3) Any other information, plans, designs or calculations with regard to
the right-of-way and the improvements therein or made necessary
by the proposed street, to the same standards as specified in
Chapter 199, Subdivision of Land.
(4) A report by the Village Engineer that the street and all required
improvements have been designed and substantially completed in
accordance with the standards, specifications and requirements of
Chapter 199, Subdivision of Land. Where the right-of-way was not
created as the result of a subdivision approved by the Planning
Commission within the last three years, the owner(s) will be
responsible for the cost of preparing this report; in other cases, the
Village Engineer's report in connection with the subdivision may be
used.
(5) A maintenance bond in the amount of 10% of the costs of all
improvements in or associated with the street to be dedicated, to
§ 196-22 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION § 196-24
194:275
run for two years. This bond is to cover the cost of repairs to such
improvements during the two-year period. This bond or as much of
it as is left over after paying for any repairs will be released by the
Board of Trustees on the recommendations of the Village Engineer
and the Planning Commission after the expiration of the two-year
retainage period. Where the right-of-way of a street was created as
the result of a subdivision approved by the Planning Commission
within the last six months, the maintenance bond of the subdivision
may be substituted.
(6) The proposed deed.
(7) A title report.
(8) Checks covering the estimated costs of notice of public hearing and
engineering services, as estimated by the Village Clerk and Village
Engineer respectively.
B. When the Board of Trustees finds that all the material required in
Subsection A above has been received complete and in good order, it
will:
(1) Refer the bond and deed to the Village Attorney for a report.
(2) Request a report from the Planning Commission on whether
acceptance of the proposed street would, in its opinion, be in the
public interest; this report may be dispensed with if the right-ofway
of the proposed street is part of a subdivision approved by the
Planning Commission within the last three years.
(3) Schedule a public hearing as required by state law.
C. The Board of Trustees will hold the required public hearing as
scheduled previously.
D. Within 60 days of the public hearing or within any additional time
period agreed to by the Board of Trustees and the owners of the rightof-
way of the proposed street, the Board of Trustees will, by resolution,
either accept or reject the offer of dedication; the resolution will recite
the reasons why acceptance or rejection, as the case may be, are in the
public interest. If the Board of Trustees fails to act within the stated
time, the offer will be considered rejected and no longer binding on the
owner(s) of the right-of-way.
E. Within 60 days of the resolution accepting the proposed street, the
owner(s) of the right-of-way shall deliver to the Board of Trustees an
executed deed for the land of the new street. Failure to deliver the deed
on time shall relieve the Board of Trustees of the obligation to accept
the street.

§ 196-43 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 196-47
194:288
§ 196-47. Building design.
Note: For any of the historic buildings within the district, the standards
from the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation shall apply.
As described above, the busy commercial corridor contrasts with the quiet
nature of the neighborhoods within the Village of Colonie. New buildings
and building improvements along the corridor should enhance the
pedestrian nature of the district, in scale, interest, detailing and amenities,
to be a positive aesthetic addition to the area. Design for buildings in
the Commercial District should provide quality design, durable materials,
pedestrian comfort and quality of life with connections to the
neighborhoods.
A. Include interest in the building massing and detailing to create
pedestrian comfort, human scale and to provide an asset to the Village
and the surrounding neighborhoods.
B. Additions to existing structures should take into account the entire
building to create a cohesive building design that enhances the most
significant architectural features of the building.
C. Consider including architectural detailing to complement the
significant surrounding buildings and neighborhoods.
D. Include detail that increases building interest and creates light and
shadow, such as piers, storefront windows, upper windows, columns,
arcades, porticos, trellises, porches, balconies, dormers, awnings and
brise soleils, with attention to trim and eaves. Consider including a
change in wall plane at transitions between materials.
E. Consider orientation of the sun and natural light in building design.
Brise soleils, opaque awnings, porticos or trellises may enhance southfacing
windows or walls. North-facing windows may benefit from glass
awnings to allow north light to penetrate building, while adding rain
protection. Allow for plaza, outdoor courtyards or seating areas
oriented toward the sun adequately shaded.
F. Repeat design and decorative building elements in all elevations, not
just the front facade.
G. Avoid long expanses of blank walls.
H. Encourage a diversity of architectural materials, forms and styles that
respect the traditions of architecture within the Village, including gable
or hipped roof forms, standing seam metal roofing, and brick and wood
siding (not vinyl).
I. Modern architectural styles should not be avoided. However, buildings
of modern style should follow the design guidelines recommended in
this document.

194:289
§ 196-48. Building scale; massing; height.
§ 196-49. Rooflines.
Rooflines have functional purposes such as to direct water away from the
building and to allow for shading of the window below. In addition, roof
design provides opportunities to create an interesting building profile, to
enhance the building mass and to affect the overall composition of the
building design.
J. The architectural character of individual and groups of buildings should
be coordinated to create a locally distinctive character, identity and
sense of place.
A. Building massing should reflect traditional lot widths and create a
composition with a human scale. This will help reduce the perceived
mass of larger buildings.
B. Consider breaking up the front of a larger building by dividing it into
individual bays or blocks of 20 to 40 feet wide.
C. Use variation in textures, materials, patterns, colors, building plane and
details to break down the mass and scale of the building. Consider
using articulation of the building to express base, water tables, string
courses, cornices and fenestration to reduce the apparent size of a
large building.
D. Use transparency in design to open the facade to pedestrians, including
storefront or large display windows, porticoes, overhangs and partially
enclosed terraces.
E. The height of buildings should be within that allowable by the Zoning
Ordinance.25 Multiple-story buildings are encouraged.
A. The top of the facade should be terminated in a way that complements
and enhances the character of the building and the surrounding
Commercial District.
B. Rooflines should be designed in proportion to the overall height and
mass of the proposed building, creating a distinction between the top of
the building and the lower floors.
C. Overhangs on pitched roofs should be sufficient to keep water off the
face of the building and to allow for architectural articulation.
D. Flat-roofed commercial buildings may have a parapet to raise the
height of the facade to create an appropriate scale. The parapet or roof
should be detailed to create an appropriate scale. The parapet or roof
should be detailed to create an attractive and balanced facade.

§ 196-50. Entrances.
The entrance to the building is the introduction to the interior and,
arguably, the most important design element of the structure. Entrances
should be attractive to vehicular passersby and to pedestrians.
§ 196-51. Building facades.
The cumulative effect of the building facades creates the overall character
of the commercial areas. The care in their design, detailing and
maintenance can enhance or deter the community image of the Village.
Facades also project an image for the businesses they house and can
provide a sense of care and community pride for their inhabitants.
E. Long horizontal roof or parapet lines are not acceptable. Interrupt
rooflines with architectural treatment and features. The maximum
acceptable unbroken roofline is 30 feet.
F. Distinctive roof forms, profiles and cornices should be maintained.
Alterations which are neither consistent with the original design nor
significant in their own right should be discouraged and/or removed.
G. Roofs shall be an integral part of building design. False mansard roofs
are not acceptable in new developments or redevelopments.
A. Whatever the building's architectural style, define and celebrate
building entries by use of human scale, architectural details and
elements, such as arches, posts, awnings, transoms, extensive use of
glass and first floor transparency, attractive doors and hardware, etc.
B. Orient main entries toward the primary direction of access. Secondary
entries from the street, facing a public space in the case of a grouping
of buildings around a public plaza or from the interior of a block or
parking lot, should be designed to complement the overall design of the
building.
C. The building facade, which faces the primary street, should be open and
inviting.
D. Safe, comfortable and adequate pedestrian access should be provided
to the primary entrance from the parking area and from the sidewalk
along the primary roadway.
E. Rear entrances should be developed as necessary to provide access to
Commercial District businesses, and should be maintained to support
the overall appearance and convenience of the District.
A. Whether the building is an example of modern or traditional
architecture, it should respect traditional rhythms and the scale of
other buildings in the area; it should also work to enhance the overall
character of the area through quality materials, building details and
craftsmanship.
§ 196-49 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION § 196-51
194:291
§ 196-52. Storefronts and first floor office design.
Storefronts provide an opportunity to present an establishment's character
and project a business image. They are an invitation into the building.
A neat and attractive showcase for appealing product or service displays
enhances the image of a business and improves the pedestrian nature
of the district. Quality storefront design, restoration and renovation can
go a long way towards enhancing the apparent economic success of an
area and creates a place where visitors will want to return. Typical strip
development has nearly done away with storefront displays and reserved all
display of goods to the interior. This is typical of automobile-oriented versus
B. Building facades should provide a high standard of construction and
appearance.
C. Architectural detailing should be designed to enhance the human scale
of the buildings. Building facades can be articulated with architectural
features such as piers and columns, porticos, pitched roofs with details
such as detailed fascias, or flat roofs with interesting cornices, recessed
and projecting bays and three-dimensional elements of architectural
details, balconies, signs, trellises, porticoes and awnings to create a
high quality design. Large expanses of unarticulated blank wall should
be avoided.
D. Where existing development does not provide appropriate examples,
new development should strive to implement the intended vision with
quality design rather than repeat existing patterns.
E. Building detailing and architectural elements and features such as
signs, lighting and awnings should enhance the individual character of
the building or grouping of buildings and should complement the colors
and features of adjacent buildings.
F. At corner sites, facades facing side streets should be designed to
transition gracefully from the front facade and to improve the overall
character of the area. Side and rear facades visible from the street,
parking or from lots by pedestrians should be designed to be neat and
attractive.
G. Chain businesses should be designed to fit into and enhance the Village
commercial corridors and complement the surrounding neighborhoods.
Design each project specifically with regard to its own site to enhance
the environment and improve the life of the corridors.
H. Where making transitions between developments, avoid jarring
contrasts in building scale, forms, materials or colors.
I. Use a proportion of openings vertical and horizontal that is generally
consistent with the style of the building. More traditionally designed
openings are typically vertically proportioned.
J. Storefronts should use large display windows at the street level.
§ 196-51 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 196-52
194:292
pedestrian-friendly environments. Storefronts and ground floor offices
should have a character that will enhance the human or pedestrian
character of the commercial area, rather than be designed as "big box" style
architecture, with little to no detail.
§ 196-53. Windows and doors.
Windows and doors should be part of an overall composition of solid and
void of the building. They should be of a quality and composition to enhance
the overall facade while serving the practical purposes of protecting the
building's interior from the elements and providing daylight, air, passage
and security. They also provide an opportunity to allow for window displays,
to enhance the character of the building they occupy and to provide
transparency and an inviting character at the entry.
A. Consider using a pattern of solids and voids for openings that relate to a
more traditional building design in the corridor, even in modern
construction. Storefronts should reflect the significant storefront
rhythms and proportions found throughout attractive pedestrian
commercial districts.
B. New storefronts or ground floor offices and alterations should
complement or enhance the overall design of the applicant's building
and should be compatible with and complement the scale, massing and
character or other significant details of their own building facades.
They should enhance the district with appropriate colors, high-quality
material, well-designed details and thoughtful door locations.
Storefronts should relate to the rest of the buildings and the site design.
C. Street-level facades should be differentiated from the upper floors to
create a visual base for the building and a pedestrian-friendly scale.
This can be achieved by architectural treatment and materials
selection.
D. Forty-five percent to 75% of the storefront, other retail or commercial
office building street-level facade should be transparent through the
use of glass windows, doors and window displays. The intent is to
maximize the transparency of the storefront in order to enhance the
pedestrian nature of the street and invite entry to the business. This
may be partially offset by the use of pergolas, porticoes, landscaping or
other pedestrian-friendly enhancements.
E. Attractive storefront displays are an important feature for the
pedestrian experience. Storefront display areas should be well thought
out and constructed using quality materials and craftsmanship to
create attractive, changeable displays. Attention should also be paid to
enhancing the permanent display floor, casework, shelving, display
platforms, background and interior storefront lighting.
§ 196-52 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION § 196-53
194:293
§ 196-54. Building materials; textures; historic details.
The choice of materials and texture has a great impact on the perception
of the property and the district. The objective is to create an attractive
area that evokes economic prosperity with visual interest and pedestrian
comforts to encourage repeat visits and a high degree of visitor comfort. In
addition, traditional materials, natural materials and quality materials for
construction should be used.
A. A high percentage of glass in entrance doors and proximate to the
entrance is generally recommended for creating welcoming commercial
facades.
B. When refurbishing an existing building, window replacements should
match, to the greatest extent practical, original window size, style and
configuration.
C. For upper-story windows, necessary repair or replacement work should
match the original window in material and style, sash configurations
and size.
D. As a rule, a deep sash profile and window depth behind the face of the
building adds aesthetic interest to the facade and should be sought in
window selection. (Wood windows and doors are preferred, but high
quality metal or clad is acceptable.)
E. Only clear, colorless glass (no tinted glass) should be used for display
windows. Translucent or colored glass may be used for design details.
F. For storefronts at the sidewalk level, storefront windowsills should be
located 16 inches to 24 inches with a maximum of 30 inches above the
finished floor.
A. Choose high quality materials and paint to prevent degradation and for
ease of maintenance. The Village of Colonie has a mix of architectural
styles. Facade improvements should be composed of materials that
should be equal to or exceed the quality of appearance of traditional
materials. They can encompass a wide range of materials from brick,
stone and wood to metal panels, ironwork and glass. Masonry should be
encouraged, as it is a durable, low-maintenance material that provides
texture.
B. Use materials to provide visual interest. Encourage materials that offer
texture.
C. Use quality materials consistently on all visible sides of commercial,
office and multifamily residential buildings.
D. Uncover, retain and restore any significant original building elements
that still exist, such as cornices, window trim and roof brackets.
Historic building materials and details should not be covered over.
§ 196-53 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 196-54
194:294
§ 196-55. Color.
Color is an intrinsic part of the overall character and composition of
architecture and site design and can enhance the appearance of the
districts. Colors should be carefully chosen. Brick, concrete and stone have
an inherent color. Other surfaces have applied color from paint or enamel.
Awnings, lighting and signs provide another opportunity for color.
Building alterations that are neither consistent with the original design
nor significant in their own right should be removed.
E. In cases where improvements are to be made to commercial properties
with prior additions that contrasts in style, attempts should be made to
bring any significant character of the older structure into the
improvements in order to consider the overall design in the total
building composition and detailing. If unable to rehabilitate original
materials and/or details, replacement materials and design should
match or exceed the quality of the original.
F. Prohibited or questionable materials.
(1) Artificial products such as plastics, vinyl, aluminum siding, plywood
siding and T1-11.
(2) Rough-hewn lumber.
(3) Artificial stucco products are not prohibited but are not
recommended. If they are to be used, a sufficient amount of detail
should be included to mimic the interest of traditional buildings.
(4) In most cases, modular cultured stone units and plain concrete
block should not be used, unless specific approval is granted.
A. A coordinated palette of colors should be composed for each
development.
B. Colors should be selected to enhance the overall character and
composition of the building, be harmonious with the overall streetscape
and improve the district's appearance.
C. Generally, use of natural tints of materials such as reds, browns, tans,
grays and greens are best as primary colors. Save bright accent colors
for awnings and signs on commercial buildings.
D. A simple color scheme is generally suited to a quality storefront.
Generally, there is a wall color, trim color, accent color and roof color.
E. The quality of preparation for painting as well as the quality of the paint
can go a long way toward extending the life of the paint job. Use paint
manufactures' top quality line colors.
F. Color variation can give visual interest to a building.
§ 196-54 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION § 196-55
194:295
§ 196-56. Building lighting.
Lighting presents an opportunity to enhance a facade and the surrounding
area. The lighting fixtures chosen can add to the character of the storefront,
improve the business image, and enliven the street. Picturesque, articulated
evening lighting creates an appealing district to attract evening visitors.
§ 196-57. Awnings and canopies.
Awnings and canopies can be used to reinforce the design characteristics
of the building's architecture, provide an opportunity for a design accent,
and also serve practical functions. They can shield pedestrians from rain
and can shade them and merchandise from the sun. Generally, they are
not appropriate on the north side of buildings that will get little to no sun,
unless transparent for weather protection and aesthetic appeal. For the
purposes of these guidelines, the definition of an "awning" is a protective
sloped projection over the door, window or storefront of a building,
generally supported by a frame attached to the building. A canopy is a
horizontal, ornamental and protective flat projection from a building facade,
generally cantilevered out from a building, that may be supported by the
building wall above.
G. Do not use strong colors that produce the impression that the entire
building is a sign.
A. The fixtures chosen and their illumination qualities should complement
the architectural character of the building and district.
B. Lighting of storefronts and of storefront displays until 11:00 p.m.
should be encouraged to enhance the overall appearance of the district
in the evening.
C. Building lighting should be used to illuminate main signs, streetside
storefront displays and the building's architectural features, as well as
to enhance outside seating areas.
D. Lighting should not call attention to itself (such as blinking lights) or
cause light spillage to pedestrians, adjacent buildings or to the sky,
temporary holiday lights excluded.
E. Awnings should not be internally illuminated to avoid overemphasizing
the storefront at the expense of the rest of the building's facade.
F. Prohibited items.
(1) Industrial lighting is prohibited.
(2) Low-pressure sodium should not be used.
A. Design awnings and canopies should provide pedestrian comfort, solar
and rain protection, as well as keep good building aesthetics in mind.
§ 196-55 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 196-57
194:296
§ 196-58. Air conditioners; satellite dishes; roof-mounted
equipment; mechanicals; other appurtenances.
B. Coordinate the choice of awning and canopy designs, proportions,
colors and materials as part of an overall building design scheme. Note:
They should not be the primary design element of the building.
C. Place awnings and canopies within and in relation to the structural
frame of the storefront, window or doorway; generally, this means
within a window frame or within the frame formed by the storefront
cornice or sign panel above and by vertical piers or columns on either
side. Alternatively, they may be mounted between a transom and
display window to allow light into a business.
D. The frame of the awning or canopy should be a minimum of eight feet
six inches above the pavement. The bottom of an awning or canopy
valance should be a minimum of eight feet above the pavement.
E. Valances should extend a maximum of 12 inches.
F. Generally, canopies should have thin visual profiles so as to obscure as
little of the building and storefront as possible.
G. Color and style of any awnings for upper-story windows should
coordinate with any street level awnings.
H. Good quality cotton or acrylic awning canvas, such as Sunbrella fabric,
is acceptable. Well-designed canopies or awnings of glass and steel or
standing seam metal are permitted to enhance the overall building
design. Other materials are subject to approval. Items to be
discouraged include:
(1) Backlit awnings are prohibited, but quality down lighting is
permitted to illuminate the sidewalk and storefront.
(2) Materials such as vinyl, plastic, aluminum (except for awning
frames) and fiberglass are prohibited for awnings since they
generally detract from the character of the commercial district.
(3) Bubble awnings.
(4) Awnings may not project across multiple buildings, but should
enhance the individual nature of their building.
A. Air conditioners should not project beyond the building face. For
permanently installed units, openings should be trimmed to provide a
finished opening around unit.
B. Satellite dishes and cable wiring should not be visible from across the
street of the principal building facade.
C. Appurtenances should be installed as to not detract from the building
appearance or cover or damage architectural details.
§ 196-57 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION § 196-58
194:297
§ 196-59. Facade maintenance and building stabilization.
Well-maintained buildings show pride and care in the Village and will
enhance its economic viability and quality of life. In addition, general
building and facade stabilization is important to preserve the architectural
integrity and longevity of the building. Facades should be maintained in
a state of general cleanliness to give a sense of economic success and
a sense of pride in the community and to impart the desire of visitors
to return. It is the responsibility of the building and business owners to
maintain their buildings in good repair. Cracked windows, peeling paint,
and burnt out lamps all diminish the professional image and pedestrian
nature of the Village's commercial areas. All work needs to conform to state
building code requirements, per the Secretary of the Interior's Standards
for Rehabilitation and per good trade practices for good quality
construction and rehabilitation. Work should include but not be limited to:
§ 196-60. Signs.
Signs are the flagship of the quality and character of the commercial
district. They present a vital design opportunity as well as identify the name
of the establishment. Their design can show the flair of a business, relay the
nature of the business and present an image of the quality of the business.
Signs should be harmonious with the architectural style of the property
and enhance the character of the surrounding district. Signs provide an
opportunity to add color, interest, detail and depth to the facade. Sign
designs must be included along with the building permit application to relay
the overall building design and sign design approval must be obtained from
the Village Sign Review Board. Signage must conform with the Code of the
Village of Colonie, Chapter 181, Signs (Village of Colonie Sign Law). Please
review this code prior to the design, erection, construction, alteration,
enlargement or relocation of any sign within the Village of Colonie.
D. Roof-mounted equipment and mechanicals shall not be visible from any
ground angle. Their masking should be an integral part of overall
architectural design with regard to form, materials and color.
A. Masonry repair and repointing which should follow the National Park
Service Historic Preservation Briefs.
B. Cornice flashing and repair.
C. Window flashing and repair.
D. Building detail repair, including wood and metals.
A. General guidelines.
(1) All signs should be of professional quality.
(2) The sign design should be clear and easy to read, and balance a
positive image for the business it represents and the overall district
appearance.
§ 196-58 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 196-60
194:298
(3) Consider creating signs that are not flat, but three-dimensional
through depth, materials and construction. Attention can also be
given to create interest with the sign profile.
(4) The use of trade images within sign design, such as bread for a
market, a coffee cup for a cafe or a bagel for a bagel bakery
provides easy trade recognition and understanding for visitors and
passersby and can add character and color to the storefront and
the district.
(5) Sign copy should be limited to the name, address, function and logo
of the establishment.
(6) Signs are permitted only to refer to the establishments located
within the buildings where the signs are located and not offpremises
businesses.
(7) Attractive sign lighting should be designed in conjunction with sign
design.
(8) Historically significant signs should be retained if possible.
Significant signs painted on masonry walls on buildings like the
former/historic movie theater, for example, should be retained, if
possible, even if the business is no longer in existence.
(9) Be considerate in sign placement to not obstruct the visibility of
adjacent properties of businesses.
(10) Separate number signs of the street address with twelve-inch
letters in Arabic numerals shall be affixed to the building per the
Village of Colonie Code.
(11) Additional signs allowed in the Code of the Village of Colonie not
listed below, including temporary signs, drive-through signs, signs
on parked vehicles, on-site advisory signs, and signs in residential
districts shall be crafted with quality design and fabrication to
make the signs attractive, balancing visibility with overall
enhancement of the district. These signs shall not detract from the
aesthetics of the district, nor the intent of these guidelines.
B. Sign types.
(1) Awning and canopy signs. Awning and canopy signs are visual
messages incorporated into the valance of an awning, or affixed to
a canopy.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 199-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision
Regulations of the Village of Colonie."
§ 199-2. Compliance required.
Before any person, corporation or other entity sells, conveys or transfers or
offers to sell, convey or transfer any parcel created by the subdivision of
land, said person, corporation or other entity shall obtain final approval of
the final development plan(s) by the Planning Commission and shall comply
with the provisions of this chapter. "Subdivision" shall mean the division of
any parcel of land into two or more lots, plots, sites or other division of land
for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership or
building development and shall include resubdivision.
§ 199-3. Declaration of policy and purpose.
A. It is declared to be the policy of the Village Planning Commission to
consider land subdivisions as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and
economical development of the Village of Colonie. Land to be
subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building
purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other
menace. Proper provisions shall be made for drainage, water, sewerage
and other needed improvements. The proposed streets shall compose a
convenient system to conform to the Official Village Map and shall be
properly related to the proposals shown on the Town of Colonie Map, if
applicable. Streets shall be of such width, grade and location as to
accommodate the prospective traffic, to afford adequate light and air
and to facilitate fire protection. In proper cases, park areas of suitable
location, size and character for playground or other recreational

approval from the New York State Department of
Transportation or the County Department of Public Works for
said intersection.
(l) Any owner, developer or contractor, in order to comply with
these regulations, shall, at the time of application, provide a
performance bond, letter of credit or certified check in an
amount determined by the Village Engineer to be equal to the
cost of required street, utility, drainage and landscaping work.

[3] Such supplemental specifications and/or major change
orders as were approved, in writing, by the Planning
Commission.
[4] All minor change orders permitted by the signatories and
specifically noted on the plans.
(b) Since said certification shall constitute professional liability,
any work objected to by the signatories and not corrected to
their satisfaction by the developer during construction shall be
documented and immediately presented to the Planning
Commission in writing. The Planning Commission will then
notify both the contractor and his bonding company that
failure to immediately correct said deviations will result in both
suspension of the right to continue construction and payment
by the bonding company or from the letter of credit or the cash
deposit of the cost of rectifying said deviation by some other
contractor of the Planning Commission's selection at a cost
acceptable to the Commission. The expense of the
requirements of this subsection shall be borne by the
developer.

Commission valuations. Skillful arrangement of improvements and
their suitable adoption to topography produce both substantial
savings in construction costs and maximum values in the completed
properties.
§ 199-11 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 199-12
199:321
(3) To avoid wasted effort, final development plans should be prepared
by competent professionals but only after the sponsor's preliminary
subdivision plan has been accepted by the local authorities.
(4) If a development is sectioned, the final development plans shall be
prepared separately for each section as construction progresses,
rather than for the entire development at one time. Each
successive section must have sufficient area and proper boundaries
to provide street traffic circulation and satisfactory drainage
without depending upon proposed future construction of other
sections.
B. Custom building. Where land development is for individualized custom
building, the developer's final development plans should show only the
neighborhood improvements for which he is responsible. These are not
only the off-lot improvements but also those on-lot improvements
necessary to make each lot a buildable site independent of other lots.
An example of the latter is rough grading of a block area to establish a
workable pattern for surface drainage.
C. Operative building by others.
(1) Where land development is for the sale of groups of lots to others
for operative building, the land developer's final development plans
are similar to the above for custom building. For these
developments, however, each operative builder furnishes for his
own part of the development a master plot plan.
(2) The master plot plan and master lot grading plan show the
relationship of the improvements on each individual lot to the
street and to adjoining properties. They permit each property to be
studied and adjusted in relation to nearby properties to resolve
potential grading and drainage problems and to obtain a sound,
attractive development. These master plans may be prepared by
adding data directly on translucent prints of the original drawing of
the accepted preliminary subdivision plan, provided that it is at an
appropriate scale, no smaller than one inch equals 50 feet.
(3) All information which is basically the same for each of a number of
properties of a single type should be shown on a single typical plot
plan. However, special lot conditions will always require the
preparation of individualized plot planning data either on the
master plot plan, if its scale permits, or on an enlarged portion of
the master plot plan or on individual plot plans, as required in the
minimum property standards.
D. Development combined with building. Where the same firm does both
the land development and all the home building in the tract, the data
required on the final development plans is the same as outlined above
for operative building by others. Since all is done by the same firm,
however, the data may be prepared either on a series of drawings, as
indicated above, or on a single drawing. The single composite
§ 199-12 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 199-12
199:322
development plan is preferred because it is easier to prepare and
analyze and is more useful during construction and inspection. The
scale shall be one inch equals 50 feet.
E. Special types. The kind and the extent of information to be shown on
the final development plans vary for different developments according
to existing conditions and the characteristics of the development.

drawings. Greater thickness shall be provided as may be required by the
Village Engineer; if greater thickness is to be provided, this will be indicated
prior to final approval of the subdivision.
§ 199-23. Storm sewer system.
A. Laying of pipe for storm sewer.
(1) Description. This item shall consist of laying and backfilling storm
sewer pipe to conform to the type, size lines and grades as shown
on the accepted drawings.
(2) Material. All materials shall be secured from approved sources.
(3) Construction.
(a) Preparation of trenches for pipe-laying.
[1] Pipelines shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the
surface of the street to avoid dangerous pressure of
impact. When this is not possible, special reinforcement
shall be provided.
[2] Trenches shall be only of sufficient width to provide a free
working space on each side of the pipe, and in every case,
there shall be sufficient space between the pipe and the
sides of the trench to make it possible to thoroughly ram
the backfilling around the pipe and to secure tight joints.
[3] Trenches shall be kept free from water until the materials
in the joints, where concrete or clay pipes are used, and
masonry have sufficiently hardened. Where metal pipes
are used, the trenches shall be kept free from water until
the bands have been thoroughly tightened and bolted in
place.
(b) Preparation of foundation for pipe-laying.
[1] The foundation in the trench shall be formed to prevent
any subsequent settlement which might result in excessive
pressure and consequent rupture of the pipes.
[2] If the foundation is rock, an equalizing bed of concrete or
sand, well-compacted, shall be placed upon the rock. The
thickness of these beds shall be not less than four inches.
§ 199-22 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 199-23
199:328
Pipes shall be laid in these beds so that at least the lower
third of each pipe is supported throughout its entire
length.
[3] If the foundation is good firm earth, the earth shall be
pared or mouled to give a full support to the lower third of
each pipe, and if necessary, to secure a proper bearing for
the pipe, a layer of concrete, fine gravel or other suitable
material shall be placed. The same means of securing a
firm foundation shall be adopted in case the excavation
has been made deeper than necessary.
[4] If there is no good natural foundation, the pipes shall be
laid in a concrete cradle supported on a masonry
foundation, carried to a soil of satisfactory bearing power,
or supported on a structure designed to carry the weight
of a pipe and its load to a firm bearing.
(c) Pipe-laying.
[1] The laying of pipes in finished trenches shall be
commenced at the lowest point so that the spigot ends
point in the direction of flow.
[2] All pipes shall be laid with ends abutting and true to line
and grade. They shall be fitted and matched so that, when
laid in the work, they will form a sewer with a smooth and
uniform invert. It is necessary to use all possible care
when shoving the pipes together so that the points will not
be unnecessarily large.
[3] Sockets shall be carefully cleaned before the pipes are
lowered into trenches. The pipes shall be so lowered as to
avoid unnecessary handling in the trench.
[4] The joints shall be set firmly according to line and grade
and joined together in such a manner that they will be
structurally sound and watertight.
(d) Backfilling trenches.
[1] All trenches and excavations shall be backfilled
immediately after the pipes are laid unless other
protection of the pipe is necessary. The backfilling material
shall be selected and deposited with special reference to
the future safety of the pipes. Clean earth, sand or
rockdust shall be solidly tamped about the pipes up to a
level of at least two feet above the top of the pipes. This
material shall be carefully deposited in uniform layers.
Unless otherwise permitted, each layer shall be carefully
and solidly tamped or rammed with proper tools so as not
to injure or disturb the pipeline.
§ 199-23 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 199-23
199:329
[2] Puddling or water flooding for consolidating the backfilling
is recommended only for sandy and gravelly materials. If
this method is used, the first flooding shall be applied after
the backfilling has been compacted by tamping up to two
feet above the top of the pipes and the second flooding
applied during or after the subsequent filling of the trench.
An excess of water shall be avoided in order to prevent
disturbance of the earth under and around the pipes and
also to prevent an undue excess of pressure upon them.
[3] Walking or working on the completed pipeline, except as
may be necessary in tamping or backfilling, shall not be
permitted until the trench has been backfilled to a height
of at least two feet over the top of the pipes. The filling of
the trench shall be carried on simultaneously on both sides
of the pipes in such manner that injurious side pressures
do not occur.
(e) Seasonal limits. No construction shall be done during
unfavorable weather conditions.
B. Manholes and catch basins.
(1) Description. This item shall consist of the construction of manholes
and catch basins and all necessary appurtenances and shall
conform with the details as shown on the accepted drawings. The
work shall include all necessary excavation for the structures and
their appurtenances; the construction of all foundations; all brick,
concrete, stone and timber work; the setting in place of all iron
work; and the refilling of all trenches and any other work necessary
for their completion.
(2) Materials. All materials shall be secured from approved sources. All
metal castings shall conform with the American Society for Testing
and Materials standards.
(3) Construction.
(a) Excavation. Excavation shall be made to the required depth,
and the base upon which the manhole or catch basin is to be
constructed shall be compacted to a firm even surface.
(b) Forms. For cast-in-place concrete structures, steel or wooden
forms shall be used. The forms shall be braced and wired in
such a manner that they will not give or warp under the
pressure and loads contemplated in pouring the concrete. The
concrete shall be tamped or spaded into place in such a
manner as to eliminate honeycombing.
(c) Casting and slabs.
§ 199-23 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 199-23
199:330
§ 199-24. Sanitary sewer system.
[1] Cast-iron or other metal frames shall be set on full mortar
beds composed of one part portland cement and two parts
of fine aggregate.
[2] Concrete slabs shall be separated from the remainder of
the structure by four-ply roofing paper separators at all
points of contact.
(d) Brickwork.
[1] All bricks for brick structures shall be thoroughly wet by
immersion immediately before laying. Every brick must be
thoroughly laid in full mortar joints on the bottom side and
end, which for each brick must be formed by one
operation. In no case are the joints to be made by grouting
or by working in mortar after laying the brick. No joints
shall exceed three-eighths (3/8) inch in thickness. All joints
on faces shall be trowel-struck.
[2] All unfinished brick masonry must be racked back or
toothed, and when new work is joined to the unfinished
portion, the latter must be thoroughly cleaned.
[3] Brick masonry of sides and arches shall be bonded and
keyed, special care being exercised with each ring against
two large joints at the back. All joints shall be normal to
the section, and all lipping of brick must be carefully
avoided.
(e) Pipe setting. Sections of connection pipe shall be incorporated
into the construction and placed at the elevation, direction and
grade required. The inner ends of the pipe shall be flush with
the inner faces of the walls. Inlet and outlet pipe shall be of the
size and kind and meet the same requirements as the pipe with
which it is to be connected. Pipe placed in masonry for inlet or
outlet connections shall extend through the walls and beyond
the outside surfaces of the walls a sufficient distance to allow
for connections, and masonry shall be carefully constructed
around it so as to prevent leakage around its outer surfaces.
(f) Seasonal limits. No construction shall be done during
unfavorable weather conditions.
(g) Concrete block manholes and catch basins. See Subsection
B(3)(d) for the same procedure in construction.
(h) Cast-iron covers and grates. To be as described and be set
evenly and firm in their frames so that no rocking will occur
under loading.

Additional Regulations for Major Subdivisions
§ 199-29. Reservation of land for park, playground or other
recreational purposes.
A. Before the Planning Commission may approve a subdivision plat
containing residential units, such subdivision plat shall also show, when
required by such Commission, a park or parks suitably located for
playground or other recreational purposes. Such park or parks shall
contain no less than 10% of the gross land area of the subdivision.
B. Land for park, playground or other recreational purposes may not be
required until the Planning Commission has made a finding that a
proper case exists for requiring that a park or parks be suitably located
for playgrounds or other recreational purposes within the village. Such
findings shall include an evaluation of the present and anticipated
future needs for park and recreational facilities in the village based on
projected population growth to which the particular subdivision plat
will contribute.
C. In the event that the Planning Commission makes a finding pursuant to
Subsection B above that the proposed subdivision plat presents a
proper case for requiring a park or parks suitably located for
playgrounds or other recreational purposes but that a suitable park or
parks of adequate size to meet the requirement cannot be properly
located on such subdivision plat, the Planning Commission shall require
a sum of money in lieu thereof, in an amount to be established by the
Board of Trustees. In making such determination of suitability, the
Commission shall assess the size and suitability of land shown on the
subdivision plat which could be possible locations for park or
recreational facilities, as well as practical factors, including whether
there is a need for additional facilities in the immediate neighborhood.
Any moneys required by the Planning Commission in lieu of land for
park, playground or other recreational purposes pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall be deposited into a trust fund to be used
by the village exclusively for park, playground or other recreational
purposes, including the acquisition of property.
D. Existing features which would add value to residential development,
such as large trees, watercourses, historic spots and similar
irreplaceable assets, should be preserved insofar as possible, through
harmonious designs of the subdivision.
E. The layout of the proposed subdivision shall be in general conformity
with the features or developments proposed in the Master Plan of the
Village of Colonie.
F. All roads, parks and required easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Formal offer of cession to the public of all roads and parks to be offered
to the public shall be filed with the Planning Commission prior to

199:335
§ 199-30. Utilities.
As to utilities required by the Planning Commission, the Commission may
accept assurance from each public utility company whose facilities are
proposed to be installed. Such assurance shall be in writing, addressed
to the Commission, stating that such public utility company will make the
installation necessary for the furnishing of its services within a specified
time in accordance with the approved construction detail sheets submitted.
§ 199-31. Construction standards.
Construction standards for all required improvements shall be in
accordance with the standards established by the Village Planning
Commission. The standards shall also conform to the Official Map, as
adopted. Alternate improvement standards may be permitted if the
Planning Commission deems that they are equal or superior in performance
characteristics to the specified improvements.
§ 199-32. Permanent monuments and markers.
Monuments shall be placed so that the scored or marked point shall
coincide exactly with the intersection of the lines to be marked and shall be
set so that the top of the monument or marker is level with the surface of
the surrounding ground.

add, as part of the plat, a notation, if he so desires, to the effect that no
offer of decision of such roads and parks or any of them is made to the
public.
A. Monuments shall be set at the intersection of all lines forming angles in
the boundary of the subdivision.
B. Markers shall be set at the beginning and ending of all curves along
street or highway property lines; at all points where lot lines intersect
curves, either front or rear; at all angles in property lines of lots; and at
all lot corners. Markers shall consist of steel bars at least 15 inches long
and not less than three-fourths (3/4) inch in diameter.
C. Permanent monuments shall be set at block corners and at intervals of
approximately 500 feet or such other distance as the Planning
Commission may determine appropriate, and their location shall be
shown on the subdivision plat. Unless embedded in concrete, iron pipes
shall not be considered permanent monuments for the purpose of these
regulations. Permanent monuments shall be set to prevent their
movement due to normal frost upheaval pressures and movements.
A. The developer shall be required by the Planning Commission to carry
away, by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface water that may exist

§ 199-34. Sanitary sewer improvements.
either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road rights-of-way, where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
B. A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage
area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The subdivider's
engineer shall determine the necessary size of the facility, based on
conditions of total potential development and guidelines of the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The developer
shall submit to the Planning Commission three copies of computations
and data in sufficient detail to make possible the ready determination of
the adequacy of the proposed drainage installation.
C. The subdivider's engineer shall also study the effect of each subdivision
on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the
subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to
the development of the subdivision will produce downstream flows
which will exceed the guidelines of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation, in such case the Planning Commission
shall not approve the subdivision until provision has been made for the
improvement of said potential condition.
(1) Lots shall be laid out and graded to provide positive drainage away
from buildings.
(2) Culverts and related installations shall be provided to:
(a) Permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
(b) Ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the line of
streets.
(3) In the design of storm installations, special consideration shall be
given to avoidance of problems which may arise from concentration
of stormwater runoff over adjacent properties.
A. The developer shall be required by the Planning Commission to pipe
such location or locations as the Planning Commission may require all
present or future sanitary sewage generated within or tributary to his
development, as determined by the Planning Commission.
B. All pipe and appurtenances shall, in each case, be of sufficient size to
accommodate such flows as will be developed by the design
requirements established by the Superintendent and/or the Albany
County Department of Health and meeting the approval of the Planning
Commission. The developer shall submit to the Planning Commission
for review and approval three sets of computations and data in
sufficient detail to make possible the ready determination of the
adequacy of the proposed system.
§ 199-33 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 199-34
199:337
§ 199-35. Release of bonds; maintenance bond.
All bonds, letters of credit or cash required under these regulations will
be released by the Planning Commission after certification by the Village
Engineer that the work covered by the bond, letter of credit or cash has
been satisfactorily completed, except that 10% of the original amount shall
be retained for a period of two years to cover repairs to the work covered
by the original bond, etc., including replacement of trees required by the
Planning Commission. The requirement to replace trees shall be enforced
by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer. The remaining 10%, or as much
of it as is left over after paying for any repairs or replacements during
the period of retainage, will be released by the Planning Commission on
recommendation of the Village Engineer after the expiration of the two-year
retainage period.
C. The Planning Commission reserves the right to reject any proposed
development which will exceed the capacity of the downstream system.
D. Where the required system or any part thereof cannot be
accommodated within the right-of-way of any presently existing or
proposed street or road, the developer shall provide an unrestricted
easement in perpetuity extending a minimum of 15 feet on either side of
such system or part thereof.

Utility Tax
[Adopted 8-28-1995 by L.L. No. 2-1995]
§ 207-1. Imposition of tax.
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 5-530 of the Village Law of the State
of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after the first
day of January 1959, is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business
in the Village of Colonie, which is subject to the supervision of the State
Department of Public Service and which has a gross income for the 12
months ending December 31 in excess of $500, except motor carriers or
brokers subject to such supervision under Article 3-b of the Public Service
Law;31 and a tax equal to 1% of its gross operating income from and after
the first day of January 1959, is hereby imposed upon every utility doing
business in the Village of Colonie which has a gross operating income for
the 12 months ending December 31 in excess of $500, which taxes shall
have application only within the territorial limits of the Village of Colonie
and shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees imposed by any
other provision of law. Such taxes shall not be imposed on any transaction
originating or consummated outside of the territorial limits of the Village
of Colonie, notwithstanding that some act is necessarily performed with
respect to such transaction within such limits.
§ 207-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
GROSS INCOME  Includes receipts received in or by reason of any
sale, conditional or otherwise (except sales hereinafter referred to with
respect to which it is provided that profits from the sale shall be included
in gross income), made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or
use by the purchaser in the Village of Colonie, including cash, credits
and property of any kind or nature (whether or not such sale is made or
such service is rendered for profit), without any deduction therefrom on
account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of materials used, labor
or service or other costs, interest or discount paid or any other expense
whatsoever; provided, however, that "gross income" with respect to the
sale of telephony or telegraphy or the furnishing of telephone or telegraph
service shall include receipts received in or by reason of all sales made
or service furnished in the Village of Colonie (whether or not for ultimate
consumption or use by the purchaser); but if telephony, including carrier
access service, or telegraphy which is sold in the Village of Colonie by a
utility or telephone service, including carrier access service, or telegraph
service which is furnished in the Village of Colonie by a utility is then
resold by the purchaser with respect to such a sale, there shall be allowed
31.Editor's Note: Article 3-b of the Public Service Law was repealed by L. 1970, c. 267. For
current provisions, see § 240 of the Transportation Law.
§ 207-1 SWIMMING POOLS § 207-2
203:353
a deduction from the receipts of such purchaser from the resale of the
amount paid to his seller or furnisher for such telephony or telegraphy or
telephone or telegraph service. For the purpose of such deduction, the fact
that an interexchange carrier which has purchased carrier access service
for resale is not able to specifically identify and separate the portion of
such service which was actually resold in a particular sale of telephone
service to its customers shall not be grounds to disallow such deductions.
"Gross income" also includes profits from the sale of securities; also profits
from the sale of real property growing out of the ownership or use of or
interest in such property; also profits from the sale of personal property
(other than property of a kind which would properly be included in the
inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the period for which
a return is made); also receipts from interest, dividends and royalties
derived from sources within the Village of Colonie other than such as are
received from a corporation, a majority of whose voting stock is owned
by the taxpaying utility, without any deduction therefrom for any expenses
whatsoever incurred in connection with the receipt thereof; also profits
from any transaction (except sales for resale and rentals) within the Village
of Colonie whatsoever.
GROSS OPERATING INCOME  Includes receipts received in or by reason
of any sale, conditional or otherwise, made for ultimate consumption or use
by the purchaser of gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony
or telegraphy or in or by reason of the furnishing for such consumption
or use of gas, electric, steam, water, refrigeration, telephone or telegraph
service in the Village of Colonie, including cash, credits and property of
any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom on account of the
cost of the property sold, the cost of material used, labor or services or
other costs, interest or discount paid or any other expenses whatsoever;
provided, however, that "gross operating income" with respect to the sale
of telephony or telegraphy or the furnishing of telephone or telegraph
service shall include receipts received in or by reason of all sales made
or service furnished in the Village of Colonie (whether or not for ultimate
consumption or use by the purchaser); but, if telephony, including carrier
access service, or telegraphy which is sold in the Village of Colonie by a
utility or telephone service, including carrier access service, or telegraph
service which is furnished in the Village of Colonie by a utility is then resold
by the purchaser with respect to such a sale, there shall be allowed a
deduction from the receipts of such purchaser from the resale of the amount
paid to his seller or furnisher for such telephony or telegraphy or telephone
or telegraph service. For the purpose of such deduction, the fact that an
interexchange carrier which has purchased carrier access service for resale
is not able to specifically identify and separate the portion of such service
which was actually resold in a particular sale of telephone service to its
customers shall not be grounds to disallow such deductions.
INTEREXCHANGE CARRIER  Includes any seller of telephone service
between two or more exchanges that qualifies as a common carrier within
the meaning of Subsection H § 153 of Title 47 of the United States Code or,
if performing intrastate telephone service only, that would otherwise qualify
§ 207-2 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 207-2
203:354
but for the fact that it was not engaged in providing interstate or foreign
telephone service.
PERSON  Persons, corporations, companies, associations, joint-stock
associations, copartnerships, estates, assignees of rents, any person acting
in a fiduciary capacity or any other entity and persons, their assignees,
lessees, trustees or receivers appointed by any court whatsoever or by any
other means except the state, municipalities, political and civil subdivisions
of the state or municipality, public districts and corporations and
associations organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable or
educational purposes, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the
benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
UTILITY  Includes every person subject to the supervision of the State
Department of Public Service, except persons engaged in the business of
operating on the public highways of the Village of Colonie one or more
omnibuses having a seating capacity of more than seven persons and
persons engaged in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor
railroad cars or of operating railroads other than street surface, rapid
transit, subway and elevated railroads; and also includes every person
(whether or not such person is subject to such supervision) who sells gas,
electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy delivered
through mains, pipes or wires or who furnishes gas, electric, steam, water,
refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service by means of mains, pipes or
wires, regardless of whether such activities are the main business of such
person or are only incidental thereto or whether use is made of the public
streets.
§ 207-3. Maintenance of records.
Every utility subject to tax under this Article shall keep such records of
its business and in such form as the Village Treasurer may require, and
such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the
Village Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or may
require that they be kept longer.
§ 207-4. Filing of returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before March 15
of each year, a return for the year ended on the preceding December
31, including any period for which the tax imposed hereby or by any
amendment hereof is effective. Every return shall state the gross income
or gross operating income for the period covered thereby. Returns shall
be filed with the Village Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for
such purpose and shall contain such other data, information or matter as
he may require to be included therein. The Village Treasurer, in order to
ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time a further or
supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be specified
by him; and he may require any utility doing business in the Village of
Colonie to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by
him, regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this Article.
§ 207-2 SWIMMING POOLS § 207-4
203:355
Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility
making the same or of the owner or of a copartner thereof or of a principal
officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by the corporation,
to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 207-5. Tax payable with return.
At the time of filing a return as required by this Article, each utility shall
pay to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed by this Article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 207-6. Failure to submit acceptable return.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from the Village Treasurer or if no return is made for any period, the
Village Treasurer shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the
tax on the basis of external indexes or otherwise. The Village Treasurer
shall give notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax.
Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the
person against whom it is assessed shall, within one year after the
giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer
for a hearing or unless the Village Treasurer, of his own motion, shall
reduce the same. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give
notice of his decision to the person liable for the tax. Any final
determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall be
reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Laws
and Rules, if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within
90 days after the giving of the notice of such final determination;
provided, however, that any such proceeding under said Article 78 shall
not be instituted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with such interest and penalties hereon as may be provided for by local
law, ordinance or resolution, shall be first deposited and an undertaking
filed in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed or
the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of filing of a return;
provided, however, that where no return has been filed as required by
this Article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 207-4 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 207-7
203:356
§ 207-7. Available remedies.
The same remedies shall be available for the recovery of any tax or penalty
imposed by this Article as are available for the other taxes and penalties
imposed by law.
§ 207-8. Giving of notice.
Any notice authorized or requested under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this Article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this Article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 207-9. Penalties for failure to pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this Article, shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village Treasurer,
for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 207-10. Refunds.
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall
determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously
or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be
so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no refund shall
be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Village
Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have reduced
the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a certiorari proceeding
that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made
out of moneys collected under this Article, deposited to the credit of the
Village Treasurer, with the approval of the Village Treasurer. An application
for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application
for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village
Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After
making his determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to
the person interested. Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been
§ 207-7 SWIMMING POOLS § 207-10
203:357
erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the
refund thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers and such
officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
such determination shall be reviewable by a proceeding under Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Laws and Rules; provided, however, that such proceeding
is instituted within 90 days after the giving of the notice of such denial,
that a final determination of tax due was not previously made and that an
undertaking is filed with the proper fiscal officer or officers in such amount
and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve,
to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed,
the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the
prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 207-11. Tax to be part of operating cost.
The tax imposed by this Article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 207-12. Action to enforce payment.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
Article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 207-13. Administration.
In the administration of this Article, the Village Treasurer shall have power
to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law,
as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of
his duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his
official duty under this Article and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 207-14. Disposition of moneys.
All taxes and penalties received by the Village Treasurer under this Article
shall be paid into the treasury of the Village and shall be credited to and
deposited in the general fund of the Village.
§ 207-15. Remedy provisions to be exclusive.
The remedy provided by this Article for review of a decision of the Village
Treasurer shall be the exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer to

[Adopted 8-28-1995 by L.L. No. 2-1995]
§ 207-18. Grant of exemption.
An improvement to any real property used solely for residential purposes
as a one-, two- or three-family residence shall be exempt from taxation to
the extent of any increase in value attributable to such improvement if such
improvement is used for the purpose of facilitating and accommodating the
use and accessibility of such real property by a resident owner of the real
property who is physically disabled or a member of the resident owner's
household who is physically disabled if such member resides in the real
property. Such exemption shall be applicable to improvements constructed
prior to the effective date herein.
§ 207-19. Qualification.
To qualify as physically disabled for the purposes of this Article, an
individual shall submit to the Board of Review a certified statement from
a physician licensed to practice in the state on a form prescribed and
made available by the State Board, which states that the individual has
a permanent physical impairment which substantially limits one or more
of such individual's major life activities, except that an individual who has
obtained a certificate from the State Commission for the Blind and Visually
Handicapped stating that such individual is legally blind may submit such
certificate in lieu of a physician's certified statement.
§ 207-20. Application.
A. Such exemption shall be granted only upon application by the owner or
all of the owners of the real property on a form prescribed and made
available by the State Board. The applicant shall furnish such
information as the Board shall require. The application shall be filed,
together with the appropriate certified statement of physical disability
or certificate of blindness, with the Board of Review of the Village on or
before the taxable status date of such Village.
B. If the Board of Review is satisfied that the improvement is necessary to
facilitate and accommodate the use and accessibility by a resident who
is physically disabled and that the applicant is entitled to an exemption
pursuant to this article, the Board of Review shall approve the
application and enter the taxable assessed value of the parcel for which
an exemption has been granted pursuant to this article on the
assessment roll with the taxable property, with the amount of the
exemption as determined pursuant to § 207-18 of this article in a
separate column. Once granted, the exemption shall continue on the
real property until the improvement ceases to be necessary to facilitate
and accommodate the use and accessibility of the property by the
resident who is physically disabled.

A. Title to that portion of real property owned by a cooperative apartment
corporation in which a tenant-stockholder of such corporation resides,
and which is represented by his share or shares of stock in such
corporation as determined by its or their proportional relationship to
the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including that owned by
the corporation, shall be deemed to be vested in such tenantstockholder.
B. That proportion of the assessment of such real property owned by a
cooperative apartment corporative determined by the relationship of
such real property vested in such tenant-stockholder to such entire
parcel and the buildings thereon owned by such cooperative apartment
corporation in which such tenant-stockholder resides shall be subject to
exemption from taxation pursuant to this section, and any exemption so
granted shall be credited by the appropriate taxing authority against
the assessed valuation of such real property; the reduction in real
property taxes realized thereby shall be credited by the cooperative
apartment corporation against the amount of such taxes otherwise
payable by or chargeable to such tenant-stockholder.
A. If the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of the
property for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of
making application for exemption exceeds the maximum sum
authorized by the provisions of § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law.
"Income tax year" shall mean the twelve-month period for which the
owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return or, if no such
return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the
husband or wife, their combined income may not exceed such sum.
Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits,
interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital
asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a
capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or
§ 207-36 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 207-39
203:378
earnings and net income from self employment, but shall not include
a return of capital, gifts, inheritances, payments made to individuals
because of their status as victims of Nazi persecution, as defined in
P.L. 103-286, or monies earned through employment in the federal
foster grandparent program, and any such income shall be offset by all
medical and prescription drug expenses actually paid which were not
reimbursed or paid for by insurance. The provisions of this subsection
notwithstanding, such income shall not include veterans' disability
compensation, as defined in Title 38 of the United States Code. In
computing net rental income and net income from self-employment, no
depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and
tear of real or personal property held for the production of income.
B. Unless the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or
one of the owners of the property for at least 12 consecutive months
prior to the date of making application for exemption; provided,
however, that in the event of the death of either husband or wife in
whose name title of the property shall have been vested at the time of
death and then becomes vested solely in the survivor by virtue of devise
by or descent from the deceased husband or wife, the times of
ownership of the property by the deceased husband or wife shall be
deemed also a time of ownership by the survivor, and such ownership
shall be deemed continuous for the purpose of computing such period
of 12 consecutive months; provided, further, that in the event of a
transfer by either a husband or wife to the other spouse of all or part of
the title to the property, the time of ownership of the property by the
transferor spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the
transferee spouse and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for
the purposes of computing such period of 12 consecutive months; and
provided, further, that where property of the owner or owners has been
acquired to replace property formerly owned by such owner or owners
and taken by eminent domain or other involuntary proceeding, except a
tax sale, the period of ownership of the former property shall be
combined with the period of ownership of the property for which the
application is made for exemption, and such periods of ownership shall
be deemed to be consecutive for the purposes of this section. Where a
residence is sold and replaced with another within one year and is in
the same assessing unit or municipality, the period of ownership of the
former property shall be combined with the period of ownership of the
replacement residence and deemed consecutive for exemption from
taxation by each such assessing unit or municipality. Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, where a residence is sold and replaced with
another within one year and both residents are within the state, the
period of ownership of both properties shall be deemed consecutive for
the exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting
such exemption. Where the owner or owners transfer title to property
which as of the date of transfer was exempt from taxation under the
provisions of this section, the reacquisition of title by such owner or
owners within nine months of the date of transfer shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirement of this subsection that the title of the property
§ 207-39 SWIMMING POOLS § 207-39
203:379
§ 207-40. Application process; denial notice; renewal applications.
shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners for such
period of 12 consecutive months. Where, upon or subsequent to the
death of an owner or owners, title to property, which as of the date of
such death was exempt from taxation under such provisions, becomes
vested, by the virtue of devise or descent from the deceased owner or
owners, or by transfer by any other means within nine months after
such death, solely in a person or persons who, at the time of such death,
maintained such property as a primary residence, the requirement of
this subsection that the title of the property shall have been vested
in the owner or one of the owners for such period of 12 consecutive
months shall be deemed satisfied.
C. Unless the property is used executively for residential purposes;
provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not
so used exclusively for residential purposes but is used for other
purposes, such portion shall be subject to taxation and the remaining
portion only shall be entitled to the exemption provided by this article.
D. Unless the real property is the legal residence and is occupied, in whole
or in part, by the owner or by all of the owners of the property, except
where an owner is absent from the residence while receiving healthrelated
care as an inpatient of a residential heath-care facility, as
defined in § 2801 of the Public Health Law, provided that any income
accruing to that person shall only be income only to the extent that it
exceeds the amount paid by such owner, spouse, or co-owner for care in
the facility and provided, further, that during such confinement such
property is not occupied by other than the spouse or co-owner of such
owner; or the real property is owned by a husband and/or wife, or an exhusband
and/or an ex-wife, and either is absent from the residence due
to divorce, legal separation or abandonment and all other provisions of
this article are met, provided that where an exemption was previously
granted when both resided on the property, then the person remaining
on the real property shall be 62 years of age or over.
A. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property, on forms prescribed by the State Board to be
furnished by the appropriate local assessing unit, and shall furnish the
information and be executed in the manner required or prescribed on
such forms, and shall be filed in such Assessor's office on or before the
appropriate taxable status date. Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, any person otherwise qualifying under this section shall not be
denied the exemption under this section if he becomes 65 years of age
after the appropriate taxable status date and on or before December 31
of the same year.
B. At least 60 days prior to the appropriate taxable status date, the
appropriate local assessing unit shall mail to each person who was
granted exemption pursuant to this section on the latest completed
assessment roll an application form and a notice that such application
§ 207-39 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 207-40
203:380
§ 207-41. Penalty for false statement; collection of erroneous

for shared use, the Planning Commission shall require that the
applicant provide an intermunicipal notification for new towers as
follows:
(1) An applicant who proposes a new telecommunications tower in the

and unnecessary hardship, the Planning Commission will send the case
to the Zoning Board of Appeals for waiver or variance of the
requirements of underground installation whenever, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission, such variance or waiver shall not be
detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare. The site plan
applicant desiring such a waiver shall file a written request at the time
the application is added to the Planning Commission agenda, setting
forth why the waiver should be granted.

§ 222-1. Legislative findings; purpose.
The outdoor storage of junked, abandoned, unused or dangerous motor
vehicles or the parts therefrom within the Village of Colonie is a hazard
to the preservation of the public health, welfare and safety in that it
constitutes a health, fire and safety hazard and is an attractive nuisance to
children, which is a peril to their safety. Their outdoor storage constitutes
a blight on the Village's landscape; they are generally unsightly; and their
existence tends to depreciate the value of property in the neighborhood
and the Village. The control of the outdoor storage of junked, abandoned,
unused or dangerous motor vehicles or parts therefrom within the Village
of Colonie is therefore regulated for the preservation of the public health,
safety and welfare of its residents.

planting of trees or for other purposes of this chapter.

Commission or the Zoning Board of Appeals in connection with any site
plan approval, subdivision approval or the granting of a variance.

its use for certain purposes during periods of emergency, as hereinafter
defined, in the interest of public health, safety and welfare.
§ 234-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
EMERGENCY  Covers and includes an actual or threatened shortage of
potable water caused by drought, by the breakdown of the pumping system
or the filtration plant or any part of the distribution system or by a power
shortage or failure, which is part of or which affects the water supply of the
Village, whether or not under the control of the Village, by contamination of
water being supplied to customers, by the declaration of a civil defense alert
or by any other similar occurrence deemed by the Village Board to justify
its action as hereinafter set forth.
§ 234-3. Declaration of emergency.
A. Whenever, in the opinion of the Village Board, it becomes necessary,
because of the existence of an emergency as hereinbefore defined, to
conserve the water supply of said Village by limiting, restricting or
prohibiting its use, the Village Board may, at a regular or special
meeting thereof, adopt a resolution declaring such emergency.
B. Such resolution may:
(1) Direct the Superintendent of Public Works to prepare a
proclamation prohibiting all users of said water supply within or
outside the Village from using the same or any part thereof for the
sprinkling or irrigation of lawns, ornamental plants, shrubs or trees
or domestic gardens or for washing motor vehicles or limiting such
use to certain hours of the day or certain days of the week; and/or
(2) Direct said Superintendent to prepare a proclamation limiting,
prohibiting or restricting the use of said water by a specified
customer, by specified classes or groups of customers or by
customers located within a certain specified area inside and/or

appropriate resolution, declare that the emergency no longer exists.
§ 234-5. Publication and posting of resolution; exception.
§ 234-6. End of emergency; publication and posting of resolution;
exception.
§ 234-7. Unlawful use of water prohibited.

the emergency previously declared, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm
or corporation having the use of said water supply of said Village to use
any part of the water so supplied for the purpose or purposes described in
said resolution and proclamation or notice in violation of the prohibitions,
limitations or restrictions therein set forth.
A. If such resolution declares a general emergency to exist, such
proclamation shall be published in one newspaper having general
circulation throughout the Village, and copies thereof shall be posted in
at least five public places within the Village.
B. If such resolution declares a local or limited emergency to exist, within
the purview of § 234-3B(2) of this article, and but a small or limited
number of customers are affected thereby, the preparation, publication
and posting of such proclamation may be dispensed with, in which case
the service upon the customers affected by such prohibition, limitation
or restriction of a certified copy of the resolution declaring such
emergency shall be sufficient notice thereof.
A. Upon the Village Board's declaring that an emergency as to which a
proclamation has been published and posted has ceased to exist, as
provided in § 234-4 hereof, a copy of such resolution shall be published
and posted in the manner provided in § 234-5A hereof.

installed by the Village. On meters larger than one inch, all
replacement, repairs and testing shall be done by or at the expense of
the customer. In case of any questions as to maintenance, repairs or
testing, the decision of the Village of Colonie will be final.
E. If a meter furnished by the Village has to be replaced for any cause
which, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Public Works, was the
result of any violation of these rules or of any act or omission by the
customer, the customer will be charged a fee as set by resolution of the
Board of Trustees, from time to time, for the replacement of a threefourths-
inch meter and for the replacement of a one-inch meter.
A. The customer shall install a shutoff valve on the street side of the meter
and leave sufficient space for the meter. Meter connections have male
threads, and plumbing must be so as to receive the meter. A thirteen-

meter. The Village will maintain all meters, up to and including one-inch
size, insofar as ordinary wear and tear are concerned. However, in case
of damage by freezing, hot water or external damage, the customer
shall be liable for the cost of replacement. The Village recommends
the installation of suitable equipment properly located and installed to
prevent backflow of hot water which may cause damage to the meter or
damage to the customer's plumbing. Standard details for meter pits are
available in the Department of Public Works office.
B. No person shall remove or tamper with a water meter installed or
authorized by the Village without authorization by the Village or cause
the flow of water from the main to the meter to bypass the meter. There
shall be no plumbing fixtures, water softeners, etc., tied into the supply
line before the meter, with the exception of one hand valve to facilitate
the replacement of a meter.
A. The Village reserves the right to remove and test its meters in
accordance with the prevailing rules of the Village of Colonie. In case of
a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter, the Village will
test the water meter upon the request of a customer. A fee, payable in
advance of the test, is required. This fee is as set by resolution of the
Board of Trustees, from time to time.
B. For water meters one inch and over, the owner, with authorization from
the Village of Colonie, may remove the meter under Village supervision
and have it tested at a Village-approved facility at his own expense. A
fee is required for supervision. This fee is set by resolution of the Board
of Trustees from time to time.
C. In the event that a meter is found to over-register in excess of 2% at any
flow within the normal test flow limits, the fee will be returned to the
customer; otherwise, it will be retained by the Village.
A. The reading of a duly installed meter showing the amount of water
consumed shall be used for all billing purposes, except where it appears
that the meter has ceased to register or has registered inaccurately.
B. In cases where it is found that a meter has ceased to register or has
registered inaccurately and the percentage of inaccuracy cannot be

customer (owner).
Any customer (owner) may discontinue water service or may have
discontinued service restored by giving the Village written notice not less
than 10 days prior to the date of discontinuance or restoration.
Discontinuance may be accomplished either by closing the shutoff valve or
by disconnecting and removing the meter; the method is at the option of the
customer unless the Superintendent of Public Works requires disconnection
for safety reasons. The fee for either discontinuing or restoring the service
is as set forth by resolution of the Board of Trustees from time to time.
All liabilities for the service charges incurred after the discontinuance date
shall cease.
§ 234-19. Failure in supply.
The Village undertakes to use reasonable care and diligence to provide a
constant supply of water at a reasonable pressure but reserves the right,
at any time, after due notice (unless an emergency occurs), to shut off the
water in its mains for the purpose of making repairs and extensions.

[Adopted 8-28-1995 by L.L. No. 2-1995]
§ 234-24. Purpose.
§ 234-25. General prohibition.
No pipe or fixtures connected with the mains of the Village shall be
connected with pipes or fixtures supplied with water from any other source
nor any apparatus which may endanger the quality of the Village's water
supply, except as specifically permitted or provided for in this article.
§ 234-26. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACCEPTABLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE  An acceptable air gap,
reduced-pressure-zone device or double check-valve assembly as used to
contain potential contamination within a facility.
A. The purpose of this article is to safeguard potable water supplies from
potential contamination by preventing backflow from a water user's
system into the Village public water system. It is the intent of this
article to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazard and to
apply the principle that the degree of protection should be
commensurate with the degree of hazard. Further, it is the intent of the
Village of Colonie to comply with the requirements of New York State
Sanitary Code, Part 5, Section 5-1.31, as amended, which section
mandates the requirement that the suppliers of water protect their
water system in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
Commissioner of Health. These mandated requirements are as set forth
in the Cross-Connection Control Manual, as amended, published by the
New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), and to that extent the
terms, conditions and provisions of the New York State Sanitary Code,
Part 5, Section 5-1.31, as amended, and the Cross-Connection Control
Manual, as amended, are incorporated in this article by reference as if
more fully stated.
B. The following sets forth the devices and regulations which shall be
required:
(1) As a condition to the granting of a permit for a water customer to
introduce water from a source other than the municipal water
supply into the user's water system at the same time the premises
are connected to the municipal water supply.

categories identified herein with respect to backflow prevention.
§ 234-24 VEHICLES, OFF-ROAD § 234-26
229:451
ACCEPTABLE DEVICES  Devices or assemblies found to be acceptable
for containment in New York State in accordance with the NYSDOH
requirements and as listed on the Department's most current list of
acceptable devices. (Refer to Village or New York State Health Department
for current listing.)
AESTHETICALLY OBJECTIONABLE FACILITY  One in which substances
are present which, if introduced into the public water supply system, could
be a nuisance to other water customers but would not adversely affect
human health. Typical examples of such substances are food-grade dyes,
hot water, stagnant water from fire lines in which no chemical additives are
used, etc.
AIR GAP SEPARATION  The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood
level rim of the receptacle. The differential distance shall be at least double
the diameter of the supply pipe. In no case shall the air gap be less than one
inch.
BACKFLOW  The resulting backflow of contaminated, polluted or
otherwise unacceptable quality water from a plumbing fixture or other
customer source(s) into a public water supply system due to a greater
pressure within the customer's water system.
BACKSIPHONAGE  The backflow of contaminated or polluted water or
water of questionable quality from a plumbing fixture or other customer
source(s) into a public water supply system main due to a temporary
negative or subatmospheric pressure within the public water supply system.
CERTIFIED BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE TESTER  An individual
who has successfully completed a NYSDOH approved course in the testing
of backflow prevention devices and has been issued a certificate by the
NYSDOH.
CONTAINMENT  Cross-connection control which isolates the customer's
entire facility from the public water supply system so as to provide the
protection necessary to prevent contamination of the public water supply in
the event of backflow from the customer's facility.
CONTAMINATION  The presence in water of a substance that tends to
degrade its quality.
CROSS-CONNECTION  A physical connection through which a water
supply could be contaminated.
CUSTOMER  A water user served by a public water system.
CUSTOMER'S WATER SYSTEM  The piping used to convey water supplied
by a public water supply system throughout a customer's facility.
DEGREE OF HAZARD  Whether a facility is rated as hazardous,
aesthetically objectionable or nonhazardous.
DOUBLE CHECK-VALVE (DCV) ASSEMBLY, ACCEPTABLE  Two single,
independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves
§ 234-26 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 234-26
229:452
located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the
water tightness of each check valve.
HAZARDOUS FACILITY  One in which substances may be present which,
if introduced into the public water system, would or may endanger or have
an adverse effect on the health of other water customers. Typical examples
are laboratories, sewage treatment plants, chemical plants, hospitals and
mortuaries.
INTERCONNECTION  A joining of two independently operated public
water supply distribution systems.

or regional Health Department Engineer having jurisdiction.
NONHAZARDOUS FACILITY  One which does not require the installation
of an acceptable backflow prevention device.
PLUMBING CONTROL  Prevention and elimination of cross-connections
within the customer's water system by enforcement of building or plumbing
codes.
PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM  A supplier of water, including the
source, treatment works, transmission mains, distribution system and
storage facilities servicing the public.
REDUCED-PRESSURE-ZONE (RPZ) DEVICE, ACCEPTABLE  A minimum
of two independently acting check valves, together with an automatically
operated pressure differential relief valve located between the two check
valves. During normal flow and at the cessation of normal flow, the pressure
between these two check valves shall be less than the upstream (supply)
pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief
valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the
pressure between the check valves at less than the supply pressure. The
unit must include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the
device, and each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks.
SUPPLEMENTARY SUPPLY  Any water source or system, other than the
public water supply, that is available within the water customer's facility.
SUPPLIER OF WATER (WATER SUPPLIER)  The Village of Colonie, Albany
County, New York.
§ 234-27. Requirements.
A. Where protection is required. The water system shall be required to
maintain a degree of protection commensurate with the degree of
hazard regardless of whether the hazard is immediate or potential. To
that extent, the Cross-Connection Control Manual, as amended,
published by NYSDOH shall be used, as a guide, to determine where
protection is required. It shall be the responsibility of the water
customer to provide and maintain such required protection devices,
and such devices shall be of a type acceptable to the NYSDOH.
§ 234-26 VEHICLES, OFF-ROAD § 234-27
229:453
B. Type of protection. The protective device required shall depend on the
degree of hazard as listed below:
(1) At the service connection to any premises where there is an
auxiliary water supply handled in a separate piping system, with no
known cross-connection, the public water supply shall be protected
by an approved reduced-pressure-zone device. If a crossconnection
exists, said cross-connection shall be disconnected
immediately. All auxiliary water supplies shall be a self-contained
separate system.
(2) At the service connection to any premises on which a substance
that would be aesthetically objectionable (but not necessarily
hazardous to health if introduced into the public water supply) is
handled so as to constitute a cross-connection, the public water
supply shall be protected by an approved double check-valve
assembly.
(3) At the service connection to any premises on which a substance of
unusual toxic concentration or danger to health is or may be
handled, but not under pressure, the public water supply shall be
protected by an air gap separation or an approved reducedpressure-
zone backflow prevention device. If an air gap is installed,
it shall be located as close as possible to the property line.
(4) At the service connection to any premises on which any material
dangerous to health or toxic substance and toxic concentration is
or may be handled under pressure, the public water supply shall be
protected by an air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as
close as practical to the water meter, and any piping between the
water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible. If these
conditions cannot reasonably be met, the public water supply shall
be protected with an approved reduced-pressure-zone backflow
prevention device, and it shall be located as close as possible to the
property line.
(5) At the service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage
pumping station, the public water supply shall be protected by an
air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as
practicable to the water meter, and all piping between the water
meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible. If these
conditions cannot be reasonably met, the public water supply shall
be protected by an approved reduced-pressure-zone backflow
prevention device, and it shall be located as close as possible to the
property line.
(6) All lawn sprinklers and/or irrigation systems shall be installed with
an approved double check-valve installed as close as possible to the
water meter. If the lawn sprinkler and/or irrigation system includes
a chemical injection feed pump or similar system, then an approved
reduced-pressure-zone backflow prevention device will be required
§ 234-27 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 234-27
229:454
§ 234-28. Design and installation.
and shall be installed as close as possible to the water meter. (The
protection devices, when practical and with the approval of the
Superintendent of Public Works, may be installed within the branch
piping as close to the services connection as possible.)
C. Frequency of inspection of protective devices. It shall be the duty of the
water user on any premises on account of which backflow protective
devices are installed to have competent inspections made at least once
a year or more often in instances where successive inspections indicate
repeated failure. Devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at
the expense of the water user whenever they are found to be defective.
These tests shall be performed by a certified backflow prevention
device tester, and all test results shall be provided to the water user and
Village within 72 hours after the test is made. Records of such tests,
repairs and overhaul shall also be kept and made available to the water
user, the Village and the Local Health Department upon request.
A. Responsibility for design.
(1) The design of backflow prevention device installations is
considered a project involving the safeguarding of life, health and
property. As such, a New York registered professional engineer or
New York State licensed architect must design the installation.
(2) The Village Engineer may be requested to design the installation, in
which case the fee for said design shall be billed to the crossconnection
permit applicant by the Village.
B. Installation: general considerations.
(1) In general, backflow prevention devices must be protected against
freezing and must be accessible for testing and maintenance.
(2) Pit installations are acceptable. However, in the case of RPZ, a pit
installation is usually not feasible since a gravity drain must be
provided which cannot be connected directly to a sewer. No direct
connection to the RPZ device for the purpose of drainage is
permitted. The gravity drain from a RPZ installation shall be
designed for the greatest discharge possible from the device.
(3) All devices must be installed so that they are not subject to
flooding.
(4) In certain instances, backflow prevention devices installed in
parallel on a service line may be needed to meet the needs of a
facility. Such instances are:
(a) Where the water service line to be protected is greater than 10
inches, branching the line and installing parallel devices may
be utilized.
§ 234-27 VEHICLES, OFF-ROAD § 234-28
229:455
§ 234-29. Permit submission and approval.
(b) Where the facility requires continuous water service, a parallel
installation will allow for removing one device at a time from
service for testing and maintenance.
(c) Where dual service for fire flow requirements is necessary.
(5) In no case may the installation of a backflow prevention device
include unprotected bypass piping. Closed gate valves on the
bypass do not constitute protection.
C. Installation details: double check-valve assemblies and reducedpressure-
zone devices.
(1) Double check-valve assembly (DCV). The device does not require
any special installation precautions except to protect the unit from
freezing and ensure that the test cocks are accessible. Adequate
access to the test cocks shall be provided to facilitate required
testing. Normal maintenance consideration shall be satisfied.
(2) Reduced-pressure-zone device (RPZ). This device must also be
protected against freezing, and the test codes shall be positioned to
facilitate testing.
(3) Normal maintenance considerations shall also be satisfied.
(4) The improper installation of these devices can negate the desired
protection. Most critical is the need to provide a gravity drain large
enough to receive the maximum potential discharge of the relief
valve. The drain shall not be subject to flooding and shall be
screened.
A. Forms. The following forms, latest revision, and procedures shall be
utilized (forms may be secured from the Village of Colonie or NYSDOH):
(1) DOH-347: New York State Department of Health application for
approval of backflow prevention device(s).
(2) GEN-237: New York State Department of Health certificate of
approval for backflow prevention device(s).
(3) DOH-1013: Report of testing and maintenance of backflow
prevention device(s).

§ 237-1. Obstruction or diversion prohibited.
The natural and usual flow of water in the watercourses running or passing
through the village shall not be diverted, impeded, obstructed, disturbed,
molested or otherwise affected, unless a permit therefor shall have been
issued by the Superintendent of Public Works, nor shall any earthmoving,
grading or lumbering operations or removal of vegetation (except what is
incidental to routine maintenance) be undertaken which has the potential
of affecting water flow or water quality in any watercourse, unless a permit
therefor shall have been issued by the Superintendent of Public Works.
Before a permit is issued, the person proposing to do work which is covered
by this chapter, as defined above, shall submit an application to the
Superintendent of Public Works together with plans and a fee in an amount
set by the Board of Trustees by resolution from time to time; in addition,
the applicant shall be responsible for any expenses incurred by the village
in the review of the plans. The plans shall show the nature and extent of
the proposed work and how it will or may affect the natural and usual
flow of water; the plans and/or supporting documentation shall also show
the potential affect of the proposed work on water quantity or quality
as well as how any (potential) adverse effects are to be mitigated. The
Superintendent shall modify submitted plans where he believes this is
necessary or reasonably required to preserve the capacity of watercourses
to carry runoff, to prevent siltation or erosion and to reduce the dangers of
flooding. If he is satisfied that these conditions have been met, he may issue
a permit. All work shall conform to the plans as modified and any conditions
of the permit. The construction or maintenance or use of any structure,
device or thing which shall divert, impede, obstruct, disturb, molest or
otherwise affect the flow of such water or the execution of any earthmoving,
grading or lumbering operations or removal of vegetation (except what is
incidental to routine maintenance) without having procured such permit is
hereby prohibited.
§ 237-2. Patroon Creek drainageway established.

A. The Patroon Creek drainageway shall extend on both sides of the
northeast branch of the Patroon Creek from the point where the creek
enters the village at the boundary with the Town of Colonie to the point
where the creek crosses Lincoln Avenue. The width shall be 100 feet,
measured 50 feet on each side from the center line of the creek itself, at
low water. If the bed of the creek is moved, the limits of the
drainageway shall be moved accordingly.
B. The land within the drainageway shall be made available to the village
in the form of a permanent easement to enable the village to undertake
protective measures to reduce erosion and flooding, to erect necessary
structures and to provide access in order to promote the objectives of
this section.
C. The land shall be made available when and if the owner applies for a
permit to build on his land in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
242, Zoning, or for a permit under § 237-1 which involves the
construction of any structure which shall divert, impede, obstruct or
otherwise affect the flow of water.
D. Until such time as a permit has been granted, no structure or building
shall be erected and no earthmoving, grading or lumbering operations
or removal of vegetation (except what is incidental to routine
maintenance) shall be carried out within the drainageway, nor shall any
earthmoving, grading or lumbering operations or removal of vegetation
(except what is incidental to routine maintenance) or any other activity
be undertaken in the vicinity of the drainageway which has the
potential of affecting water flow, water quality, flora or fauna or has the
potential of causing erosion or siltation in the Patroon Creek or has the
potential of adversely affecting the flora, fauna, amenity or utility in the
Patroon Creek or its drainageway. Violation of this provision shall be
considered a violation under § 237-3.
E. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, the land within the
limits of the Patroon Creek drainageway may be counted towards the
required area of a lot, green space or buffer strip to calculate permitted
lot coverage or dwelling units as if there were no requirements to make
this land available to the village.
A. This chapter shall be enforced by the Chief Code Enforcement Officer
or by the Town of Colonie police.
B. Any person violating any provisions of this chapter shall be punished by
a fine of not more than $250 and/or imprisonment for not more than 15

The Planning Commission may consider and approve
provisions for parking in connection with a restaurant serving
alcoholic beverages which are less than the requirements
of this subsection only if it has been demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission on the basis of
studies of comparable restaurants in comparable locations
that such lesser provision of parking spaces will satisfy the
objectives of § 242-8C(1) above.
(g) Medical services: one parking space for every 150 square feet
of floor area.
(h) Unspecified uses: one parking space for each 100 square feet
of floor area, unless the Planning Commission determines that
§ 242-8 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 242-8
237:490
a different ratio is appropriate for the specific use(s) being
applied for on the basis of recent studies or other evidence the
Planning Commission deems locally applicable.
(i) Combined uses [buildings containing two or more use
classifications as defined by Subsection C(2)(a) through (h)]:
parking requirements determined on the basis of the
percentage of floor area per classification of total floor area
plus the sum of mandated spaces. The Planning Commission
may reduce this requirement by not more than 50% of the
lessor (or least) number of spaces if it finds that one of the uses
will generate parking demand only at times when the other
use(s) will generate no, or minimal, parking.
(3) No driveway may be connected to a curb cut which is closer than
200 feet from the boundary of a residential district unless the
parcel on the opposite side of the street is zoned Commercial A and
actually used for a purpose other than residential.
D. Height, yard, density and green space requirements.
(1) No structure or building shall exceed 40 feet or three stories in
height.

provided on each lot, and no building, structure or addition thereto
shall encroach into any required yard:
(a) Front yard: 25 feet.
(b) Side yard, when interior lot is used for residential purposes: a
minimum of 10 feet on each side but a total of 25 feet for both
sides, except that where the side line abuts a residential
district and the interior lot is used for commercial purposes,
then the side yard for that section of the side lot line shall be 50
feet. [Amended 4-13-1998 by L.L. No. 4-1998]
(c) Side yard, corner lot: 25 feet adjoining any street line.
(d) Rear yard:
[1] Ten feet if the adjoining property is zoned commercial and
occupied by a nonresidential use or is vacant.
[2] Twenty-five feet in all other cases.
(e) If a building or structure exceeds two stories or 25 feet in
height, each of the minimum yards specified in Subsection
D(2)(a) through (d) above will be increased by 10 feet for each
additional story or each additional 12 feet in height by which
the building exceeds two stories or 25 feet, respectively,
whichever will result in the greater yard.

237:491
(3) Coverage. The total building area of buildings on the lot (including
accessory buildings, garages or sheds) shall not exceed 50% of the
lot area.

purposes or is in a residential district, a buffer area shall be
provided along the common property line, which shall be not less
than 25 feet in width. The buffer strip shall be covered with natural
or newly planted vegetation at least six feet high with a six-foot
fence along the property line; where topographically feasible, the
Planning Commission will require a berm; natural features shall be
preserved and enhanced as far as possible.

Commercial A District which is intended to be placed within 500
feet of the westerly side of Rapple Drive, provided that it is more
than 300 feet south of the southerly line of the Albany-Schenectady
Road. Any permit to be issued for construction within the above
district must require adequate screening by means of appropriate
fencing, trees or hedges so that the residential values of the homes
on Rapple Drive shall remain unaffected and undisturbed as much
as possible. The Planning Commission shall determine the kind,
amount and nature of such screening after a public hearing.
E. Special provision for lots fronting on certain streets. The intent of this
provision is to promote the orderly development of the Commercial A

of the Village. These standards are intended, among other
things, to prevent:
[1] The creation or emission of offensive or objectionable
noise, odor, vibration or glare noticeable at or beyond the
property line.
[2] Any activity or use creating a physical hazard by reason of
fire, explosion, radiation or similar damage to persons or
property in the same or any nearby district.
[3] The discharge of any liquid or solid materials or waste,
resulting from any activity, into any stream or body of
water or any public or private disposal system or into the
ground that may cause contamination of any water.
[4] The storage of any material, either indoors or outdoors, in
such a manner that it facilitates the breeding of vermin,
destroys the natural environment or endangers health in
any way.
[5] The emission of smoke, fly ash or dust which can cause
damage to the health of persons, animals or plant life or to
other forms of property.
(b) The Planning Commission shall interpret the level or degree
which determines an item to be offensive, objectionable or

§ 242-10 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 242-10
237:498
state and federal standards but shall not be restricted by the
same. It may base its interpretation on more stringent
requirements as it may deem necessary or desirable to
promote the health, safety and general welfare of the Village.
(2) Performance standards.
(a) General standards. The following general standards are hereby
adopted for the control of all permitted uses in the Commercial
D District. Any use shall not be permitted, established,
maintained or conducted therein which shall cause or result in:
[1] Excessive smoke, fumes, odor, dust or any other
atmospheric pollutant beyond the boundaries of the lot
whereon such use is located. Smoke is excessive when the
shade or appearance of such smoke is darker than No. 2 on
the Ringelmann Smoke Chart published by the United
States Bureau of Mines.
[2] Noise louder than the ambient noise level at any lot
boundary of the lot occupied by such use causing the
same. In no case shall the noise level exceed 65 dBA
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. or 50 dBA
between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. as measured
from any property in a residential district. Noise generated
by any motor vehicle or other movable source shall be
considered a noise generated by a use on the lot, as long as
the source of noise is located on the lot occupied by the
use in question.
[3] Pollution resulting from the discharge of any waste
material whatsoever into any watercourse, open ditch or
land surface.
[4] Discharge of any waste material whatsoever into any
sanitary disposal system or sewerage system, except as in
accordance with such rules and regulations of the public
health authorities of the public body controlling such
sewerage system. All chemical or industrial waste which
will place undue loads on a disposal system, as determined
by the Village Engineer or the Albany County Department
of Health or the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation, shall not be discharged into
any municipal system and must be treated by the user.
[5] Storage or stocking of any waste materials whatsoever
except in a completely enclosed building. Such materials
must be stored in a container system approved by the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation or
other state or federal agency exercising jurisdiction.

extend into the front yard setback.
[3] Landscaping. All areas of the plot not occupied by
building, parking, driveways or walkways or storage shall
be landscaped attractively with lawn, trees, shrubs or
other plant material. Such landscaping shall take into
consideration the natural growth presently on the
premises and the nature and condition of the terrain as
well as the situation of the lands and premises themselves
and with regard to adjoining lands and premises.
[4] Fences and walls. For property that is adjacent to a
residential district, there shall be provided along such
property lines a chain link fence, solid masonry wall or a
fence with slats six to eight feet high, depending on
topography as determined by the Planning Commission.
Except for landscaped areas and parking areas, a use
which is not conducted within a completely enclosed
building shall be screened by a six-foot solid masonry wall
or by a chain link fence covered with evergreen vine, a
fence with wood slats or a compact evergreen hedge.
Where a front yard adjoins a street separating an
industrial district from a residential district, the wall,
fence or hedge shall be located no closer to the street than
the the depth of the required buffer zone.

§ 242-11 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 242-12
237:506
safety, comfort, convenience, general welfare, environment, stability of
property values and aesthetics of the Village and its inhabitants that
their establishment, expansion or change requires a special procedure,
including detailed review and, where appropriate, imposition of special
requirements for the avoidance or mitigation of adverse effects or the
promotion of the purposes listed above, and that the interests of the

after the approval of a special permit by the Planning Commission
and in conformance with all conditions which may be part of such
special permit.
(2) The violation of any condition which is part of a special permit shall
be cause for revocation of any other permit or license which may
have been issued as a result of the approval of the special permit.
The Code Enforcement Officer or any other official of the Village
responsible for the issuance of permits is charged with the
enforcement of this provision. Further, such violation shall be

up to $250 per day for each day of violation.
C. Procedures.

requirements and objectives of this chapter. Application forms and
explanatory material are available from the Village Clerk.
Applications, in order to be considered complete, shall conform to
the requirements for preliminary plan submission in the
explanatory material, but incomplete applications may be
submitted to begin the special permit application process.
(2) Upon receipt of the application, the Village Clerk shall transmit all
copies of the application to the Planning Commission.
(3) The Planning Commission shall examine the application and
supporting material for completeness. If it finds the material
§ 242-12 WATERCOURSES § 242-12
237:507
§ 242-13. Regulation of nonconforming uses and buildings.
incomplete, the Commission shall notify the applicant promptly

furnish this required information within 60 days or within such
longer period as shall be mutually agreed upon.
(4) The Planning Commission shall study the application and schedule
a public hearing on it within 120 days, starting either at the
meeting when a complete application has been received or 60 days
after the original receipt of an incomplete application or after the
expiration of the mutually agreed extension period.
(5) The Planning Commission shall act on the application within 60
days of the public hearing or within such longer period as shall be
mutually agreed upon. The Planning Commission may approve or
disapprove the application. Where the Planning Commission
decides to approve, it shall add conditions or requirements as
appropriate in each case or as specified elsewhere in this chapter.
The Planning Commission shall notify the applicant promptly of its
decision, in writing. In reaching its decision, the Planning
Commission shall consider all aspects of the proposed use in detail,
with specific reference to the provisions in this chapter which are
applicable to the use and/or permit under consideration as well as
any material submitted to satisfy the provisions of Chapter 114,
Environmental Quality Review, of this Code. The record of the
decision shall show any reasons or findings used by the Planning
Commission in arriving at its decision and any conditions for
approvals.

applicant shall reimburse the Village for any additional costs
incurred for outside expert services which have not been paid.
A. Legislative intent. The purpose of this section is to promote and protect
the public health, welfare and safety by regulating existing
§ 242-12 VILLAGE OF COLONIE CODE § 242-13
237:508
nonconforming uses. It is intended to protect property values and
create a more attractive residential, economic and business climate in
the Village of Colonie.
B. Change in use.
(1) If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure on premises in combination may be changed
to a nonconforming use of the same nature or to a more restricted
use or to a conforming use, provided that a change to a more
restricted use or to another nonconforming use may be made only if
the relation of the structure to its surrounding property is such that
adverse effects upon occupants and neighboring property will not
be greater than if the original nonconforming use continued.
(2) No existing structure or premises devoted to a nonconforming use
shall be structurally altered, expanded or extended, except to have
such structure or premises conform to zoning requirements or to
comply with codes, rules or regulations relating to safety.
(3) The conforming use of a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming lot may be changed to another conforming use,
provided that:
(a) The change in use will not involve any change in structure or
lot resulting in an increase in the degree to which the structure
or lot is nonconforming.
(b) To the greatest extent possible, the structure or lot will be
wholly or partially brought into compliance with the Code as a
result of this change of use.

of Subsection B(3)(b) above have been met.
C. Extension of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use of a conforming
structure or premises may be expanded or extended into any other
portion of such structure or premises, but in no case shall the expansion
be greater than 25% of the gross floor area. Such shall require a finding
by the Zoning Board of Appeals that such enlargement or alteration is
installed or instituted in such a fashion as to minimize the detrimental
effects of the nonconforming use upon adjoining conforming uses. Such
expansion or extension shall be permissible only where the existing
nonconforming use consists of professional office space and the existing
use will be continued as professional office space. [Amended
8-10-1998 by L.L. No. 8-1998]
D. Repair or restoration of a nonconforming structure or a structure on a
nonconforming lot. Any nonconforming structure or structure on a
