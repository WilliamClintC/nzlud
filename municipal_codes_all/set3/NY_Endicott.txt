§ 1-3. Continuation of existing provisions.
The provisions of the Code, insofar as they are substantively the same as those of local laws,
ordinances and resolutions in force immediately prior to the enactment of the Code by this local law, as
distributed and renumbered in § 1-1 above, are intended as a continuation of such local laws,
ordinances and resolutions and not as new enactments, and the effectiveness of such provisions shall
date from the date of adoption of the prior local law, ordinance or resolution. All such provisions are
hereby continued in full force and effect and are hereby reaffirmed as to their adoption by the Board of
Trustees of the Village of Endicott, and it is the intention of said Board that each such provision
contained within the Code is hereby reaffirmed as it appears in said Code. Only such provisions of
former local laws and ordinances as are omitted from this Code shall be deemed repealed or
abrogated by the provisions of § 1-4 below.
§ 1-4. Repeal of enactments not included in Code.
All local laws and ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the Village of Endicott in force on

had shall not be counted.
Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department of the

the department to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the required act or
make the required inspection unless the terms of the provision or section designate otherwise.
Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females and
to firms, partnerships and corporations as well as to males.

be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions
upon the subject matter than the general restriction imposed by this Code, the provision imposing
the greater restriction shall be deemed to be controlling.
Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three or more persons or officers shall be
construed as giving such authority to a majority of such persons or officers.
Name of officer. Whenever the name of an officer is given, it shall be construed as though the
words "of the Village of Endicott" were added.

shall be equivalent to the words "affirm" and "affirmed."

sinking fund or capital budget fund requirements and the interest upon any of said bonds, said
Board shall report such fact and the amount of any such deficiency to the Board of Trustees.
It shall thereupon become the duty of the Board of Trustees to provide for such deficiency (only in
the case such deficiency exists in the payment of any such bond or interest) and pay the same in
the same manner as it may provide for the payment of the principal and interest upon any other
bonded indebtedness of said Village.
The Village, in addition to the power which it now possesses to raise money for all other purposes
by taxation, shall have the power to raise by a general tax annually, and it shall be the duty of the
Board of Trustees to levy and raise annually, upon the real property assessed for taxation in said
Village and as a part of the general tax levy, such sum as may be necessary to provide for the
payment of any such bonds and interest. The Village may, if necessary, make a temporary loan or
loans therefor in anticipation of the tax levy.
If the Board of Trustees shall have raised and paid any sum of such deficiency arising from the
insufficiency of the revenue of such system, the Board of Light Commissioners, as soon as
practicable by exercising the powers conferred upon it, shall increase the revenue of said system
sufficiently to prevent any further deficiency and shall also raise the amount of the deficiency that
shall have been paid by the Board of Trustees; and said Board of Light Commissioners shall pay
the amount of such deficiency when so raised into the general fund of said Village.
The sinking fund or capital budget fund provided for herein and the moneys belonging thereto
shall be kept by the Village Treasurer separate and apart from all other funds and accounts and
shall be deposited in such banks, trust companies or savings banks as shall be designated by the
Board of Light Commissioners and at such rate of interest thereon as may be agreed upon
between said banks or trust companies and the Village Treasurer, subject to the approval of the
Board of Light Commissioners. No such deposit in any such bank or trust company, however, shall
at any time be authorized in excess of 50% of the capital stock of such bank or trust company. The
Board of Light Commissioners or the Board of Trustees may require, by resolution, each such trust
company or bank wherein any such funds are deposited to execute and to deliver to the Village
Treasurer a bond with sufficient sureties conditioned to save the Village harmless in any event
from loss by reason of any deposits therein made, such bond to be approved by the Board
requiring such bond. Any such deposits shall be made in an account separate from other Village
funds and shall be properly distinguished and designated.
No money shall be withdrawn from any such fund except upon the warrant of the Village Treasurer
authorized by the resolution of the Board of Light Commissioners and concurring approval of the
Board of Trustees for the payment, redemption or purchase of the bonds, or some part thereof, for
the payment of which said sinking fund was created or for the transfer of such fund or some part
thereof to another depository designated or approved therefor by said Board of Light
Commissioners or for the payment of any capital expenditure upon the fulfillment or part fulfillment
of a predetermined purpose or plan.
Any bond paid, redeemed or purchased shall at once be canceled and returned to the Village
Treasurer with the report thereof to both the Board of Light Commissioners and the Board of
Trustees.
The funds remaining in any of said funds at any time, or any part thereof, may, however, be
invested by the Village Treasurer upon resolution of the Board of Light Commissioners and of the
Board of Trustees in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or State of New York or any

[Adopted 10-23-1989 by L.L. No. 5-1989 as Ch. 39, Art. I, of the 1989 Code]
§ 49-1. Compliance required; purpose.
Except as otherwise provided by law or labor agreements, sick leave with and without pay shall
hereafter be allowed in accordance with this article, but not otherwise.
It is hereby declared to be the purpose of this article in relating to sick leave to protect, as far as is
consistent with good employment policies, both the interests of the taxpayer and of the Village as
an employer and of the Village appointive officers, department heads and employees who, in the
course of their work, are absent from duty because of personal illness, physical disability,
exposure to contagion or death or illness in the immediate family. Absence from duty for such
reasons, if duly granted by the Mayor, department head or Board of Trustees, as hereinafter
provided, shall be considered and known as "sick leave."
§ 49-2. Granting sick leave.
An appointive officer, department head or employee of the Village of Endicott may be absent from duty
on account of sickness or disability, as aforesaid, if leave for such absence is granted by the Mayor or,
in the case of an employee, by the department head having supervision over such employee, and any
sick leave so granted shall be reported by every department head to the Board of Trustees as
hereinafter provided. No appointive officer, department head or employee shall receive any part of his
or her compensation while absent from duty because of illness or disability except as herein provided.
§ 49-3. Sick leave with pay.
7/14/2020 Village of Endicott, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/EN1075?guid=EN1075&children=true 58/501
Any appointive officer, department head or employee of the Village of Endicott may be granted sick
leave with pay up to one working day a month or 12 working days in any calendar year on account of
personal sickness or personal physical disability. Such sick leave with pay shall be granted by the
Mayor or, in the case of any employee under the supervision of a department head, by such head.
Such sick leave with pay shall be granted only when it appears to the satisfaction of the Mayor,
department head or Board of Trustees that the person is so sick or disabled as to render his or her
working detrimental to his or her health or recovery.
§ 49-4. Accumulation of sick leave.
If the 12 working days per calendar year hereby allowed and granted to each such appointive officer,
department head and employee for such sick leave with pay are not taken or used in any calendar
year, the amount or number of days not so taken or used may be accumulated from year to year and
used, if needed, up to a total of 150 working days.
§ 49-5. Limitation on accumulated sick leave with pay.
Any appointive officer, department head or employee who has accumulated sick leave time with pay,
as hereinbefore provided, by virtue of employment or service after the first day of July 1943, may,
during such sickness or disability, be granted sick leave with pay to the extent of the unused sick leave
time which he or she has accumulated, but no sick leave with pay shall be granted to any such person
in excess of 150 working days.
§ 49-6. Sick leave compensation.
Any appointive officer, department head or employee, upon being granted sick leave with pay as
aforesaid, shall receive full compensation at the regular rate for the time of such sick leave with pay not
exceeding, however, the accumulated and unused sick leave time with pay credited to any such
person.
§ 49-7. Computation of sick leave.
In computing the time for any sick leave with pay, every such appointive officer, department head and
employee shall be deemed to work or to have worked six days per calendar week, and absence from
duty under sick leave with pay shall use up accumulated sick leave with pay at the rate of six days per
calendar week. (As used in this section, a "calendar week" shall be deemed to be any period of seven
consecutive days.)
§ 49-8. Family illness or death.
Any appointive officer, department head or employee who is necessarily absent from duty because of
the serious illness or death of an immediate member of his family may be granted sick leave with pay
for not to exceed three working days in any calendar week (see § 49-7 for "calendar week"); provided,
further, that the Mayor or head of the department may allow further absence with pay not to exceed 15
additional working days. The term "immediate member of his family" shall be interpreted to mean any
person living as a member of the family in the same household or related by blood or marriage and
living under the same roof; except, however, in case of death, "immediate member of his family" shall
be interpreted to mean any member of the family closely related by blood or marriage.

Any appointive officer, department head or employee isolated or quarantined because of exposure to a
communicable disease, other than in the line of duty, shall, for the purpose of this article, be
considered absent because of sickness and may be granted sick leave with pay during such isolation
or quarantine to the extent of his or her accumulated and unused sick leave time.
§ 49-10. Disability and child-care policies.
Disability leave.
Any employee who anticipates undergoing a state of disability, such as but not limited to
hospitalization or medical treatment, may apply for a leave of absence based upon the
anticipated disability according to the provisions stated as follows. In all such instances an
approved leave of absence must be granted before the leave is begun.
Any employee who desires to continue working during the period of time when the disability
has been identified, up to the day the disability prevents the performance of required duties,
shall be allowed to work, provided that the member produces a physician's statement
asserting that said person is physically/medically capable of performing all duties required, up
to and including the date when work is to cease. In the event that situations develop which
contradict the original physician's statement, then a physician designated by the Trustees
shall be asked for an evaluation.
In no case shall the Village be obligated to permit an employee anticipating a state of
disability to continue in the performance of duties when the established performance has
declined substantially or is declining at a rapid rate. Said decision shall be at the discretion of
the employee's physician.
The employee requesting a disability leave shall indicate in writing the anticipated date when
the leave is to commence and the anticipated date when the leave is to end following
recovery from the disability.
The employee who has been on disability leave and who desires to return to duty following
recovery from the disability must produce a physician's statement stating that the employee is
capable of resuming duties expected in the Village and will be allowed to return to duty when
a position is available in the appropriate civil service title.
In ordinary circumstances, as determined by a physician, an employee who has undergone
hospitalization or home confinement shall be expected to resume duties on a full-time status
within five days of the date of release from hospitalization or home confinement. Extension of
leaves for disability reasons may be granted. The employee must make application, and the
disability must be verified by a physician. Said extension request will list the date the
employee is to return to work. Before returning to work, a physician's statement authorizing a
return to full-time duty will be required. These provisions shall not impose an obligation to
grant or extend a leave beyond the fiscal year (June 1 to May 31) in which the leave was
taken.
Child-care leave.
Any employee, regardless of sex, shall have the right to apply for a leave without pay for
child-care purposes.
In cases where both husband and wife are workers in this Village, only one of the pair shall be
entitled to leave.
The application for child-care leave must be made upon termination of the pregnancy or when
the child becomes a member of the family unit.

C.
Child-care leave may be granted for a period of time up to the end of the fiscal year in which
the leave began. Upon application, an extension of one year may be granted. An employee
who has been granted a child-care leave, upon returning to duty, may be assigned to any
position in the Village within the civil service title held.
Benefits and other economic factors.
Benefits will not accrue during the period of time the employee is on leave.
Wage increases given to other employees during the period of time the employee is on leave
will not be added to the employee's base rate. Wage changes will be based upon the increase
given to employees in the period of time which covers the last active work time of the
employee on leave.
Health insurance benefits will be maintained by direct payment of all premiums by the
employee during the time of the leave.
Any other benefits will neither be increased nor decreased during the time of the leave,
except sick time, which will be charged to the employee during the period of disability.
§ 49-11. Certification of illness.
The Mayor, department head or Board of Trustees may require a physician's certificate for any

aggregate amount to be spent in a year. The following items are not subject to competitive bidding
pursuant to § 103 of the General Municipal Law:
Purchase contracts under $10,000 and public works contracts under $20,000.
Emergency purchases.
Certain municipal hospital purchases.
Goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped.
Goods purchased from correctional institutions.
Purchases under state and county contracts.
Surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental entity.
The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will be documented in writing by
the individual making the purchase. This documentation may include written or verbal quotes from
vendors, a memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a copy of the
contract indicating the source which makes the item or service exempt, a memo from the
purchaser detailing the circumstances which led to an emergency purchase or any other written
documentation that is appropriate.
§ 52-2. Form of requests and proposals; exceptions.
All goods and services will be secured by use of written requests for proposals, written quotations,
verbal quotations or any other method that assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest price
and that favoritism will be avoided, except in the following circumstances:
Purchase contracts over $10,000 and public works contracts over $20,000.
Goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped pursuant to § 175-b of the
State Finance Law.

A good-faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of proposals or quotations. If the
purchaser is unable to obtain the required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event shall the failure to obtain the
proposals be a bar to the procurement.
§ 52-4. Documentation required.
Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each procurement.
§ 52-5. Award of contract to other than lowest responsible bidder.
Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is awarded to other than the lowest
responsible offerer. This documentation will include an explanation of how the award will achieve
savings or how the offerer was not responsible. A determination that the offerer is not responsible shall
be made by the purchaser and may not be challenged under any circumstances.
§ 52-6. Circumstances for not soliciting alternative proposals.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the procurement policy may contain
circumstances when or types of procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body,
the solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best interest of the municipality.
In the following circumstances, it may not be in the best interest of the Village of Endicott to solicit
quotations or document the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
Professional services or services requiring special or technical skill, training or expertise.
The individual or company must be chosen based on accountability, reliability, responsibility,
skill, education and training, judgment, integrity and moral worth. These qualifications are not
necessarily found in the individual or company that offers the lowest price, and the nature of
these services are such that they do not readily lend themselves to competitive procurement
procedures.
In determining whether a service fits into this category, the Village of Endicott Board of
Trustees shall take into consideration the following guidelines:
Whether the services are subject to state licensing or testing requirements.
Whether substantial formal education or training is a necessary prerequisite to the
performance of the services.
Whether the services require a personal relationship between the individual and
municipal officials.
Professional or technical services shall include but not be limited to the following:
Services of an attorney.

Services of a certified public accountant.
Investment management services.
Printing services involving extensive writing, editing or artwork.
Management of municipally owned property.
Computer software or programming services for customized programs or services
involved in substantial modification and customizing of prepackaged software.
Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General Municipal Law. Due to the
nature of this exception, these goods or services must be purchased immediately, and a delay in
order to seek alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of the residents.
This section does not preclude alternate proposals if time permits.
Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods from any source. If alternate proposals are required,
the Village of Endicott is precluded from purchasing surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or
through specific advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also difficult to
try to compare prices of used goods, and a lower price may indicate an older product.
Goods or services under $500. The time and documentation required to purchase through this
policy may be more costly than the item itself and would therefore not be in the best interest of the
taxpayer. In addition, it is not likely that such de minimis contracts would be awarded based on
favoritism.

§ 82-4. Application and approval required; fee; exceptions.
Application required. No emergency alarms as defined by § 82-2 of this chapter shall be installed
in the Village without prior submission of an application to and without prior approval of the Chief
of Police, Village of Endicott, to have said emergency alarm installed.
Exception. Any alarm installation which will terminate at either a central station or an answering
service will not need an application, but the installer must furnish the Police Department with
complete information as to type of alarm, maintenance service, emergency numbers and any
other information deemed pertinent by the Chief of Police.
§ 82-5. (Reserved).
§ 82-6. Maintenance; copy of regulations and instruction to be
provided.
Any and all emergency alarms in the Village must be adequately maintained. The owner of an
alarm system shall maintain the premises and the alarm system in a manner that will minimize or
eliminate false alarm dispatches, make every reasonable effort to respond or cause a
representative to respond to the alarm system's location within one hour when notified by the
Village to deactivate a malfunctioning alarm system, to provide access to the premises or to
provide security for the premises; and not manually activate an alarm for any reason other than an

caution possible is used in making these responses, but there is always the element of
danger. False alarms, when they are caused by human error or malfunctions of the equipment
at the subscriber's terminals, cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, an alarm user or
permit holder for a multiple dwelling, as defined in Chapter 160, Housing Standards, of the
Village Code, shall be subject to fines and warnings depending on the number of false alarm
dispatches emitted from an alarm system within a twelve-month calendar period based upon

Officer by filing a written request for hearing, setting forth the reasons for the appeal within 10

§ 138-39. Official records.
The Building Inspector shall keep official records of all permits, inspection reports, recommendations,
complaints and violation orders.
§ 138-40. Dangerous buildings.
A building or structure or part thereof which is an imminent danger to life and safety of the public
as a result of a fire or explosion is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
Whenever the Building Inspector finds a building or structure, or part thereof, to be an imminent
danger to life and safety of the public as a result of a fire or explosion, the Building Inspector may
cause it to be demolished and removed or may cause work to be done in and about the building or
structure as may be necessary to remove the danger.
The Building Inspector may require the occupants of any such building or structure, or part
thereof, to vacate the premises forthwith. No person shall use or occupy such building or structure,
or part thereof, until it is made safe. Except for the owner, no person shall enter premises which
have been ordered vacated unless authorized to perform inspections or repairs or to demolish and
remove such building or structure, or part thereof.
All costs and expenses incurred by the Village in connection with any work done to remove the
danger or in connection with the demolition and removal of any such building or structure shall be
assessed against the land on which such building or structure is located; and a bill for such
expenses shall be presented to the owner of the property, or, if the owner cannot be ascertained,
then such bill shall posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such assessment shall be and
constitute a lien upon such land. If the owner shall fail to pay for such expenses within 10 days
after the bill is presented or posted, a legal action may be brought to collect such assessment or to
foreclose such lien. As an alternative to the maintenance of any such action, the Building
Inspector may file a certificate of the actual expenses incurred as aforesaid, together with a
statement identifying the property in connection with which the expenses were incurred and the
owner thereof, with the Assessor, who shall, in the preparation of the next assessment roll, assess
such amount upon such property. Such amount shall be included in the levy against such property,
shall constitute a lien and shall be collected and enforced in the same manner, by the same
proceedings, at the same time and under the same penalties as are provided by law for the
collection and enforcement of real property taxes in the Village.
§ 138-41. Board of review.
Where practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships may result from enforcement of the strict
letter of any provision of the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code,
applications for variances consistent with the spirit of the code and not inconsistent with the
requirements of Article 18 of the Executive Law may be made to and acted upon by a Board of
Review.

§ 142-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Endicott finds that the potential and/or actual damages from
flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the Village of Endicott and that such
damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat
of such damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
§ 142-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards
or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damages.
Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
§ 142-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
Protect human life and health.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects.
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public.

§ 142-11. Floodplain development permit; fees and costs.
Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all construction and other
development to be undertaken in areas of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose
of protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new development is
constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake
any development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 142-6, without a valid floodplain development permit. Application for a permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may include but not be limited to
plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of
the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities
and the location of the foregoing.
Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be accompanied by an application
fee of $100. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village of Endicott
for any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this project. The local
administrator may require a deposit of not more than $500 to cover these additional costs.
§ 142-12. Permit application.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate; additional information may be
required on the permit application form:
The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement or
cellar) of any new or substantially improved structure to be located in Zone A1-A30, AE or AH or
Zone A if base flood elevation data is available. Upon completion of the lowest floor, the permittee
shall submit to the local administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed professional
engineer or surveyor.
The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new or substantially improved
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built floodproofed elevation,
certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any utility floodproofing will
meet the criteria in § 142-15C, Utilities.
A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any nonresidential floodproofed
structure will meet the floodproofing criteria in § 142-17, Nonresidential structures.
A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development. Computations by a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater conveyance than
the original stream segment. The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the documents
enumerated in § 142-6, when notified by the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other
costs assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be maintained.
A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by the local administrator,
which shows whether proposed development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.

In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other sources, base flood elevation
data shall be provided by the permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle parks and
subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five acres.
§ 142-13. Powers and duties of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include but not be limited to the following:
Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the following permit application
review before issuing a floodplain development permit. The local administrator shall:
Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the requirements of § 142-12,
Permit application, and for compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
Review subdivision and other proposed new development, including manufactured home
parks, to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall meet the applicable standards of §§ 142-14 through 142-18
and, in particular, § 142-14A, Subdivision proposals.
Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special flood hazard may result
in physical damage to any other property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant to submit additional technical
analyses and data necessary to complete the determination. If the proposed development
may result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§§ 142-14 through 142-18, no permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit
the application.
Determine that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies
from which approval is required by state or federal law.
Use of other flood data.
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated areas of special flood
hazard on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water
surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a
floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 142-12G, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements or other proposed development meet the requirements of this chapter.
When base flood elevation data is not available, the local administrator may use flood
information from any other authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard for the purposes of this chapter.
Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
Construction stage.

The local administrator shall, in Zones A1-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A, if base flood
elevation data is available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion of floodproofing
of a new or substantially improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of
the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation in relation to mean sea
level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the
site. A certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on
a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway
use).
Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of the certification shall be at
the permit holder's risk. The local administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless immediately
corrected.
Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or architect shall make
periodic inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor
compliance with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested, that the
development is in compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development permit and/or
any variance provisions.

§ 142-19. Appeals Board.
The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Village of Endicott shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the local administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the
Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management
program of that area.
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with conducting search-andrescue
operations during periods of flooding.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
search-and-rescue operations and maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities,
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of this chapter, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary
to further the purpose of this chapter.
The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical
information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.

Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in § 142-19D(1) through
(12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination
that:
The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
an historic structure.
The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
Variances shall not[1] be issued by a community for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent
use, provided that:
The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety.
Editor's Note: So in original. "Shall not" should probably be "may."
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause
fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the base
flood elevation shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from lowest floor
elevation.
§ 142-21. Severability.

§ 157-2. Historic Review Committee.
There is hereby created a Historic Review Committee.
The Committee shall consist of each of the members of the Planning Board of the Village of
Endicott, New York.
§ 157-3. Designation of landmarks and historic districts.
The Planning Board acting as an Historic Review Committee may recommend to the Board of
Trustees for approval an individual property as a landmark if it:
Possesses special character or historic or aesthetic interest or value as part of the cultural,
political, economic or social history of the locality, region, state or nation;
Is identified with historic personages;
Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style;
Is the work of a designer whose work has significantly influenced an age; or
Because of a unique location or singular physical characteristic, represents an established
and familiar visual feature of the neighborhood:
Historic districts.
The Planning Board acting as an Historic Review Committee may recommend to the Board of
Trustees for approval a group of properties as an historic district if it:
Contains properties which meet one or more of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior
Historical National Register Standards for designation of an historical district; and
By reason of possessing such qualities, constitutes a distinct section of the Village.
Such recommendation will first be sent to the Village Planning Board for approval.
The filing of historic preservation districts with the Village Clerk will be deemed amendments
to the 1999 Zoning Map, Village of Endicott, Broome County, New York, and shall be deemed
to comply with the requirements of § 250-27 of this Code.
Notice of a proposed designation shall be sent by certified mall, return receipt requested, to the
owner of the property proposed for designation, describing the property proposed and announcing

Veterans Memorial Park.
[Added 12-17-2001 by L.L. No. 8-2001]
The following triangular parcel of land, which was transferred by the Endicott Johnson
Corporation to the Village of Endicott, is designated as the "Veterans Memorial Park" and is
permanently set aside to commemorate the memory of veterans and the principles of a free
nation under law for which they sacrificed their lives. The said parcel of land in the Village of
Endicott is bounded on the west by Jefferson Avenue and on the north by Park Avenue and
on the south by Main Street. It is recognized that the said parcel was developed to
memorialize veterans by George F. Johnson in 1920 who erected a monument in honor of the
World War I veterans, and was further developed during the 1993-1999 period by private
funds raised by a private Veterans Memorial Park Monument Committee whose Chairman,
Martin F. Dardis, had been authorized by the Village Board of Trustees to erect monuments
thereon to memorialize the efforts of the World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War
veterans.
Administration and care.
The care and administration of the Veterans Memorial Park is hereby entrusted to a
committee consisting of:
The members from time-to-time of the Veterans Memorial Park Monument
Committee whose current Chairman is Martin F. Dardis, created only by, and
perpetuated by and representing the various posts of the American Legion, the
chapters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the chapters of the Korean War Veterans
and the chapters of the Vietnam War Veterans and such chapters as may be created
to represent other war veterans, and which consists of 12 members. It is recognized
that the rules of said Committee provide that all vacancies (including the
Chairmanship) are to be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members.
One elected member of the governing body of the Village of Endicott or the
successor municipality as elected by the Village Board of Trustees.
Each member shall have one vote on issues which come before it.
Powers and duties. The Committee as described in Subsection G(2) herein:
Shall maintain and increase the public's awareness of the principles of freedom and
democracy for which the veterans gave their lives and which are memorialized by this
Veterans Memorial Park;

concerning the care, maintenance, improvements, insurance coverage, landscaping and
other matters pertaining to the administration and preservation and perpetuation of the

petition requesting such a hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor at
any time prior to the date set forth in the notice that the violation must be corrected. Upon receipt
of such petition, the enforcement officer shall set a time and place for such hearing and shall give
the petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing, the enforcement officer shall have the burden
of proving any violation alleged by him in the notice, and the petitioner shall be given an
opportunity to be heard and show why such notice should be modified or withdrawn. The hearing
shall be commenced not later than 20 days after the date on which the petition was filed, provided

order. After a hearing in the case of any notice suspending any permit required by this chapter or
by any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, when such notice has been sustained by the
hearing officer, the permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such permit which has
been suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be automatically revoked if a petition for hearing
is not filed in the office of the enforcement officer within 20 days after such notice is served. Any
notice served pursuant to Subsection A shall automatically become a final order if a written
petition is not filed in the office of the enforcement officer as provided in Subsection B.

of the enforcement officer, shall be summarized, reduced to writing and entered as a matter of
public record in the office of the enforcement officer. Such record shall also include a copy of

after a hearing before the hearing officer where an order is made may seek relief therefrom by
appealing to the Board of Trustees.
Existence of emergency; hearing without notice; issuance of order. Whenever the enforcement
officer finds that an emergency exists which requires immediate action to protect the public health,
he may, without notice, request an immediate hearing before the hearing officer, and the hearing
officer may issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and requiring that such
action be taken as he deems necessary to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this chapter, such order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such
order is directed shall comply therewith immediately but, upon petition to the enforcement officer,
shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible. After such hearing, depending upon his finding as
to whether the provisions of this chapter and of the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto
have been complied with, the hearing officer shall continue such order in effect or modify it or
revoke it.

agreements between owners and operators or occupants as to which party shall assume such
responsibility.

Every occupant of a dwelling containing a single dwelling unit shall be responsible for the
extermination of any insects, rodents or other pests therein or on the premises; and every occupant of
a dwelling unit in a dwelling containing more than one dwelling unit shall be responsible for such
extermination whenever his dwelling unit is the only one infested. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provision of this section, whenever infestation is caused by failure of the owner to maintain a dwelling
in a ratproof or reasonably insectproof condition, extermination shall be the responsibility of the owner.
Whenever infestation exists in two or more of the dwelling units in any dwelling or in the shared or
public parts of any dwelling containing two or more dwelling units, extermination thereof shall be the
responsibility of the owner.
§ 160-36. Maintenance of plumbing fixtures.
Every occupant of a dwelling unit shall keep all plumbing fixtures therein in a clean and sanitary
condition and shall be responsible for the exercise of reasonable care in the proper use and operation
thereof. This liability on the part of the occupant shall not relieve the owner of the responsibility of
remedying any defect nor of any other liability imposed upon the owner by law, but it shall subject the
occupant to the penalties of this chapter, upon proper proof of any willful or malicious act he has
performed.
§ 160-37. Maintenance of yards, lawns and courts.
Yards, lawns and courts shall be maintained in a clean, sanitary and safe condition and free from

set forth in this chapter within seven days from the time such person has been served with a notice to
maintain properly a yard, open porch, court, lawn or vacant lot and within 30 days from the time such
person has been served with a notice to maintain properly any dwelling or part thereof, the Village may
cause said maintenance to be completed, and the total cost thereof shall be assessed upon the real

property on which said maintenance is completed and shall constitute a lien and charge on the real
property on which it is levied until paid or otherwise satisfied or discharged and shall be collected by
the Village Treasurer in the manner provided by law for the collection of delinquent taxes. A notice
issued herein shall be served either personally upon the owner, the manager designated by § 160-31

Article I. General Provisions
§ 190-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees in the Village of Endicott finds that public nuisances exist in the Village of
Endicott in the operation of certain establishments and the use of property in flagrant violation of
certain Penal Law and municipal Code provisions, which nuisances substantially and seriously
interfere with the interest of the public in the quality of life and total community environment, commerce
in the Village, property values and the public health, safety and welfare. The Board further finds that
the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is detrimental to the health, safety and
welfare of the people of the Village of Endicott and of the businesses thereof and the visitors thereto. It
is the purpose of the Board to authorize and empower the Board of Trustees to impose sanctions and
penalties for such public nuisances, and such power of the Board of Trustees may be exercised either
in conjunction with, or apart from, the powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of
procedures and remedies available under such other laws. The Board of Trustees further finds that the
sanctions and penalties imposed by the Board of Trustees pursuant to this chapter constitute an
additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response to the proliferation of the abovedescribed
public nuisances. The sanctions and penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to
protect the health and safety of the people of the Village of Endicott and to promote the general
welfare.

§ 193-30. Obtaining Village sponsorship for an event.
An event permit applicant may request Village sponsorship of an event. Such requests must be
made on an annual basis for each event. Eligibility for Village sponsorship of an event shall be
determined by the nature of the proposed event, and shall be limited to events which celebrate a
national holiday, public service, or events which provide a public service. Events for which income
is intended to be generated (including through the rental of space or booths, or through
fundraising activities) shall not be eligible for Village sponsorship unless the Village of Endicott
directly receives all such income. Events which allow the sale of alcohol and/or other risky
behavior shall not be eligible for Village sponsorship. The Village may refuse a request for
sponsorship as a result of complaints received due to noise which is considered unreasonable
given the nature of the event, the accumulation of garbage or other debris, and other issues which
may diminish the value of the event to the Village of Endicott and its residents.
The applicant will describe any proposed donation of time, materials, gifts or services to be
contributed to the event. If the Village approves the request for sponsorship, then such donations
will be deemed accepted by the Village.
The initial responsibility for determination of eligibility shall be made by the Village Clerk upon
consultation with the Village Board. The Village Clerk and the Village Board may request input
from a designated representative from the Office of the Mayor and from a designated
representative from the Village Board prior to making a final determination.
If the request for sponsorship is approved, the Village shall assume responsibility for the event,
and shall be considered the organizer and sponsor of the event. Under such circumstance, the
event permit applicant shall be considered a co-sponsor and co-organizer. The Village of Endicott
may either purchase the necessary insurance coverage or allow the Village of Endicott's generally
self-insured status to cover any liabilities which may be incurred during the course of the event.
The Village of Endicott may include in the annual budget an amount which shall be dedicated to
the purchase of insurance policies for Village-sponsored events.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village may agree to be a participating sponsor of an event
without accepting responsibility for planning or organization of the event. In such case the
organizers of the event will be required to provide insurance.
§ 193-31. Event permit fees.
The fee for an event permit shall be set from time to time by the Board of the Village of Endicott
and shall apply to each date of the proposed event. Additional fees for access to Village electricity,
water service, and/or for the closure of any Village street may apply.
All fees for event permits wherein the applicant does not claim eligibility for Village sponsorship
shall be paid upon event permit application. Event permits wherein the applicant claims eligibility
for Village sponsorship may be submitted without the appropriate fee; however, should the Village
determine that the event is ineligible for Village sponsorship, all fees must be paid prior to the
issuance of such permit.
Event permit applicants shall not be charged additional fees for rain dates, if requested.
Event permit applicants requesting a refund of event permit fees due to cancellation of an event or
withdrawal or denial of the permit application must submit such request, in writing, at least 10
business days prior to the event. Fees may be nonrefundable if the Village incurred any expenses
due to preparation for the event.

All event permits issued pursuant to this article shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
The event permit applicant is responsible for inspecting the public property which he or she
intends to reserve for the exclusive and reserved use of the event in order to determine whether or
not the public property is suitable for the proposed event, and to ensure that there are no defects
or dangerous conditions. If, subsequent to submitting the event permit application, a new defect or
dangerous condition appears, the event permit applicant must advise the Village of Endicott in
writing at least five business days prior to the event. The Village may, in its discretion, correct the
defect or dangerous condition or may advise the applicant to cancel or adjourn the proposed
event. If the event permit applicant provides less than five business days' prior notice or elects to
proceed with the proposed event before the defect or dangerous condition is remedied, the event
permit applicant and event participants waive any right of action against the Village of Endicott.
The event permit applicant shall maintain responsibility for the Village property which is reserved
for the exclusive and reserved use of the event, and shall be responsible for the cleaning,
maintenance and/or repair of said event area:
Maintenance shall include cleaning the Village property which is reserved for the exclusive
and reserved use of the event of all rubbish and debris, leaving the site in a clean condition.
Such maintenance shall be subject to the satisfaction of the Village of Endicott. Maintenance
shall also include the repair of any Village property which may have been damaged during the
course of the event.
Failure to clean, maintain, and/or repair the event area to the satisfaction of the Village may
result in the denial of future event permit applications. If such failure should occur, the Village
shall provide services for the cleaning, maintenance and/or repair of the area in which the
event was held, and the cost of such services shall be billed to the event permit applicant.
The Chief of Police may at his/her discretion and in the interest of public safety require the event
permit applicant to provide adequate security for the duration of the event (e.g., events which
include the service of alcohol, and based upon the number of anticipated event participants or due
to the time of the event). In addition, the Chief of Police may determine the number of volunteers
and/or event marshals necessary to ensure the safety of event participants and other Village
residents.
Applicants who request closure of any Village street must place a legal notice in the Press & Sun-
Bulletin at least two days and not more than five days prior to the first day of the event. The legal
notice must state the name of the event, the street(s) to be closed, and the time(s) and date(s) of
closure. Recurring events may place one legal notice with all approved dates and times. This
section shall not apply to an event on a Saturday, Sunday, or a national holiday.

area or times, e.g., an event permit does not supersede an existing outdoor cafe permit.
Any notice can be e-mailed to the event permit applicant or the sponsoring organization.
§ 193-34. Permit rejections, modifications, denials and
revocations.
The Village of Endicott reserves the right to reject event permit applications which are incomplete
and/or unaccompanied by the required documentation. The rejection of a permit application does
not preclude the event permit applicant from resubmitting the event permit application in the
future, when such application is complete. The resubmission of an event permit application shall
not exempt the event permit applicant from the submission deadlines.
Modifications. The Village of Endicott reserves the right to modify an event permit and/or its

discharge of waters and waste into the public sewer systems of the Village of Endicott, hereinafter
referred to as the "Village," and provide penalties for the violation thereof.
This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributions into the
wastewater collection and treatment system for the Village and enables the Village to comply with
all applicable State and Federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). The objectives of this chapter are to:
Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater collection system which will interfere
with the operation of the POTW or contaminate the resulting sludge;
Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater collection system which will pass
through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludge from the POTW; and
Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal wastewater POTW.
This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the Village's
wastewater collection system through the issuance of discharge permits to certain nondomestic
users and through enforcement of general requirements for all users, authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customer's capacity will not
be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting
from the program established herein

§ 200-43. Suspension of permit; severance of connection;
restoration of services.
The Superintendent of Public Works may cease wastewater treatment services by suspension of
the discharge or special permit held by the user when, in his opinion, suspension is necessary to
avert an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment or would cause
interference with the POTW operation or cause a violation of the treatment plant SPDES permit.
Should a user fail to comply with the suspension notice, the Superintendent of Public Works may
take such steps as he deems necessary, including the immediate physical severance of the sewer
connection to the public sewer system.
Services shall be restored upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. Such
proof shall be in the form of a written report by the user describing the causes of the condition and
the measures taken to prevent future occurrences followed by an inspection of the facility by the
Superintendent of Public Works to verify such measures.
§ 200-44. Power of Superintendent to refuse discharge.
Nothing under this chapter shall be construed to reduce, in any manner, the power of the
Superintendent of Public Works to refuse the acceptance of a discharge if, in his opinion, there is

the responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. No user
who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until accidental or slug discharge prevention procedures have
been developed. The POTW will evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each significant
industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is
needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum the following elements:
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that
would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written
notification within five days; and
If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and or measures
and equipment for emergency response.
§ 200-47. Report of accidental discharge.
If, at any time, a facility has not compiled with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition or
limitation in this chapter, the facility responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the
Superintendent of Public Works so that corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment works.
The notification of an accidental or slug discharge shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration of pollutants, volume of flow, and corrective actions taken or planned. In addition, a
written report addressed to the Superintendent of Public Works detailing the date, time and cause of
such discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent
future discharges shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of
the noncomplying discharge. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the treatment plant, fish kills or any
other damage to person or property, resulting from the accidental or slug discharge, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
chapter or other applicable pretreatment standards, regulations or laws.
Article IV. Enforcement
§ 200-48. Notice of violation.
Whenever the Superintendent of Public Works determines that there are reasonable grounds to

Applicants for an industrial/commercial wastewater discharge permit shall complete a prescribed
form available at the Village of Endicott Department of Public Works office. The application will be
approved if the applicant has complied with all applicable requirements of this chapter.
§ 200-63. Application fees.
Users required to file for a waste discharge permit shall complete and file an application with the
Village of Endicott Superintendent of Public Works for each connection to the public sewer system
from the user's facilities, in the ease of significant industrial users. For the purposes of this section,
a significant industrial user includes:
All industries subject to promulgated categorical pretreatment standards.
Industries having substantial impact, either singly or in combination with other contributing
industries, on the operation of the treatment works.
Manufacturing industries using, on an annual basis, more than 10,000 pounds or 1,000
gallons of raw material containing priority pollutants/substances of concern and discharging
immeasurable amounts of these pollutants to the sewer system from the process using these
pollutants.
Those industries discharging more than 5% of the flow or load carried by the treatment plant
receiving the waste.
No fee shall be charged to any nonresidential commercial business user who does not qualify as a
significant industrial user as herein defined.
§ 200-64. Conditional waste discharge permit.
Should pretreatment or other operational controls be determined as necessary by the monitoring and
enforcement group in order to comply with the provisions of this chapter or USEPA National
Categorical Standards as they are promulgated, a waste discharge permit may be issued conditionally
providing sufficient time for the user to commence proceedings for the design, construction and
approval of suitable pretreatment facilities or other operational controls meeting the prescribed
standards. Such conditional permit shall require renewal every six months wherein satisfactory
progress on the implementation of the facility's construction shall be demonstrated. Where progress is
unsatisfactory to the Village of Endicott Superintendent of Public Works, he may delay issuance of a
renewal permit until satisfactory progress is demonstrated. Each day the user discharges wastes
without a valid permit constitutes a violation of this chapter.
§ 200-65. Procedure upon revision of discharge limits.
Within six months of the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the discharge
permits of users subject to such standard shall be revised to comply with the limits specified therein
within the time frame set forth by such standard. Users shall have 90 days thereafter to submit new
permit applications to the Village of Endicott Superintendent of Public Works, which shall include a
report on the disposition of pollutants in their waste streams so affected and, if necessary, a schedule
for the construction of pretreatment facilities or other operational controls for meeting the prescribed
standards. Conditional permits may be issued as in § 200-64 above.

§ 212-1. Purpose; objectives.
The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
Village of Endicott through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This
article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the MS4 in order to comply
with requirements of the SPDES general permit for municipal separate storm sewer systems. The
objectives of this article are:
To meet the requirements of the SPDES general permit for stormwater discharges from MS4s,

To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 since such systems are not designed to
accept, process or discharge nonstormwater wastes;
To prohibit illicit connections, activities and discharges to the MS4;
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures
necessary to ensure compliance with this article; and
To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of trash, yard
waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, grease, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products,
paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other pollutants into the MS4.

SPECIAL CONDITIONS
DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE WITH WATER QUALITY STANDARDS
The condition that applies where a municipality has been notified that the discharge of
stormwater authorized under its MS4 permit may have caused or has the reasonable potential
to cause or contribute to the violation of an applicable water quality standard. Under this
condition the municipality must take all necessary actions to ensure future discharges do not
cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards.
LISTED WATERS
TERS  The condition in the municipality's MS4 permit that applies where the MS4
discharges to a 303(d) listed water. Under this condition the stormwater management
program must ensure no increase of the listed pollutant of concern to the 303(d) listed water.
TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD (TMDL) STRATEGY
The condition in the municipality's MS4 permit where a TMDL including requirements for
control of stormwater discharges has been approved by the EPA for a water body or
watershed into which the MS4 discharges. If the discharge from the MS4 did not meet
the TMDL stormwater allocations prior to September 10, 2003, the municipality was
required to modify its stormwater management program to ensure that reduction of the
pollutant of concern specified in the TMDL is achieved.
The condition in the municipality's MS4 permit that applies if a TMDL is approved in the
future by the EPA for any water body or watershed into which a MS4 discharges. Under
this condition the municipality must review the applicable TMDL to see if it includes
requirements for control of stormwater discharges. If a MS4 is not meeting the TMDL
stormwater allocations, the municipality must, within six months of the TMDL's approval,
modify its stormwater management program to ensure that reduction of the pollutant of
concern specified in the TMDL is achieved.

violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit authorization.
§ 212-9. Best management practices; individual sewage
treatment systems.
Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit discharges as defined in § 212-2
or activities contaminating stormwater as defined in § 212-8 the municipality may require
implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and
activities.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his or her
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or may be, the source of an illicit
discharge as defined in § 212-2 or an activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 212-8,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit authorizing the discharge
of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section.
Individual sewage treatment systems; response to special conditions requiring no increase of
pollutants or requiring a reduction of pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the municipality's being subject to the special conditions as defined in § 212-2 of
this article, the owner or operator of such individual sewage treatment systems shall be required
to:
Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as follows:
Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge accumulation. Septic
tanks must be pumped out whenever the bottom of the scum layer is within three inches
of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is within 10
inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary tee.
Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents, kitchen wastes, laundry wastes
and household chemicals; and
Avoid the disposal of cigarette butts, disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, trash and
other such items.

A written certificate of compliance shall be submitted by the design professional to the
municipality at the completion of construction of the repair or replacement system.
§ 212-10. Suspension of access to MS4; illicit discharges in
emergency situations.
The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter, in
writing, of the reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the municipality's
MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator, in writing, of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor. The violator may petition the SMO for a
reconsideration and hearing. Access may be granted by the SMO if he or she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its recurrence. Access may
be denied if the SMO determines, in writing, that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to
recur. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the SMO.
§ 212-11. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES stormwater discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a
form acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 212-12. Access to and inspection of facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must inspect to enforce any
provision of this article or whenever the authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that
there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a
violation of this article.
Access to facilities.
The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger
has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry

into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
the SMO.
Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records as may be required to
implement this article.
The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this article such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility's stormwater discharge.
The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to this article to install monitoring
equipment as is reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this article. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a facility subject to this article is a
violation of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility subject to this article commits
an offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to the facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is
discharged and he or she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be
a violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order
issued hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
§ 212-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or
operation or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any
known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said
person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the
municipality, in person or by telephone or facsimile, no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the municipality
within three business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also
retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such
records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 212-14. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
Notice of violation.
When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a
requirement of this article, he or she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and desist;

The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the
restoration of any affected property;
The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
Payment of a fine; and
The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall
set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a
contractor, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by law, any person
who violates the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not
exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for conviction of a
first offense; conviction of a second offense, both of which were committed within a period of five
years, is punishable by a fine of not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and conviction of a third or subsequent offense all of
which were committed within a period of five years, is punishable by a fine of not less than $700
nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both. However, for
the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this
article shall be deemed misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating to
misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a
separate additional violation.

Article I. General Provisions
§ 213-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the
hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition.
This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, including
siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species.
Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of
native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity
of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater
recharge and stream baseflow.
Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the
municipality.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized
through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities.
The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities is in the public
interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing
stormwater management and site design will mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and
sedimentation from development.
§ 213-2. Purpose; objectives.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and
controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of the public residing within
this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 213-1 hereof. This chapter seeks to meet those
purposes by achieving the following objectives:
Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES general permit for stormwater
discharges from municipal separate stormwater sewer systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or
as amended or revised;
Require land development activities to conform to the substantive requirements of the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) general permit for construction activities, GP-02-01, or as amended or revised;
Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce
flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels;

Installation of sediment and erosion control measures.
Completion of site clearing.
Completion of rough grading.

completed has received approval by the Stormwater Management Officer.
Stormwater management practice inspections. The Village of Endicott Stormwater Management
Officer is responsible for conducting inspections of stormwater management practices (SMPs). All
applicants are required to submit as-built plans for any stormwater management practices located

all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer.
Inspection of stormwater facilities after project completion. Inspection programs shall be
established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random
inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of
drainage basins or areas identified as higher-than-typical sources of sediment or other
contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
higher-than-usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are
more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment
quality standards or the SPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and

Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and faithful completion of all land
development activities related to compliance with all conditions set forth by the Village of Endicott
in its approval of the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Village of Endicott may require the
applicant or developer to provide, prior to construction, a performance bond, cash escrow or
irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate financial or surety institution which guarantees
satisfactory completion of the project and names the Village of Endicott as the beneficiary. The
security shall be in an amount to be determined by the Village of Endicott based on submission of
final design plans, with reference to actual construction and landscaping costs. The performance
guarantee shall remain in force until the surety is released from liability by the Village of Endicott,
provided that such period shall not be less than one year from the date of final acceptance or such
other certification that the facilities have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans
and specifications and that a one-year inspection has been conducted, and the facilities have
been found to be acceptable to the Village of Endicott. Per annum interest on cash escrow
deposits shall be reinvested in the account until the surety is released from liability.
Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion and sediment control
facilities are to be operated and maintained by the developer or by a corporation that owns or
manages a commercial or industrial facility, the developer, prior to construction, may be required
to provide the Village of Endicott with an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved financial
institution or surety to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater management
and erosion control facilities both during and after construction and until the facilities are removed
from operation. If the developer or landowner fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater
management and erosion and sediment control facilities, the Village of Endicott may draw upon
the account to cover the costs of proper operation and maintenance, including engineering and
inspection costs.
Recordkeeping. The Village of Endicott may require entities subject to this chapter to maintain
records demonstrating compliance with this chapter.

The name and address of the landowner, developer or applicant;
The address, when available, or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the
violation is occurring;
A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the land development activity into
compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action;
A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be assessed against the person to
whom the notice of violation is directed;
A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the municipality by filing a
written notice of appeal within 15 calendar days of service of notice of violation.

work order shall be in effect until the Village of Endicott confirms that the land development
activity is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to
address a stop-work order in a timely manner may result in civil, criminal or monetary
penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this chapter.
Violations. Any land development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to this
chapter may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by law, any person
who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not
exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for conviction of a
first offense; conviction of a second offense, both of which were committed within a period of five
years, is punishable by a fine of not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and conviction for a third or subsequent offense all of
which were committed within a period of five years, is punishable by a fine of not less than $700
nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both. However, for
the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this
chapter shall be deemed misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating to
misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a
separate additional violation.
Withholding of certificate of occupancy. If any building or land development activity is installed or
conducted in violation of this chapter, the Stormwater Management Officer may prevent the
occupancy of said building or land.
Restoration of lands. Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In
the event that restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the Village of
Endicott may take necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the
property until paid.

filed a federal personal income tax return or, if no such return is filed, the calendar year. Where
title is vested in either the husband or wife, their combined income may not exceed such sum.
Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain
from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or
exchange of a capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings and

provided, however, that in the event of the death of either a husband or wife in whose name title of
the property shall have been vested at the time of death and then becomes vested solely in the
survivor by virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased husband or wife, the time of
ownership of the property by the deceased husband or wife shall be deemed also a time of
ownership by the survivor, and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of
computing such period of 24 consecutive months. In the event of a transfer by either a husband or
wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the property, the time of ownership of the
property by the transferor spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee
spouse, and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing such
period of 24 consecutive months. Where property of the owner or owners has been acquired to
replace property formerly owned by such owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or other
involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership of the former property shall be
combined with the period of ownership of the property for which application is made for exemption,
and such periods of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for purposes of this section.
Where a residence is sold and replaced with another within one year and both residences are

within the state, the period of ownership of both properties shall be deemed consecutive for
purposes of the exemption from taxation.
Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes; provided, however, that in the
event that any portion of such property is not so used exclusively for residential purposes but is
used for other purposes, such portion shall be subject to taxation, and the remaining portion only
shall be entitled to the exemption provided by this section.
Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in whole or in part by the owner
or by all of the owners of the property, provided that an owner who is absent while receiving
health-related care as an inpatient of a residential health-care facility, as defined in § 2801 of the
Public Health Law, shall be deemed to remain a legal resident and an occupant of the property
while so confined, and income accruing to that person shall be income only to the extent that it
exceeds the amount paid by such owner, spouse or co-owner for care in the facility; and provided,
further, that during such confinement such property is not occupied by other than the spouse or
co-owner of such owner.
§ 222-4. Application; filing.
Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the owners of the property, on
forms prescribed by the State Board, to be furnished by the appropriate assessing authority, and shall
furnish the information and be executed in the manner required or prescribed in such forms and shall
be filed in such Assessor's office on or before the appropriate taxable status date.

and notice or the failure of such person to receive the same shall not prevent levy, collection and
enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property owned by such person.
§ 222-6. Penalties for offenses.
Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the application for exemption shall be
punishable by a fine of not more than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants from further

thereof or of the principal officer of the corporation to the effect that the statements contained
therein are true.
§ 222-32. Payment.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay to the Village Treasurer the
tax imposed by this article for the period covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at
the time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the return is
required to be filed.
§ 222-33. Insufficient returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory to the Village
Treasurer and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by
notice from the Village Treasurer or if no return is made for any period, from such information as he or
she is able to obtain, and if necessary, the Village Treasurer may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. The Village Treasurer shall give notice of such determination to the
person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the
person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing or unless the Village Treasurer, of his or her
own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his or
her decision to the person liable for the tax. The decision of the Village Treasurer may be reviewed by
a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if
application therefor is made within 30 days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to
review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an
undertaking filed with him or her, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme

the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest,
penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
§ 222-34. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given by mailing the same
to the person for whom it is intended, in a postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address
given by him or her in the last return filed by him or her under this article or, if no return has been filed,
then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence
of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined
according to the provisions of this article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from the date
of mailing of such notice.
§ 222-35. Penalty for failure to file or pay; exceptions.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay a tax or any portion thereof within the
time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of

was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this
section.
§ 222-36. Refunds.
If within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty the payer thereof shall make application for a
refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any
portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of
the Village Treasurer. However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a
determination of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or
it shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out
of moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided,
shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village
Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his or her determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he or she shall be entitled
to an order to review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore
contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 222-37. Tax to be part of operating cost.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and shall not be
added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others but shall constitute a
part of the operating cost of such utility.
§ 222-38. Action to enforce payment; lien.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the Village Attorney
shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The
proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer. Each
such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same
manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a
lien.
§ 222-39. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have power to make such reasonable
rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the exercise of his or her
powers and the performance of his or her duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other
records relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony and proofs, under

Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of
New York or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this article
when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in
either of which events the court may require the production of and may omit in evidence so much
of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no
more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his or her duly
authorized representative of a copy of any return filed by him or her, nor to prohibit the publication
of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof
or the publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their

§ 230-2. Tobacco retail license required.
Starting May 1, 2020, no person shall sell, offer for sale, or permit the sale of tobacco products or
tobacco-related products to consumers in the Village of Endicott without a valid tobacco retail
license issued by the Village Clerk. A tobacco retail license is not required for a wholesale dealer
who sells tobacco products or tobacco-related products to retail dealers for the purpose of resale
only and does not sell tobacco products or tobacco-related products directly to consumers.
All tobacco retail licenses issued pursuant to this section are nontransferable and nonassignable
and are valid only for the applicant and the specific address indicated on the tobacco retail license.
A separate tobacco retail license is required for each address at which tobacco products or
tobacco-related products are sold or offered for sale. Any change in business ownership or
business address of a person holding a tobacco retail license shall immediately terminate such
person's tobacco retail license, provided such person may apply for a new tobacco retail license.
All tobacco retail licenses issued pursuant to this section are valid for no more than one year and
expire on April 30 following the effective date of the tobacco retail license. As set forth in § 230-8,
a tobacco retail license may be revoked by the Police Chief or designee prior to its expiration date
for cause.
Applications for a new tobacco retail license shall be made on a form specified by the Village
Clerk, at least 30 days prior to May 1. The Village Clerk may require such forms to be signed and
verified by the applicant or an authorized agent thereof.
Applications for a renewed tobacco retail license shall be made on a form specified by the Village
Clerk at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the current license. The Village Clerk may require
such forms to be signed and verified by the applicant or an authorized agent thereof.
Applications for a new or renewed tobacco retail license shall be accompanied by the fee required
by § 230-7.
The issuance of any tobacco retail license pursuant to this chapter is done in the discretion of the
Village of Endicott and shall not confer upon licensee any property rights in the continued
possession of such a license.
§ 230-3. Issuance of licenses.
Upon the receipt of a completed application for a new or renewed tobacco retail license and the
fee required by § 230-7, the Police Department and the Fire Department, upon the showing of
proper credentials and in the discharge of their duties, may enter to inspect the location at which
tobacco sales are to be permitted. The Police Department also may ask the applicant to provide
additional information that is reasonably related to the determination of whether a license may
issue.
At the request of the Police Department or Fire Department, the Village Attorney is authorized to
make application to the Village Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction for the issuance
of a search warrant to be executed by a police officer in order to conduct an inspection of any
premises believed to be subject to this chapter. The Police Chief or Fire Chief or their designee
may seek a search warrant whenever the owner, managing agent, or occupant fails to allow
inspections of any dwelling unit contained in the rental property where there is a reasonable cause
to believe that there is a violation of this chapter, the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and
Building Code, or the Code of the Village of Endicott.
No tobacco retail license shall be issued by the Village Clerk to an applicant if one or more of the
following bases for denial exists:

Article IVA. Snow Emergencies
§ 235-52.1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Endicott finds the following:
That a three-inch accumulation of snow requires the Village of Endicott to institute operations for
the purpose of plowing and removal of said snowfall.
That all plowing of snow on the streets and highways of the Village cannot be safely and
completely carried out unless the streets and highways of the Village are unobstructed by parked
motor vehicles.
That parking must be prohibited on all streets and highways where all-night parking is allowed to
permit orderly plowing in a snow emergency; that snow removal can be completed if parking is
prohibited on those streets where all-night parking is otherwise permitted between the hours of
9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. following any three-inch accumulation of snow.
That the removal of snow accumulations of three inches or more is required for the purpose of
safety insofar as it is required to permit the safe passage of ambulances, fire apparatus, police
vehicles and other emergency equipment.
That the prohibition of parking on all streets and highways, except as hereafter noted, after a
three-inch snowfall and accumulation will promote and ensure the public safety of the residents of
the Village and the public at large.
§ 235-52.2. Parking restrictions.
[Amended 10-24-1994 by L.L. No. 24-1994]
Any three-inch snowfall shall, for the purposes of this chapter, constitute a snow emergency. No owner
or operator of a motor vehicle shall park the same unattended on any Village street or highway within
the Village of Endicott following any snowfall of three inches or more between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
until said street or highway shall have been plowed by or at the direction of the Street Department of
the Village of Endicott, except in the following locations where parking will be prohibited during a snow
emergency from the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. until such streets are plowed:

§ 238-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Junk Vehicles Law of the Village of Endicott."
§ 238-2. Legislative intent.
This chapter is enacted in recognition of the fact that a clean, wholesome, attractive environment is
declared to be of importance to the health and safety of the inhabitants and the safeguarding of their
material rights against unwarranted invasion, and, in addition, such an environment is deemed
essential to the maintenance and continued development of the economy of the Village and the
general welfare of its citizens. The unrestrained accumulation of motor vehicles not in operating
condition is a hazard to such health, safety and welfare of citizens of the Village, necessitating the
regulation, restraining and elimination thereof. This chapter is enacted in recognition of the fact that

There is hereby established a new comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for the Town of Union and the
Villages of Johnson City and Endicott, which is set forth in the text, tables, illustrations and map that
constitute this chapter. The Zoning Ordinance is adopted to promote and protect the public health,
safety and general welfare and provide for solar access. The Zoning Ordinance implements the goals
and objectives of the 2008 Unified Comprehensive Plan, which include:
Providing a wide variety of living environments for all socioeconomic groups in the population and
a diversity of housing densities and types, ranging from rural low density to urban high density.
Providing a sound commercial base, offering convenience, choice and a wide variety of goods and
services.
Improving the economy by promoting new and expanded industrial enterprises, retaining existing
enterprises and redeveloping existing industrial facilities in order to further diversify the economic
base and to provide for increased employment on a permanent basis.
Providing a transportation network which is capable of moving people and goods efficiently and
safely.
Maintaining the infrastructure at a level needed to continue adequate services to Town and Village
residents.
Enriching the lives of all citizens by striving to improve the quality of the environment.
Accommodating solar energy systems, equipment and access to sunlight.
§ 300-10.6. Provisions deemed to be minimum requirements;
compliance with other applicable regulations.
The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are the minimum requirements deemed necessary to
carry out the Zoning Ordinance's stated purpose and intent.
In addition to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, all uses and development must comply
with all other applicable Village, Town, state, and federal regulations.
All references in the Zoning Ordinance to other Village, Town, state, or federal regulations are for
informational purposes only and do not constitute a complete list of such regulations. These
references do not imply any responsibility for the Town or Villages to enforce state or federal
regulations.
§ 300-10.7. Conflicting provisions.
Conflict with state or federal regulations. If the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are inconsistent
with those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision will control, to the
extent permitted by law. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions
or more stringent controls.
Conflict with other Town or Village regulations. If the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are
inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with provisions found in other adopted ordinances
or regulations of the Town or Villages, the more restrictive provision will control. The more
restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions or more stringent controls.
Conflict with private agreements and covenants. This Zoning Ordinance is not intended to interfere
with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between
private parties. If the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance impose a greater restriction than

imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance will control. If the
provisions of a valid, enforceable private agreement impose a greater restriction than this Zoning
Ordinance, the provisions of the private agreement will control. The Town and Villages do not
enforce or maintain a record of private agreements.
§ 300-10.8. Severability.
If any portion of this Zoning Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that portion is to be deemed severed from the Zoning Ordinance, and in no way affects the
validity of the remainder of the Zoning Ordinance.
Article 11. General Rules of Language and Interpretation
§ 300-11.1. Meaning and intent.
The language of the Zoning Ordinance must be read literally. Regulations are no more or less strict
than stated. Words defined in Article 71 (General Terms) have the specific meaning assigned, unless
the context expressly indicates another meaning. Words that are not defined in Article 71 have the
meaning given in the latest edition of Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.
§ 300-11.2. Tenses and word usage.
Words used in the singular include the plural. The reverse is also true.
Words used in the present tense include the future tense. The reverse is also true.
The words "must," "will," "shall" and "may not" are mandatory.
The word "may" is permissive, and "should" is advisory, not mandatory or required.
When used with numbers, "up to X," "not more than X" and "a maximum of X" all include X.
§ 300-11.3. Conjunctions.
Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, conjunctions have the following meanings:
"And" indicates that all connected items or provisions apply; and
"Or" indicates that the connected items or provisions may apply singularly or in combination.
§ 300-11.4. Fractions.
The following rules apply to fractional number unless otherwise expressly stated.
Minimum requirements. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any
fractional result of 0.5 or more must be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number. For
example, if a minimum requirement calling for one tree to be provided for every 30 linear feet of
frontage is applied to a fifty-foot dimension, the resulting fraction of 1.67 is rounded up to two
required trees.
7/14/2020 Village of Endicott, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/EN1075?guid=EN1075&children=true 370/501
B. Maximum limits. When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits, any fractional result
will be rounded down to the next lower whole number. For example, if a maximum limit of one
dwelling unit for every 5,000 square feet is applied to a lot of 12,500 square feet, the resulting
fraction of 2.5 is rounded down to two (allowed dwelling units).
§ 300-11.5. Headings and illustrations.
Headings and illustrations are provided for convenience and reference only and do not define or limit
the scope of any provision of this Zoning Ordinance. In case of any difference of meaning or
implication between the text of this Zoning Ordinance and any heading, drawing, table, figure, or
illustration, the text controls.
§ 300-11.6. Current versions and citations.
All references to other Village, Town, county, state, or federal regulations in the Zoning Ordinance refer
to the most current version and citation for those regulations, unless expressly indicated otherwise.
When the referenced regulations have been repealed and not replaced by other regulations, Zoning
Ordinance requirements for compliance are no longer in effect.
§ 300-11.7. Lists and examples.
Unless otherwise expressly indicated, lists of items or examples that use "including," "such as," or
similar terms are intended to provide examples only. They are not to be construed as exhaustive lists
of all possibilities.
§ 300-11.8. Delegation of authority.
Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or another officer or employee of
the Town or Villages to perform an act or duty, that provision will be construed as authorizing the
department head or officer to delegate that responsibility to others over whom they have authority.
Delegation of authority is not allowed when the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance expressly prohibit
such a delegation.
§ 300-11.9. Public officials and agencies.
All employees, public officials, bodies, and agencies to which references are made are those of the
Town of Union or the Villages of Johnson City or Endicott unless otherwise expressly stated.
§ 300-11.10. Commentaries.
Commentaries are sometimes included in the Zoning Ordinance as a means of clarifying certain
provisions or providing supplemental information. Text marked as "Commentary" has no regulatory
effect. It is intended solely as a guide for administrative officials and the public. Commentaries may be
added to the Zoning Ordinance by the Planning Director without the need for a formal ordinance
amendment.
Commentary: When commentaries appear they will appear in this manner.

§ 300-12.1. Establishment.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Zoning Ordinance are shown on
a zoning map maintained by the Planning Director and the Town and Village Boards. The Planning
Director will be responsible for keeping the Zoning Map up-to-date. The Official Zoning Map, together
with all notations, references, data and other information shown on the Map, is adopted and
incorporated into this Zoning Ordinance.[1] It is as much a part of this Zoning Ordinance as if actually
depicted within its pages.
Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Village offices.
§ 300-12.2. Maintenance and updates.
The Planning Director is responsible for directing revisions to the Official Zoning Map to reflect its
amendment as soon as possible after the effective date of Zoning Map amendments (rezonings). No
unauthorized person may alter or modify the Official Zoning Map. The Planning Director may authorize
printed copies of the Official Zoning Map to be produced, and must maintain digital or printed copies of
superseded versions of the Official Zoning Map for historical reference.
§ 300-12.3. District boundaries.
When the ordinance establishing a zoning boundary identifies the boundary as following a particular
feature, or reflects a clear intent that the boundary follows the feature, the boundary will be construed
as following that feature as it actually exists. The Official Zoning Map must note any such relationship
between a zoning boundary and other mapped feature on the Zoning Map when entering the zoning
boundary.
§ 300-12.4. Interpretations of district boundaries.
Where any uncertainty exists about a zoning boundary, the actual location of the boundary will be
determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals using the following rules of interpretation:
A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a river, stream, lake or other
watercourse will be construed as following the actual center line of the watercourse. If, subsequent
to the establishment of the boundary, the center line of the watercourse should move as a result of
natural processes (flooding, erosion, sedimentation, etc.), the boundary will be construed as
moving with the center line of the watercourse.
A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a ridgeline or topographic
contour line will be construed as following the actual ridgeline or contour line. If, subsequent to the
establishment of the boundary, the ridgeline or contour line should move as a result of natural
processes (erosion, slippage, subsidence, etc.), the boundary will be construed as moving with the
ridgeline or contour line.
A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a lot line or parcel boundary will
be construed as following the lot line or parcel boundary as it actually existed at the time the
zoning boundary was established.
A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a street or railroad line will be
construed as following the center line of the street or railroad right-of-way.
A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following the boundary of an adjacent
municipality will be construed as following that boundary.
7/14/2020 Village of Endicott, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/EN1075?guid=EN1075&children=true 372/501
F. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately parallel to, or as an apparent extension
of, a feature described above will be construed as being actually parallel to, or an extension of, the
feature.
Article 13. Transitional Provisions
§ 300-13.1. Applications submitted before effective date.
Development applications that were submitted in complete form and are pending approval before
January 1, 2012, may be reviewed wholly under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance in effect
immediately before January 1, 2012, or they may be reviewed wholly under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance. Whether such review takes place under the provisions of the previous Zoning Ordinance or
under this Zoning Ordinance is the applicant's option. The applicant's decision about which ordinance
applies, once submitted, may not be changed. All development applications submitted on or after
January 1, 2012, will be reviewed wholly under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
§ 300-13.2. Permits issued before effective date.
Any building, development or structure for which a building permit was issued before January 1, 2012,
may be completed in conformance with the issued building permit and other applicable permits and
conditions, even if such building, development or structure does not fully comply with provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance. If building is not commenced and diligently pursued within the time allowed under
the original permit or any extension granted, then the building, development or structure must be
constructed, completed and occupied only in strict compliance with the standards of this Zoning
Ordinance.
§ 300-13.3. Continuation of violations.
Any violation of the previous Zoning Ordinance will continue to be a violation under this Zoning
Ordinance and be subject to penalties and enforcement under Town and Village Law. If the use,
development, construction or other activity that was a violation under the previous ordinance complies
with the express terms of this Zoning Ordinance, enforcement action will cease, except to the extent of
collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the effective date specified in § 300-13.1. The
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance does not affect nor prevent any pending or future prosecution of, or
action to abate, violations of the previous ordinance that occurred before the effective date specified in
§ 300-13.1.
§ 300-13.4. Nonconformities.
Any nonconformity under the previous Zoning Ordinance will also be nonconformity under this Zoning
Ordinance, as long as the situation that resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous
regulation continues to exist. If, however, a nonconforming situation under previous zoning regulations
becomes conforming because of the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, or any subsequent
amendment to it, then the situation will no longer be considered a nonconformity. A situation that did
not constitute a nonconforming situation under the previously adopted Zoning Ordinance does not
achieve nonconforming status under this Zoning Ordinance merely by repeal of the previous Zoning
Ordinance.

Rural Residential. The purpose of the Rural Residential District is to balance residential
development with the preservation of rural character and farming activities within the Town and to
support the goals and objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. This district will
promote suitable placement of buildings and accessory structures in relation to the site and
surrounding areas in order to minimize the potential for loss of productive agricultural resources
and the disruption of environmentally sensitive areas.

village neighborhoods within Endicott, Johnson City, and Endwell and to support the goals and
objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. These neighborhoods are generally
characterized by owner-occupied, single-family, detached homes placed on lots approximately
4,000 square feet in size. The USF District is established to maintain the character and lifestyle
offered by these single-family neighborhoods. The USF District is intended for areas with access
to public water and sanitary sewer service.

traditional village neighborhoods within the Villages and the Town and to support the goals and
objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. These neighborhoods are generally
characterized by owner-occupied, single-family, detached homes placed on lots 9,000 square feet
in size or larger. The SSF District is established to maintain the character and lifestyle offered by
these single-family neighborhoods. The SSF District is intended for areas with access to public
water and sanitary sewer service.
Urban Two-Family. The purpose of the Urban Two-Family District is to provide neighborhoods that
offer one- and two-family living opportunities and to support the goals and objectives contained in
the Unified Comprehensive Plan. These neighborhoods are generally characterized by single- and
two-family homes that provide an environment that has traditional design elements, such as
unobstructed front yards, front porches, and pedestrian friendly streetscapes. The UTF District is
established to maintain the character and lifestyle offered by these single- and two-family

sewer service.
Urban Multifamily. The purpose of the Urban Multifamily District is to provide the broadest range of
residential living opportunities within Endicott, Johnson City, and Endwell and to support the goals
and objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. These neighborhoods may contain a
mix of single- or two-family homes as well as higher-density developments, such as apartments or
townhouses, on lots that may be as small as 4,000 square feet in size. Developments in this
district shall employ techniques to minimize negative impacts (including circulation, parking, glare,
noise, etc.) on existing residential areas.
Suburban Multifamily. The purpose of the Suburban Multifamily District is to provide the broadest
range of residential living opportunities within the Town and to support the goals and objectives
contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. These neighborhoods may contain a mix of singleor
two-family homes as well as higher-density developments, such as apartments or townhouses,
on lots that may be as small as 7,000 square feet in size. Developments in this district shall
employ techniques to minimize negative impacts (including circulation, parking, glare, noise, etc.)
on existing residential areas.

The commercial districts are listed below. When this Zoning Ordinance refers to commercial,
central business, office, or C zoning districts, it is referring to one of the following:
Table 21-1
Commercial Districts
District Name Map Symbol
Neighborhood Commercial NC
Central Business CB
General Commercial GC
Commercial Office CO
The district names and map symbols are intended to provide a general indication of what is
allowed in the district by denoting the commercial or office orientation of the district.
§ 300-21.2. District purposes.
Neighborhood Commercial. The purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial District is to encourage
smaller-scaled commercial development, compatible with the scale and intensity of adjacent
residential and noncommercial sites, and to support the goals and objectives contained in the
Unified Comprehensive Plan. This district allows for commercial operations along collector and
arterial type streets offering convenience shopping and services for adjacent residential areas.
Central Business. The purpose of the Central Business District is to foster a concentration of
small-scale, mixed use activity and to support the goals and objectives contained in the Unified
Comprehensive Plan. The CB District is established to maintain and enhance the traditional mix of
retail, office, civic and residential uses within the core of the Villages. Development in this district
should reinforce compact, pedestrian-oriented development and preservation of traditional historic
character.
General Commercial. The purpose of the General Commercial District is to encourage commercial
development and to support the goals and objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive
Plan. The GC District is established to provide areas for intensive commercial activities that
primarily depend upon a large volume of vehicular traffic and serve the daily shopping needs of
the community-at-large and surrounding areas. This district encourages the application of site
design and buffering techniques to mitigate the impacts of commercial operations and traffic on
adjacent uses and the traveling public.
Commercial Office. The purpose of the Commercial Office District is to accommodate office and
nonretail activity in a manner that protects and enhances existing residential neighborhoods. The
CO District permits a mix of residential and office type uses along primary and secondary
thoroughfares that may not be suitable for single-family living due to increasing traffic volumes.
These volumes create an environment suitable for certain multifamily and office uses that can
exist in close proximity to neighborhoods without adversely affecting the residential environment.
§ 300-21.3. Uses.
Uses are allowed in commercial and office zoning districts in accordance with Table 21-2.
Uses identified with a "P" in Table 21-2 are permitted as-of-right in the subject zoning district,
subject to compliance with all other applicable standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
Uses identified with a "SP" in Table 21-2 may be allowed if reviewed and approved in accordance
with the special permit procedures contained in Article 66.

Article 51. Off-Street Parking, Loading and Stacking
Regulations
§ 300-51.1. Intent.
The intent of the following standards is to:
Ensure that any parking area or facility is designed to provide proper circulation, reduce hazards
to pedestrians, and protect the users of adjacent properties from nuisances caused by the noise,
fumes, and glare of headlights which may result from the operation of vehicles;
Reduce congestion on the streets;
Ensure there are adequate amounts of parking and loading facilities to serve the use(s) and users
of the property; and
Encourage alternative parking designs and modes of transportation to reduce dependence on
single-occupancy vehicular trips and improve efficiency during travel.
§ 300-51.2. Applicability.
For every building hereafter erected, altered, extended or changed in use, there shall be provided offstreet
parking spaces at least as set forth below as a condition precedent to occupancy of all buildings
or land. Off-street parking, loading and stacking facilities conforming to the requirements of this article
shall be provided as follows:
New or moved buildings and uses. Parking, loading and stacking facilities, as required, shall be
provided for all buildings and uses constructed, established or moved to new sites.
Increase in intensity of use. An increase in the intensity of use of a building or premises shall
mean the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or any other unit of
measurement used as a basis for determining required parking, loading and stacking facilities.
Additional parking, loading and stacking facilities, as required, shall be provided for any such
increases in an existing use.
Change in use. When the use of any building or premises is changed to a different use, parking,
loading and stacking facilities, as required, shall be provided for the different use.
Nonconformity parking, loading and stacking facilities. A building, use or occupancy lawfully
existing at the time this article or any amendment thereto becomes effective, but which does not
conform to the off-street parking, loading and stacking requirements, may be occupied or
continued without such facilities being provided. Any such spaces that may be provided thereafter
shall comply with the requirements of this article. If an existing building, use or occupancy is
altered so that there is an increase in the number of dwelling units, seating capacity, employees or
floor area, or if the use is changed to one requiring more off-street parking, loading and stacking
spaces, the number of such spaces shall be provided at least equal to the number required for the
increased area of the building or use in accordance with all provisions of this article.
Existing facilities. Off-street parking, loading and stacking facilities in existence on the effective
date of this article shall not be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced
below the requirements for an equivalent new building or use. In no case shall it be necessary to
continue parking, loading and stacking facilities in excess of those required by this article for
equivalent new buildings or uses.

Article 54. Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering
Regulations
§ 300-54.1. Intent.
The following standards are intended to implement the Town and Villages long-term planning goals by
assuring an acceptable degree of buffering between land uses, particularly between residential and
nonresidential uses, including agricultural operations, providing a balance between developed uses
and open space, enhancing the visual and aesthetic appearance of the community and encouraging
preservation of existing natural features. Specifically, these regulations are intended to:
Provide natural visual screening of parking areas and along property boundaries to protect the
existing visual quality of adjacent lands.
Reduce surface runoff and minimize soil erosion through the natural filtering capability of
landscaped areas.
Provide natural buffers that reduce glare and noise, provide wildlife corridors and protect wildlife
habitats, wetlands, stream corridors and other significant environmental features.

Moderate the microclimate of parking areas by providing shade, absorbing reflected heat from
paved surfaces and creating natural wind breaks.
Enhance the overall visual quality of the community by surrounding developed areas with a variety
of plant materials that are consistent and compatible with the existing natural vegetation of the
area.
§ 300-54.2. General requirements.
Development activities requiring site plan approval shall submit, as part of such approval, a
landscaping plan in accordance with Article 54 of this chapter. This shall include, but not be limited
to, commercial, retail, industrial, multifamily residential, and institutional uses.
Existing site vegetation and unique site features, such as stone walls, shall be incorporated into
landscaping plans to the maximum extent feasible. Existing healthy trees which are retained shall
be credited against the requirements of these regulations in accordance with their size and
location.
The issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall require completion of lot grading, seeding and
required landscaping, or posting of a performance guaranty acceptable to the Code Enforcement
Officer if the applicant cannot perform the work due to seasonable impracticalities. In this case, all
landscaping work shall be completed by June 30th of the year following the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.
All required landscaping shall be of healthy stock and planted according to accepted horticultural
practices. Landscaping plans may also include a landscape maintenance plan as required in
Article 54 to clearly indicate who is responsible for plant maintenance during the first 24 months
after planting, and a performance guaranty may be posted for assuring replacement in kinds of
plants which die or become diseased within that time at the Planning Board discretion.
All required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition by the property owner. Failure to
maintain such landscaping or to replace dead or diseased landscaping required by this chapter
shall constitute a violation of these regulations.
Where existing conditions make compliance with these regulations not feasible, the Planning
Board, at its discretion, may approve planters, plant boxes or pots containing trees, shrubs and/or
flowers to comply with the intent of these regulations.
Trees for screening shall be of species and stock that will provide a visual screen from the ground
up, at least five feet in height. Species adequate for the Town and Village can be determined by a
registered landscape architect, landscape consultant, or other professionals or using resources
such as the National Arbor Day Foundation or the local Cornell Cooperative Extension.
Trees shall have minimum caliper of two inches at the time of planting. Shrubs shall have a
minimum height of two feet at the time of planting.
Pedestrian access to sidewalks or buildings should be considered in the design of all landscaped
areas.
§ 300-54.3. Landscaping standards.
All plant materials must conform to the most current edition of the American Nursery and Landscape
Association's American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1  2004). Applicants are required to

(USDA Hardiness Zone 5). Proper trees shall be chosen where any height restrictions (i.e. power lines)
exist to minimize conflicts and improper pruning techniques.
Perimeter landscaping. Landscaping shall be required along the perimeter of projects, or within
the required setbacks, and shall be provided except where driveways or other openings may be
required. The Planning Board may consider alternatives to the location of landscaping materials,
based on the existing character of the neighborhood. For large development projects such as
shopping centers, perimeter landscaping shall apply to the full perimeter of the project, and not to
internal property lines. The linear feet guidelines below are to be used to calculate the number of
required plantings; they do not require that plantings be uniformly spaced. Rather, grouping of
plants consistent with accepted landscape practice is encouraged. Specific requirements are as
follows:
At least one tree for each 40 linear feet of the perimeter of the lot; and
At least one shrub for each 10 linear feet of the perimeter of the lot.
Parking areas. Parking lots containing 20 or more spaces shall be internally landscaped so as to
provide shade and screening and in order to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of traffic.
The area designated as required setbacks shall not be included as part of the required
landscaping. Plantings shall be spaced and grouped consistent with accepted nursery standards,
and shall not be located in a manner that impedes driver visibility. Specific requirements are as
follows:
A landscaped buffer at least 10 feet in width must be provided between a parking lot and the
public rights-of-way. In traditional village settings, this distance may be reduced to be
consistent with existing setbacks;
Shade trees shall be planted along the frontage, parallel to the frontage road with a spacing
not to exceed 40 feet or consistent with existing tree spacing on neighboring lots when
present;
A minimum of one landscaped island, at least 200 square feet in size, shall be provided for
every 20 parking spaces contained within each single row of parking. Islands shall be planted
with trees and shrubs with a minimum of one tree per 20 parking spaces;
End islands shall be required for all parking configurations entirely surrounded by drive aisles,
provided that such configurations contain more than five spaces in a single row and 10
spaces in a double row. End islands shall completely separate the parking spaces from the
drive aisle;
Landscaped parking lot medians, a minimum of 10 feet in width, shall be used to completely
separate driveway entrance aisles from parking areas;
Landscaped areas shall contain no less than eight feet in average width;
Trees and shrubs located within or adjacent to paved areas shall be salt tolerant;
All plant material adjacent to parking areas, loading areas, and driveways shall be protected
by barriers, curbs, or other means to prevent damage from vehicles.
All landscaped areas shall be planted with vegetative ground cover or shall be mulched, so
that no bare ground exists; and
Plantings shall present a clear view of any driving lane within 15 feet.
Screening. To reduce headlight glare from parked vehicles, lighting from a parking or loading area,
as well as reduce noise and airborne particles, the following standards are provided for parking
areas, loading areas, drive-through lanes, and maneuvering areas.

If there is insufficient space to accommodate a ten-foot landscaped area, the Planning Board
may allow screening to consist of a wall, fence, berm, hedge, or other plant materials or
combinations thereof no less than five feet high.
Minimum screening requirements shall also be provided, but not limited to, the following
situations:
Multifamily dwellings abutting single-family or two-family dwellings.
Commercial, industrial, and institutional uses abutting single-family and two-family
residential uses.
Manufactured home communities abutting a public right-of-way, single-family or twofamily
use.
Outdoor storage areas specified in Article 40 of this chapter.
New residential development adjacent to active farm operations or vacant, open fields
that contain prime agricultural soils.
§ 300-54.4. Landscaping plan.
The Planning Board may determine that the landscaping plan must be prepared by a licensed
landscape architect, landscape designer or other professional. All landscaping plans shall contain
the following information:
A title block with the name of the project, the name of the person preparing the plan, a scale,
North arrow and date.
All existing, significant plant materials on the site.
Existing and proposed structures.
Topographical contours at two-foot intervals.
Drainage patterns.
Location, size and description of all landscape materials existing and proposed, including all
trees and shrubs, and shall identify those existing plant materials that are to be protected or
removed.
Landscaping of parking areas, access aisles, entrances, common open areas, recreation
areas, and perimeter buffer areas.
Other information as may be required by the Code Enforcement Officer and/or the Planning
Board.
Alternative landscaping plans may be submitted, provided that they meet the purpose and intent of
these regulations.
§ 300-54.5. Landscaping maintenance.
A landscape maintenance agreement shall be required and executed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for commercial, industrial, multifamily residential and institutional uses. The

agreement shall ensure the long-term care of the landscape, making the property owner and/or lessee
responsible for maintaining the quality of all plant material, non-plant landscaping, and irrigation
systems used in conjunction with the landscaping. Improper maintenance shall be determined through
periodic inspection by the Code Enforcement Officer.
Maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, watering, weeding, mowing (including trimming at
the base of fencing), fertilizing, mulching, proper pruning, and removal and replacement of dead or
diseased trees and shrubs on a regular basis.
All landscaping and plant material that is missing, dead, decaying, or injured as of September 30
shall be replaced by June 30 of the following year at the owner's expense. The replacement shall
be of the same species and size unless otherwise approved.
Irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize spray on buildings, neighboring properties, roads
or sidewalks; maintained in proper operating condition and conserve water to the greatest extent
feasible through proper watering techniques.
§ 300-54.6. Screened dumpster or service area requirements.
In any district, all areas designated, used or intended to be used as dumpster or service areas for any
building or land use, other than one-family and two-family dwelling units, shall be screened from view
with either a wall, a solid fence or a combination of fencing and evergreens creating a solid visual
barrier to a height of at least five feet above grade level on all sides where the adjacent land is in a
residential district or a residential use.
Article 55. Outdoor Lighting Regulations
§ 300-55.1. Intent.
The purpose of this section is to establish regulations to allow for outdoor illumination levels which are
appropriate for the use, while promoting safety and security, and minimizing the undesirable side
effects of excessive illumination such as glare, light trespass, and light pollution. Over time, it is the
intent that this section will allow for reasonably uniform illumination levels in the community.
§ 300-55.2. Applicability.
This regulation shall apply to all new outdoor lighting fixtures, the expansion and alteration of existing
fixtures, as well as the replacement of lighting fixtures, except any repair or maintenance.
§ 300-55.3. Approvals required.
For uses which require a site plan review, the Planning Board may require a lighting site plan to be
submitted showing the location, number, type/style, mounting height, and lighting levels produced on
the ground (i.e., photometric report). All other uses shall conform to the general requirements
contained herein.
§ 300-55.4. General requirements/standards.
All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be shielded or otherwise contained on the property from which it
originates (known as "light trespass limitations").

Exterior lighting fixtures on commercial, industrial, institutional, and multifamily properties shall
conform to the Illuminating Engineer Society of North America (IESNA) criteria for full cutoff
fixtures. In addition, the lighting levels shall be designed to meet the minimum requirements of the
latest recommended levels set forth by IESNA. Where no standard from IESNA exists, the
Planning Board shall determine the appropriate level, taking into account levels for the closest
IESNA activity.
To minimize the indiscriminate use of illumination, lighting, except as required for security, shall be
extinguished during nonoperating hours. Where practicable, lighting installations are encouraged
to include timers, sensors, and dimmers to reduce energy consumption and unnecessary lighting.
§ 300-55.5. Specific requirements/standards.
Parking lots. Parking lots shall not exceed light levels necessary for safety and for locating
vehicles at night. The lighting plan shall be designed so that the parking lot is lit from the outside
perimeter inward and/or incorporate design features with the intent of eliminating off-site light
spillage.
Canopy and roof overhang. Lights installed on canopies or roof overhangs shall be recessed so
that the lens cover is flush with the bottom surface of the canopy or overhang. Lights shall not be
mounted on the sides or top of the canopy or overhang.
Outdoor signs. Lighting fixtures used to illuminate an outdoor sign shall be mounted on the top of
the sign and shall be shielded or directed in such a way that the light illuminates the sign only.
Internal illumination of a sign shall be concealed behind opaque, translucent, or other similar types
of glass or plastic.
Bottom-mounted or up-lighting. To comply with "dark skies" and minimize unnecessary lighting,
up-lighting shall be only allowed for flagpoles that display federal, state, and/or local government
flags only, provided that the illumination is directed onto the flagpole only.
Security cameras. Facilities which employ security cameras may employ appropriate lighting to
ensure proper function during all times when such cameras are in use.
§ 300-55.6. Exemptions.
The following types of outdoor lighting are exempt from this regulation unless otherwise specified:
Street lighting installed by the Town or Villages, Broome County Highway Department, or the New
York State Department of Transportation.
Low-voltage lighting as defined by the National Electric Code (NEC).
Holiday lighting.
Temporary construction and emergency lighting needed by police, emergency or highway crews,
provided the light is extinguished upon completion of the work.
Hazard warning lights required by a federal or state regulatory agency, except that all fixtures used
must be as close as possible to the federally required minimum output.
Lighting associated with farm or agricultural operations. However, farm or agricultural operations
within 100 feet of an adjacent residential dwelling shall be shielded to prevent light trespass onto
the adjoining property.

§ 300-55.7. Prohibited lighting.
The following lighting is prohibited:
Blinking, flashing, strobe or search lights.
Exposed strip lighting used to illuminate building facades or signs.
Any light that may be confused with or construed as a traffic control device.
Article 56. Nonresidential Design Standards
§ 300-56.1. Purpose.
The nonresidential design guidelines and standards are established for commercial and industrial
areas outside of the Central Business Districts. The guidelines and standards, through the review and
regulation of design characteristics, preserve and promote the unique character of the Town and
Villages. The guidelines and standards are intended to encourage lively, pedestrian-friendly and
attractive streetscapes where local residents and visitors enjoy walking, biking, driving and shopping.
§ 300-56.2. General building design.
The massing and proportion of new front facades shall relate to the proportion of surrounding
buildings.
New construction shall respect existing building widths by providing a horizontal division of the
facade into visible building increments no larger than the average width of existing buildings in the
corridor. Facades may be subdivided through the use of window patterns, slightly projecting bays,
pilasters, or other elements.
To the maximum extent practical, all roof-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened from
view or isolated so as not to be visible from any public right-of-way or residential district within 150
feet of the subject lot, measured from a point five feet above grade.
Alternative energy sources, such as solar panels or shingles, are encouraged and should be
incorporated into the design of the building so as not to detract from the overall design.
Developers and builders are encouraged to utilize roofing materials that reflect sunlight (i.e.,
lighter colors) or incorporate vegetated roofing on at least 50% of the roof area. Methods such as
these decrease heating and cooling needs on a building by reflecting sunlight rather than
absorbing it.
§ 300-56.3. Facades.
Exterior building walls facing streets or pedestrian walkways shall include windows, building
entrances and other architectural features to create an interesting streetscape and comfortable
pedestrian realm. Appropriate facade articulation includes the use of bays, insets, balconies,
porches, or stoops related to entrances and windows.
Along street facades, all new industrial construction shall provide areas of transparency equal to
20% of the wall area and all new commercial construction shall provide areas of transparency

equal to 40% of the wall area. The use of mirrored or tinted glass with light transmittance of less
than 40% is prohibited.
Along street facades, all exterior building walls and structures shall be constructed with durable
materials, such as masonry, stone, brick, finished wood, cement fiber clapboard, stucco or glass.
Evidence should be submitted that demonstrates that the exterior building material has sufficient
impact resistance at the pedestrian level to withstand normal wear.
No more than three exterior building materials shall be used on any one side of a building.
Changes in materials shall occur at inside corners. Material changes at the outside corners or in a
plane shall be avoided.
On corner lots, the primary facade of commercial buildings shall be oriented to face the principal
street rather than side streets.
The front facade and main entrance shall face a public street and shall have a direct pedestrian
connection to the street.
§ 300-56.4. Transitions to residential uses.
All commercial and industrial development shall employ building and site design standards to ensure
compatibility with adjacent residential development. To the maximum extent practicable, commercial
and industrial development shall employ a minimum of four of the following techniques when
developed adjacent to a residential use:
Use similar building setback.
Use similar building height.
Use similar roof form.
Use similar exterior materials.
Mitigate the larger mass of commercial buildings with facade articulation.
Provide green/open space.
Use small green spaces, courts, squares, parks, plazas, and similar spaces.
Use existing natural features as transitions, including natural differences in topography (not
retaining walls), streams, existing stands of trees, and similar features. When existing natural
features are used as transitions, the Town or Villages may still require that adequate
pedestrian connections to adjacent land uses be accommodated.
Article 57. Central Business District Design Standards
§ 300-57.1. Applicability.
These standards and guidelines shall be applied to nonresidential development in the Central
Business District of the Villages.

New construction shall be or appear to be two stories in height and no greater than three stories in
height.
New construction or remodeling shall incorporate a roof form which reflects the adjacent late 19th
or early 20th century buildings. Flat roof slopes shall slope to the back and will have a decorative
cornice at the top of the building. Peaked or gable roofs shall have significant overhangs and
decorative brackets are encouraged.
Entry points shall be located to afford direct access from the sidewalk. Corner buildings may have
two separate entry points or a single entry point at the corner.
All of the facades of the building which face a public street shall be architecturally consistent (i.e.,
building materials, style, etc.) with each other.
§ 300-57.3. Facades.
Building facades shall reflect the late 19th or early 20th century style of the Villages.
The pedestrian zone (two feet to eight feet above the sidewalk) shall have a minimum of 60%
clear glass. Opaque or heavily tinted glass is not permitted.
The pedestrian zone should not be obscured to allow visual access to the interior of the building.

treatments such as curtains or blinds) shall be permitted.
A minimum of 25% of the facade for the upper floor shall incorporate transparent glass openings.
Existing windows shall not be covered up or changed in size unless the proposed change is part
of an effort to restore the original appearance of the building.
No external security devices (coiling shutters, accordion gates, etc.) shall be utilized. Alternative
security systems, such as lighting, alarms, and interior barriers, are to be used when necessary.
A visual separation shall be provided between the first and second story of a building. This
element may consist of decorative trim, awnings, or a change of material that creates added relief
in order to add a shadow line that delineates the end of the first story.
Large buildings, greater than 40 feet in width, shall be designed to look like multiple smaller
buildings.
§ 300-57.4. Materials.
All new construction or remodeling that is visible from the public right-of-way shall utilize materials
that appear to be smaller in scale, such as brick or clapboard. Larger-scale materials, such as
concrete block, shall be limited to the rear of the building.
Brick selected for new construction or renovation shall reflect the surrounding late 19th or early
20th century buildings.

Awnings shall be consistent with materials used in the late 19th or early 20th century (i.e., canvas,
wood, etc.).
If awnings are placed on a facade, they shall be consistent with the shape of the window that they
are located over. For example, an awning placed over an arched window shall be arched and an
awning placed over a rectangular window shall be a flat-topped awning.
Awnings shall have a triangular or curved profile.
Awnings may not be backlit.
Doors should allow visual access to the interior of the building. If the door is solid, it shall be multipanel.
All doors shall be painted or stained to accent the building.
§ 300-57.6. Signage.
These following requirements are intended to augment the sign regulations outlined in Article 52. In
cases where there are conflicting requirements, this section shall take precedence.
Signage must be located in a manner that creates a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere. Methods to
be encouraged are: attached to the facade of the building, hanging signs suspended above the
sidewalk, or placement on an awning.
The size and location of the signs should respect the architectural elements of the building.
Signs painted or posted on the interior of storefront windows should not obstruct visual access to
the interior of the building.
Temporary signs should be designed and placed in a manner that does not obscure visual access
to the interior of the building.
Pole signs are prohibited within the CB District. Detached signs shall consist of a monument sign
no taller than five feet in height and constructed using materials that are consistent with § 300-
57.4.
Perpendicular signs are permitted. Perpendicular sign shall not project more than five feet from
the facade of the building to which it is attached. There must be a minimum of nine feet of
clearance between the bottom of the sign and the sidewalk. The maximum size of a perpendicular
sign is 16 square feet.

Article 64. Nonconforming Uses
§ 300-64.1. Purpose.
Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments, there exist lots, buildings, uses of land
and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter or amendments were passed but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under terms of this chapter or future amendments.
Regulations for the continuance, maintenance, repair, restoration and discontinuance of
nonconforming lots, buildings, land and uses are established for the following purposes:
To permit these nonconformities to continue, but to minimize any adverse effect on adjoining
properties and development.
To regulate their maintenance and repair.
To restrict their rebuilding if substantially destroyed.
To require their permanent discontinuance if not operated for certain periods.
To require conformity if they are discontinued, and to bring about the eventual compliance with the
objectives of the Future Land Use Plan and this chapter.
§ 300-64.2. Exceptions.
Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration in and reconstruction or enlargement of a building
with nonconforming bulk are permitted, as well as new construction on the lot, if the same does not
increase the degree of or create any new nonconforming bulk in such building.

§ 300-64.3. General provisions.
Repair and alteration. Normal maintenance and repair of and incidental alteration to a building
occupied by a nonconforming use are permitted if they do not extend the nonconforming use. No
structural alteration or enlargement shall be made in a building occupied by a nonconforming use,
except where required by law, i.e., court ordered, or to adapt a building to a conforming use or to
any other use permitted under Subsection B or in a building occupied by a nonconforming use
permitted to extend under Subsection C.
Change of use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use
nor shall a conforming use be changed to a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use when
changed to a conforming use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use, building or structure shall not be enlarged except upon the issuance of a
variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Extension or enlargement of nonconforming use. Extension or enlargement shall mean:
The enlargement of such building so as to create additional floor space.
The extension within any existing building to any portion of the floor area not formerly used for
such nonconforming use, except where such additional floor area was manifestly designed for
such use at the time such use became nonconforming.
The extension of the use to any area outside of the building.
In the case of a nonconforming, nonbuilding land use, the use of any additional land on which
no substantial operations were previously conducted, provided that any such extension or
enlargement is on the same lot occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective date of
this chapter.
To the extent the district bulk requirements permit, upon the approval of the Zoning Board of
Appeals, a nonconforming use may be extended to, but not exceed, an increase of 50% of its
floor area or of its land area occupancy of a nonbuilding use. However, this provision may be
used only once for each such use and in no event may be applied to signs or to increase the
number of units in a multifamily building.
An accessory building(s) to a legally existing nonconforming residential use, in a
nonresidential zoning district, is permitted by right, provided that the accessory building(s)
meets the minimum side/rear yard requirement for the district in which the property is located
and provided that the accessory building complies with all other requirements for such
buildings.
Damage and destruction. If a building occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged to the extent
of 50% or more of its assessed valuation, excluding the full value of the land, as determined by the
Town Assessor, such building may be repaired, provided that substantial work is undertaken within
one year after such damage; otherwise, such building shall thereafter be occupied only by a
conforming use and structure. This provision shall not prevent the repair of a nonconforming
building damaged to the extent of less than 50% of its assessed valuation.
Discontinuance or abandoning of use. A nonconforming use or building discontinued or
abandoned for 12 consecutive months shall not, thereafter, be used or occupied except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Discontinuance of the active
and continuous operation of a nonconforming use, or a part or portion thereof, for a period of 12
consecutive months is hereby construed and considered to be an abandonment of such
nonconforming use, regardless of any reservation of intent not to abandon same or of intent to
resume active operations. Actual abandonment is evidenced by the removal of buildings,

structures, machinery, equipment and other evidence of such nonconforming use of the land and
premises.
Nonconforming parking, loading, and stacking facilities. A building, use or occupancy lawfully
existing at the time this chapter or any amendment thereto becomes effective, but which does not
conform to the off-street parking, loading and stacking requirements, may be occupied or
continued without such facilities being provided. Any such spaces that may be provided thereafter
shall comply with the requirements of Article 51. If an existing building, use or occupancy is altered
so that there is an increase in the number of dwelling units, seating capacity, employees or floor
area, or if the use is changed to one requiring more off-street parking, loading and stacking
spaces, the number of such spaces shall be provided at least equal to the number required for the
increased area of the building or use in accordance with all provisions of Article 51.
Nonconforming lots. No parcel or lot, after the adoption of this chapter or amendment thereto,
shall be used or divided in a manner which prevents or diminishes compliance with the
requirements established by this chapter or amendments thereto. Lots subdivided prior to the
adoption of this chapter or any amendment and not meeting the minimum lot size requirements
may be built upon, provided that the bulk requirements for any use within the district are met
except as provided in this chapter.
Article 65. Planned Unit Development District (PUD)
§ 300-65.1. Purpose.
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning District allows for an alternative process to develop a
unified and integrated development plan in the Town or Villages. PUD Zoning Districts promote flexible
development opportunities that would not otherwise be possible through the strict application of the
land use and development regulations of this chapter, and allow diversification in the uses permitted
and variation in the relationship of uses, structures, and open spaces. The PUD District results in a
cohesive and unified project based on unique standards and regulations developed for a particular site
or sites. Planned Unit Development Districts shall achieve the following objectives:
An alternative development pattern in harmony with the objectives of various Town, Village and
regional land use and development plans.
A creative use of land and related physical development allowing an orderly transition from one
land use to another.
Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the relationship of uses, structures, open
spaces and height of structures in developments conceived as cohesive unified projects.
Unique standards for site and building design.
The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics, such as open space, natural
topography, vegetation and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion.
To encourage a more efficient and economical arrangement of land uses, buildings, circulation
system and utilities, resulting in a smaller network of utilities and streets and a lessened burden of
traffic on streets and highways.
§ 300-65.2. Location.
The Planned Unit Development District shall be applicable to any area of the Town or Villages where
the applicant can demonstrate that the characteristics of the development will satisfy the intent and
objectives of this chapter. Where a PUD District is deemed appropriate, the rezoning of land to a

Planned Unit Development District will replace all uses and dimensional specifications contained
elsewhere in this chapter. The PUD District shall be defined as all contiguous parcels zoned PUD
including associated streets or rights-of-way. A planned unit development plan must be reviewed and
approved on an individual basis, separately from neighboring planned unit developments.
§ 300-65.3. District ownership.
All owners of the parcel or parcels included in the planned unit development plan (PUD plan) shall be
included as joint applicants on the initial PUD application.
§ 300-65.4. Area requirements.
No Planned Unit Development District shall be established having an area of less than 10
contiguous acres within the Town or two contiguous acres within the Villages.
Open space requirements for individual PUD plans.
Not less than 25% of the total area shall be set aside for common open space. In general,
open space shall achieve the following:
Protect and preserve floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, or watercourses, etc.
Protect any historic, archeological or cultural resources listed on the national, state,
county, or local historical registers.
Protect any mature woodlands, meadows, or ecologically sensitive areas for wildlife
habitat.
Provide an upland buffer area adjacent to any streams, wetlands, or surface water to
protect native species vegetation.
Landscape common areas such as islands and new streets.
Open space intended for recreation or public use shall be so located to be accessible to
pedestrians.
The suitability of open space for recreational or public use shall be determined by its
visibility from a significant number of units or length or number of public or private streets.
Disposition requirements.
Ownership shall be held by the developer(s), or in corporate ownership by the owners of
the lots or dwelling units within the development, if the open space is reserved for private
use.
Such common open space shall be set aside as a deed restriction for a specific period of
time or conservation easement in perpetual ownership. The maintenance of common
open space and recreation areas and maintenance and replacement of approved
landscaping shall be guaranteed in a form approved by the Municipal Attorney.
Lands dedicated as open space, park, or recreation shall be noted on the plat map, deed
description filed and referenced.
The legal instruments used to convey ownership, use, and maintenance shall be
established and filed of record, prior to the conveyance of any subdivision lots.

§ 300-65.8. PUD District process.
Purpose. The provisions of this section establish special procedures for amending this chapter to
permit the mapping of Planned Unit Development Districts. The procedures herein established are
intended to substitute procedural protections for substantive regulations in recognition of the fact
that traditional density, bulk, spacing and use regulations, which may be useful in protecting the
character of substantially developed and stable areas, may impose inappropriate preregulations
and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas which lend themselves
to an individual, planned approach.
Authority. The Zoning Map may be amended from time to time, by local law duly enacted by the
governing body, to provide for Planned Unit Development Districts; provided, however, that no
such amendment shall be enacted except in accordance with procedures herein established and
the applicable standards and regulations established by Article 63, Site Plan Review, and Chapter
181, Subdivision of Land, in the Town's Code and Chapter 244, Subdivision of Land, in the
Johnson City Code.
General overview of procedure. The following outlines the process required to obtain approval for
a Planned Unit Development District in the Town or Village. In general, the process includes the
following steps; additional information on each step is outlined in this section.
Step 1: conceptual development plan approval (optional). The applicant submits a conceptual
development plan and discusses the information on an informal basis with the Planning
Director, Code Enforcement Officer, and Municipal Engineer. Following the review of the
concept plan, the Planning Director has the discretion to present the concept plan to the
Planning Board and governing body for comment.
Step 2: preliminary development plan approval. The applicant submits a preliminary
development plan to the Planning Board (along with a rezoning application to the governing
body) for an advisory opinion. The plans are transmitted to the governing body for approval or
denial of the rezoning and preliminary plan following a public hearing by the governing body, if
applicable.
Step 3: final development plan review. The applicant incorporates conditions into plans for
final development site plan or subdivision plat review by the Planning Board. If the plans are
in substantial conformity, final approval is granted.
Procedure.
Conceptual development plan approval (optional). The applicant has the option to discuss the
proposal with the Planning Department by submitting a conceptual development plan. The
following outlines the conceptual development plan approval process.
The plan should include the following information: proposed uses, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation system, building placement, existing and proposed utilities,
drainage and proposed private and public open space.
The plan will be reviewed by the Planning, Code Enforcement and Engineering
Departments, as appropriate, which may meet jointly to discuss the project.
The conceptual plan review may be placed on the Planning Board's agenda at its
regularly scheduled meeting to discuss the review process and offer recommendations
for the plan.

The applicant may, at its option, submit the preliminary development plan in lieu of a lessdetailed
conceptual development plan with the submission of the Planned Unit
Development District rezoning application and planned unit development plan
application. In such case, the applicant shall comply with all provisions of this chapter
applicable to submission of the preliminary development plan and to submission of the
final development plan.
The Planning Department and Planning Board may offer recommendations and
suggestions on potential issues and alterations that should be considered by the
applicant. The applicant can use this information in preparing the preliminary
development plan as part of the application process.
Preliminary development plan review. The preliminary development plan offers the applicant
the opportunity to provide preliminary details to the Planning Department and Planning Board
on the design and layout of the project. By providing the preliminary site layout, circulation
patterns, densities, setbacks and other proposed regulations, the applicant will have the
opportunity to discuss and amend the preliminary development plan before finalizing the PUD
plan.
Submission of preliminary development plan.
The applicant shall submit 15 sets of preliminary professional drawings/plans, the
PUD application form, the rezoning petition form, the long EAF, the project narrative,
and the application fee as defined under Code to the Planning Department.
The Planning Department will refer the PUD/rezoning application to:
The Planning Board for its advisory opinion, and
The Town/Village Board. The Town/Village Board shall:
Declare lead agency for the rezoning.
Refer the application back to the Planning Department to commence the
239 review, if required, and distribute the plans and application to other
interested agencies, including Engineering, Water Department, Fire
Department, and Code Enforcement. (At this time, the Planning Department
may ask for additional copies of the plans, as justified and needed for
review by other interested agencies.)
If the development requires the subdivision of land or installation of public streets
and/or utilities, an application for subdivision approval can be made. The preliminary
development plans shall be subject to the applicable sections under Chapter 181,
Subdivision of Land, in the Town Code and Chapter 244, Subdivision of Land, in the
Johnson City Code.
The review procedures for rezoning, PUD and site plan/subdivision plat can run
concurrently, with the applicant acknowledging that the property is still subject to
rezoning approval.
Action by Planning Board.
The Planning Board shall review and study the preliminary development plan and
consider the comments of other agencies.
Within 60 days of receiving the preliminary development plan application, the
Planning Board shall make its recommendations on the preliminary development
plan. The recommendation can include one of the following:

Approve the plans as submitted.
Approve the preliminary plans with conditions. The Planning Board may impose
changes or conditions, which shall be incorporated into the final plans.
Disapprove of the plans. In the event of disapproval of the preliminary PUD
plans, the Planning Board shall state its reasons for opposition in writing.
The failure of the Planning Board to act within 60 days, or such longer period as may
be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval
of the preliminary development plan as submitted.
The Planning Board shall transmit its recommendation to the governing body for
consideration in the rezoning application made as part of the preliminary
development plan application for the property.
Action by governing body.
The governing body shall follow regulations under SEQRA.
Make a SEQR determination of type of action (if Type I, determine whether an
EIS or long EAF will suffice).
If EIS is not required, call for a public hearing to be held following the thirty-day
review period. (The Planning Department will prepare public notices for paper
and sign posting to be posted a minimum of 10 days prior to hearing, and will
prepare Part II of EAF.)
The governing body shall review and study the preliminary development plan and
consider the comments of other agencies. Attention will be given to the arrangement
of uses and buildings, the relationship to the topography of the land, other factors,
such as vegetation, wetlands, floodplains, sewage disposal, drainage, water needs,
trip generation, recreation/open space areas and such concerns as may be
appropriate.
Following the thirty-day 239 review period, if required, and receipt by the governing
body of the report of the Planning Board, or its failure to act as above provided, the
governing body shall conduct a public hearing on the preliminary development plan
and rezoning application.

provided, the Planning Director shall:
Mail notice of the decision to all parties entitled.
File a copy of the entire preliminary development plan in the permanent records
of the Planning Department.

shall not be amended until the applicant has filed with the Planning Director written
consent to such conditions.
In the event that a preliminary development plan is approved, or approved with
conditions acceptable to the applicant, no development shall be permitted unless

with the provisions of this chapter.
Final development plan approval. The final development plan incorporates the specific
conditions outlined during the preliminary development plan approval process. Inclusion of the
approval conditions will allow the project to move forward in a timely manner; the application
process includes a mechanism to streamline the approval so the project can move forward.
All final development plan approvals shall require site plan approval as set forth in Article
63, Site Plan Review, of this chapter. If applicable, both processes can run concurrently.
If the Planning Board finds substantial conformity and finds the final development plan to
be in all other respects complete and in compliance with any conditions imposed by
approval of the preliminary development plan, the Planning Board shall approve the final
development plan. A final development plan shall be deemed not to be in substantial
conformity with an approved preliminary development plan if it:
Exceeds by more than 10% the maximum parking, height, lot coverage, yard
requirements or changes in land use percentages (besides arrangement of land
use), approved for the preliminary Planned Unit Development plan;
Changes in housing type;
Reduction in open space;
Decreases by more than 10% the area approved for public and private open space
or significantly changes the general location of such areas;
Substantially relocates approved public circulation elements to any extent that would
significantly decrease their functionality; adversely affect their relation to surrounding
lands and circulation elements; or significantly reduce their effectiveness as buffers
or amenities;
Significantly alters the arrangement of land uses within the Planned Unit
Development District;
Provides for uses not included in the approved preliminary development plan; or
Exceeds the maximum density for residential uses, as approved on the preliminary
plan, and the maximum floor area ratio for nonresidential uses.
Any changes to the proposed phasing plan submitted with the preliminary plan shall be
submitted with the final development plan.

If expressly authorized by the approval of the final development plan, the applicant may,
pursuant to and subject to the limitations of the applicable codes and ordinances of the
Town, apply for and receive building permits for model buildings, residential or
commercial, that would be used for the express purpose of showing typical structures to
be developed in the PUD. These buildings can only be constructed within the area of the
Planned Unit Development District as approved and upon issuance of a building permit.
Within one year of approval of the final development plan, or a time frame agreed to by
the Planning Board and the applicant, the applicant shall make application for appropriate
building permits for the planned unit development.

considerations first discovered during actual development. Such minor adjustments shall be
limited to the following:
Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures by not more than 10 feet or
0.1 of the distance shown on the final development plan between such structure or structures
and any other structure or any vehicular circulation element or any boundary of the Planned
Unit Development District, whichever is less.
Altering the location of any circulation element by not more than 10 feet or 0.1 of the distance
shown on the final development plan between such circulation element or any structure,
whichever is less.
Altering the boundary of any open space (other than dedicated open space) by not more than
50 feet, provided that the total amount of open space is not reduced by more than 5%.
Reducing the yard area or open space associated with any single structure by not more than
5%.
Altering any final grade by not more than 5% of the originally planned grade.
Amendments to final development plan. In addition to the adjustments authorized by the Planning
Department, an approved final development plan may be amended or varied by submitting a new
site plan to the Planning Board. The process for final development plan approval shall be followed
for all amendments.
Approval revoked. The following changes to an approved Planned Unit Development District are
considered significant, and any approval of the PUD District shall be revoked and the approval
process begun again. Revisions for which this shall apply include:
Any change which shall require additional roads or utilities or cause the required number of
parking spaces to increase by 15% or more or will cause any change in the SEQR
determination.
Any reduction in common or public open space (other than dedicated open space) by more
than 15%.

established by the approved development schedule, construction shall commence in accordance
with such approved plan.

granted, automatically render void the final development plan approval and all permits based on
such approvals. In addition, such documents shall require time expiration and reverter language to
remedy nonperformance.
§ 300-65.11. Enforcement.
If the Building Official finds that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved
schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the final development plan as finally
approved, he/she shall immediately notify the governing body of such fact and issue an order
stopping any or all work on the Planned Unit Development District until such time as any
noncompliance is cured.

Revoke, by local law, the final development plan approval and direct the Building Official to
initiate appropriate amendment procedures to return the affected area of the Planned Unit
Development District to an appropriate zoning classification;

unnecessary hardships or practical difficulties;
