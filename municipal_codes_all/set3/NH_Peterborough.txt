ARTICLE I – General Provisions 
§ 233-1. Authority 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Planning Board by the voters of the Town of Peterborough on March 9, 1971 and re-authorized on March 10, 1981, and in accordance with RSA 674:43 and 44, the Planning Board adopts the following rules governing the development or change or expansion of use of tracts for nonresidential uses, multi-family residential developments, or common land associated with condominium developments as may be applicable. 
§ 233-2.  Purpose 
A. 	The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that development: 
1. 	
does not impose unreasonable costs upon the community; 

2. 	
does not exceed the development capacity of the site or the capacity of community resources and infrastructure; 

3. 	
will not unreasonably impact adjacent properties; 

4. 	
will increase the site’s resistance to natural hazards; 

5. 	
will avoid erosion, sedimentation, and flooding; 

6. 	
will provide safe and attractive streets, driveways, parking areas; 

7. 	
will not generate harmful noise, light, dust, or other nuisances, pollutants, or hazards; 

8. 	
will protect rivers, streams, wetlands, floodplains, and drinking water supplies; 

9. 	
fits with surrounding land and buildings, preserves, and is consistent with the architectural heritage of Peterborough; and 

10. 	
will create conditions favorable for health, safety, convenience, and prosperity. 


B. 	It is also the intent of these regulations to simplify the development process; to provide explicit guidelines as to what the Town does and does not want; and to provide a greater degree of flexibility in meeting the Town’s objectives. 

§233-3.  Applicability (Amended February 18, 2015) 
When any development or change or expansion of use of land is proposed, site plan approval is required before any construction, land clearing, building development or change is begun, and before any permits are granted. When there is any question as to whether a project requires Site Plan Review, the Planning Board has the responsibility for making that determination.  In order to clarify what constitutes a change of use of sufficient magnitude or impact to trigger Planning Board action, the following guidelines will be observed. 
A. 	Activities That Require Site Plan Review by the Planning Board or its designee 
1. 	
New construction of non-residential or multi-family development. 

2. 	
A change of use (e.g. from residential to commercial, or one-or two-family to multi-family). 

3. 	
Projects that entail the development, change, or expansion of more than two thousand (2,000) square feet of buildings, structures, or parking area, including filling, excavation, grading or clearing of any land. 

4. 	
On a Commercial Farm: 


a. 	
Farm stand in excess of 1000 ft2 of area.  When no greater than 2000 ft2 in area, the proposal shall be subject to administrative site plan review by the Code Enforcement Officer as set forth in §233-3.C.4 below. 

b. 	
Community Supported Agriculture operation, “U-pick” operation, or other on-farm distribution operation, all subject to site plan review as set forth in §233-3.C.4 below. 

c.

ii. 	Farm to Table Café 
iii. 	Event Venue for hosting events and activities with more than 30 participants, not including farm staff.  
iv. 	Incidental Farm Related Activity or Amenity that expands to a point where it ceases to be incidental and becomes a significant draw to the commercial farm in its own right. 
Particular consideration shall be given to provisions for parking, pedestrian safety, directional signage, noise, odors, smoke, lighting and provision of sanitary facilities. The Planning Board or the Minor Site Plan Review Committee may waive or modify provisions of the Site Plan Regulations if, in the judgment of the Board such waivers or modifications will: properly carry out the spirit and intent of the regulations and the zoning ordinance; ensure the rural character of the neighborhood will be maintained; and ensure public safety is maintained. The Planning Board shall take care to avoid the application of site plan standards or design requirements that are inappropriate for or degrade the rural character of the setting. 
B. 	Activities That Do Not Require Site Plan Review 
1. 	
One-and two-family residential development (except where new street or shared utility development is proposed.) 

2. 	
Internal building modifications to a non-residential use that do not affect the scale or impact of the existing use.

4. 	
Commercial Agriculture and any permitted accessory uses as defined in §245-4 and set forth in §245-8 of the Peterborough Zoning Ordinance, except as specifically identified in §233­


3.A.4 above. 
C. 	Activities That May Be Reviewed and Approved by Staff. 
1. 	
The Community Development Director may approve changes to an approved Site Plan as a result of minor errors in construction. 

2. 	
The Community Development Director may approve changes to an approved Site Plan of a minor nature that do not affect any of the anticipated impacts of the project. 

3. 	
The Community Development Director may approve an initial time extension for meeting conditions of plan approval, for commencing construction of an approved Site Plan, and for completing construction of an approved site plan. Such extensions shall not exceed six months for meeting conditions of approval or one year for commencing or completing construction. Subsequent requests for extension must be approved by the Planning Board.

ARTICLE VII – Post Approval Procedures 
§233-37. Off-Site Improvements 
A. 	Pursuant to RSA 674:21, V (j), it is the intent of the Town that the uses allowed by the zoning ordinance are permitted with the overriding condition that there be adequate capacity on the site and within the Town to absorb the impacts that such development may generate. The Town wants to protect itself from unsafe conditions, excessive public expenditure of funds, and usage demands beyond the capacity of the Town’s road, sewer, water or drainage systems. 
B. 	Planning Board Guidelines for Off-Site Improvements. 
(1) 	
The Board shall utilize objective factual data to determine what, if any, off-site problems will be associated with a proposed development, relative to highway, drainage, sewer and water upgrades.  

(2) 	
If the Board determines that off-site deficiencies exist which must be improved as part of a proposed development, that the developer will not be able to correct those deficiencies, and that the payment of off-site improvement fees will not result in the correction of those deficiencies, the Board shall have the authority to deny the proposed development. 


§233-38. Off-Site Improvement Fees 
A. 	The Planning Board may collect fees towards off-site improvements rather than require that those improvements be undertaken by the developer only when, in the judgment of the Board, the following conditions exist: 
1. 	
There is a serious off-site issue that needs to be corrected in order to assure that a proposed development will not exceed the existing capacity of roads, water, sewer, or drainage systems, nor create hazards such as flooding or fire, nor otherwise impose excessive public expense. 

2. 	
The necessary improvement(s) require expense beyond that which can reasonably be attributed to the proposed development.  

3. 	
The fees to be collected can reasonably be expected to result in the necessary improvements, and that those improvements can reasonably be expected to be completed within five (5) years of the date of the payment of the fee. 


B. 	Any fees collected under the provisions of this section shall be administered by the Office of Community Development in conjunction with the Public Works Department. 
§233-39. Inspections 
All required site improvements shall be subject to inspection by the Town of Peterborough and/or its properly assigned agents.

B. 	If an applicant feels that additional time is required beyond one hundred twenty (120) days, a different schedule of compliance must be formally requested at the time of application.  Unless the Board specifically approves a different compliance schedule, the one hundred twenty (120) day limit shall apply.  If an applicant makes a good faith effort to complete established conditions but is unable to comply with the one hundred twenty (120) day deadline, a request for an extension must be submitted to the Planning Board at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) day period. The Board shall determine whether a reasonable effort has been made to comply and shall then determine what if any extension is adequate. 
§233-42. Expiration of Approval 
A. 	Once the Chairman of the Planning Board signs a site plan, the applicant has twelve (12) months from the date of signing to start construction and, unless a different schedule is approved by the Board, must complete construction within twenty-four (24) months. 
B. 	Site Plan approvals that have not started construction within twelve (12) months shall automatically expire, at which time no building permits shall be issued, unless an extension has been formally requested and granted by the Board.  Normally the Board shall not grant more than one extension per project, shall only grant an extension for reasonable cause, and shall normally not grant an extension for more than six (6) months. 
C. 	Approved site plans are protected from future changes in regulations and ordinances in accordance with RSA 674:39. 

§233-43. Site Plan Modification

i. 	
A functional analysis of any wetland areas proposed to be disturbed must be submitted. The functions of wildlife habitat, stormwater control, groundwater recharge, sediment entrapment, pollution removal, and flood control are of particular concern, but all functions must be addressed.  


ii. 	The analysis must identify the functions taking place prior to disturbance and the impact on those functions that will result if the proposed project is constructed. 
June 12, 2017 
– Page 22 
b. 	
Stormwater Management 

i. 	
No surface runoff can be directly discharged into adjacent wetlands without preliminary treatment, especially to capture sediment and “first flush” flows. 


ii. 	
Existing site hydrology must not be modified so as to disrupt adjacent wetland hydrology. Adequate flow must be maintained. The applicant must provide evidence that this standard can be achieved and maintained over time. 

c. 	
Low Impact Development Techniques.  In considering any application for a Conditional Use Permit, the Board will take into consideration the use of any Low Impact Development Techniques recognized by the NH Department of Environmental Services, including but not limited to the following:

ii. 	Any mitigation measures must address impacts during construction, impacts after construction, and how any mitigation measures will be enforced over time. 
2. 	
Where streets, roads, access ways, driveways and utility rights-of-way or easements are proposed that would cross a buffer, the Board will consider whether the crossing is essential to the productive use of the land outside of the WPOZ and that no better alternative exists.  In any case, every effort shall be made to minimize any detrimental impact on the WPOZ. 

3. 	
Steep Slope Adjustments. If the buffer contains an area that has a slope of 10% or more for more than 10 linear feet in a direction perpendicular to the edge of the wetlands, the property owner may be required to increase the amount of buffer area, as shown below. In no case shall there be any net loss in shoreline or bank stabilization due to disturbance, erosion, or loss of vegetation of the land bordering the wetland, watercourse, lake, or pond. In addition, steps shall be taken to repair existing point erosion or lack of vegetation within the impact area of the project upon the resource area’s shoreline or bank.  In making the determination, the Board will take into consideration opportunities to mitigate or minimize the impact of the slope.  


Side Slope (%) 	Additional Buffer Distance 
10 – 19.9% 	10% increase 
20 – 29.9% 	15% increase 
30 – 39.9% 	20% increase 
40% or steeper 	25% increase 
4. 	In addition to the Performance Standards specified above, the applicant or the Planning Board may rely on an assessment of the functional values of the wetland(s) in question in order to determine the most appropriate and best management techniques for the overall proposal.

APPENDIX A: 
BUILDING DESIGN 
A. 	Purpose and Applicability: In order to "... provide for the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the municipality and its environs..." (NHRSA 674:44, II (b)), these regulations are intended to preserve the distinctive appearance of Peterborough, and implement a vision of the Town that has been expressed through the Master Plan process. The Planning Board believes that by implementing these regulations, the character of Peterborough will be preserved, the property values will be maintained, and the community with benefit overall from aesthetically pleasing development. 
B. 	It is the intent that these guidelines shall apply only to commercial development.  However, the Board reserves the right to review other non-residential or multi-family developments under this section, as it deems reasonable. 
C. 	General Guidelines: An application is considered to meet the aesthetic considerations of these regulations if the Planning Board, in its judgment, determines that the application overall demonstrates reasonable conformity with the Purpose, above, and the General Guidelines that follow. Following are photographic examples of Design Elements of buildings located in Peterborough, offered for consideration by the Board. 
1. 	
Recognizing that every property, every proposal, and every situation is unique, the Planning Board may waive, modify, or soften any of the standards herein as it reasonably deems appropriate, based upon the individual circumstances of any application. No particular style is stipulated and innovative, contemporary, and distinctive designs are encouraged, provided they are respectful of general design principles and context. 

2. 	
It is recognized that many national and regional chain businesses seek to build a standard design across the country or region without regard to local conditions. However, the Planning Board will evaluate all proposed designs for their compatibility with our own local community character and for conformance with the purpose of these regulations. It shall be the obligation of the applicants to develop designs that are compatible with our community character; the Town of Peterborough need not make adjustments to accommodate these template designs. 

3. 	
Buildings should be compatible with traditional New England architecture. They should be articulated to express an architectural identity, will be handsome and dignified and significant enough to be worth saving into the future. 

4. 	
Buildings should possess an overall integrity. Architectural details should not give the impression of being tacked on but rather should be integral to the overall design. (For example, use of undersized shutters on a picture window or installation of an elaborate classical portico or cupola on an otherwise clearly utilitarian big box would be discouraged.) 

5. 	
The reuse of existing structures that have special architectural, historical, cultural, or contextual value by the applicant is strongly encouraged. 

6. 	
Modifications and additions to existing buildings should be harmonious with the character of the existing building when the existing building would reasonably be considered to be in general conformance with the goals of these regulations. 


D. 	Design Elements: The purpose of these standards is to encourage architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional New England examples. Building design should reinforce a human-scaled environment through careful consideration of architectural forms, massing, detailing, number and use of materials, and color. The Planning Board strongly encourages consideration of these design elements. 
June 12, 2017 – Page 30 
E. 	Roofs. Monotony of design or warehouse style structures shall be avoided.  Variation in detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual interest.  In order to prevent the construction of warehouse style buildings (i.e. long horizontal roof lines), all new buildings and additions should be pitched roofs or gabled roofs, where practical. Shed, gambrel and barn style roofs are also acceptable.  Roofs should have appropriate overhangs.  Dormers are encouraged. 
F. 	Building materials.  Exterior surfaces of building should be covered with traditional materials or products which simulate natural materials, including but not limited to clapboards, shingles, stone, brick, or architectural concrete masonry units.  Exposed plain cinder block, corrugated steel, sheet plastic, or sheet fiberglass are not acceptable. Pitched roofs should be constructed of shingles, metal roofing, or other materials traditionally used in this region.   
G. 	Awnings. Brightly colored or illuminated franchise type awnings are not acceptable.  Awnings may be made of transparent materials (glass or clear Plexiglas type products).  Awning covers designed for shade should be made of fabric or simulated fabric-like material. 
H. 	Architectural details. Balconies, decks, covered porches, decorative shingles, bracketed eaves, columns, balustrades, towers, turrets, skylights, and arches are among the details to be considered and encouraged.  All features and details should be in proportions with the building. 
I. 	Windows. Windows should be incorporated on front and side facades to humanize the building.  It is preferable that the windows be vertical or at least no more squat than square.  The use of large picture-type windows for first-floor retail uses is strongly encouraged.  Windows may be used for either interior illumination or for display purposes. 
J. 	Entrances. Articulation of the entrance is encouraged through the use of a portico, canopy, awning, sidelights, surround, or other device. 
K. 	Fencing.  Fences made of traditional New England materials are encouraged. (i.e. picket, split rail, wrought iron, brick, stone).  Chain link security fences may be allowed where appropriate, but their use is generally discouraged. 
L. 	Color. Subtle, neutral colors should be used on larger, plain buildings. Paint colors should relate to the natural colors of building materials, such as brick, stucco, etc.  Complimentary colors on architectural details are encouraged, as are historic colors.  Bright, franchise colors are discouraged.

APPENDIX B: 
PARKING 

A. Parking Design. 
1. 	
The parking requirements contained in the Peterborough Zoning Ordinance are minimum standards. The Board may require additional parking spaces. 

2. 	
Parking lots shall be designed so as to assure safe flow of vehicles and pedestrians, to allow unobstructed access for emergency vehicles, and so as to be visually attractive. 

3. 	
The Board shall normally not approve parking which backs directly onto a public street. 

4. 	
Loading.  Loading zones shall be located so they will not interfere with the public use of sidewalks, streets, or parking areas. 

5. 	
Surfacing.  All parking areas and driveways thereto shall be paved or graveled for year-round use and must be graded and drained so as to carry off all surface water. Pervious surfaces are encouraged for parking areas, unless there are overriding environmental limitations, or the parking is intended to serve a high traffic-volume area (<500 ADT). 

6. 	
Bicycle and Pedestrian Accommodations. 


a. 	
All parking lots shall be designed to provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access. 

b. 	
A minimum of one bicycle parking space shall be provided for each 20 off-street parking spaces. 

c. 	
Safe and convenient pedestrian access shall be provided by such features as well-articulated crosswalks, separation of walkways from motor vehicle traffic, and lighting. 


7. 	
Every attempt shall be made to locate parking lots to the side and/or rear of the building. 

8. 	
Parking lot lighting shall comply with the provisions of §245-33D. 


B. 	Parking Lot Landscaping. 
Purpose: Landscaping in a parking lot enhances the visual environment; protects and preserves the appearance, character, and value of surrounding areas; promotes public safety by guiding vehicles and pedestrians within a site; moderates heat, wind, and other local climatic effects produced by parking lots; and minimizes nuisances such as noise and glare. To achieve those purposes, all parking lots containing ten (10) or more parking spaces shall be required to be landscaped as follows: 
1. 	
Perimeter Requirements. Landscaping in perimeter setbacks is intended primarily to screen parked vehicles from the roadways or abutting properties, and secondarily to enhance the visual quality of the development.  Perimeter landscaping may include but not be limited to: low berms covered with groundcover, small shrubs, flowers, etc.; low hedges of plants suitable for creating a dense screen; or low fences; provided that the type of landscaping relied upon for screening shall be at least three (3) feet in height and no greater than four (4) feet in height at maturity; or a combination of those types of screens with taller bushes or trees. Existing trees shall be saved whenever possible.  Additional trees or groups of trees shall be planted to provide shade and visual breaks in the parking lot. 

2. 	
Interior requirements. At least ten percent (10%) of the interior area shall be unpaved planting areas, each forty (40) square feet or larger, providing at least one (1) tree per eight 


(8) parking spaces or fraction thereof, with a diameter of at least two (2) inches as measured 
June 12, 2017 
– Page 36 
4.5 feet from the ground when installed, located to assist in guiding traffic, providing shade, or preserving existing trees.  At the Board’s discretion, some of these trees may be planted along the parking lot perimeter. (Amended June 12, 2017) 
3. 	
Additionally, one (1) tree at least three (3) inches in diameter 4.5 feet from the ground when installed shall be required at the ratio of one (1) tree per ten (10) parking spaces. Tree groupings of three (3) or more trees at least six (6) feet tall or two (2) inches in diameter as measured 4.5 feet from the ground when installed.  These trees may be located either along the parking lot perimeter or within the parking lot interior. Trees must be protected from vehicular damage and salt damage. . (Amended June 12, 2017) 

4. 	
For projects having parking lots of fifty (50) spaces or more, the following additional landscaping standards are required. 


a. 	
The interior of the parking lot shall include landscaping covering not less than ten (10) percent of the total area of the parking lot.  Such landscaping shall be in addition to any required buffer zone landscaping. 

b. 	
The primary landscaping material used in parking lots shall be trees which provide shade or which will provide shade at maturity.  Shrubs or other live planting material may be used to complement the tree landscape, and are encouraged. 

c. 	
At least sixty (60) percent of the required parking lot landscaping shall be either in continuous landscape strips or in large planting islands located entirely within the paved area of the parking lot, in order to break up the visual expansiveness of the lot. 

d. 	
At least sixty (60) percent of the planting areas shall be at least eight (8) feet wide. Berming, curbs, or other protection must be provided to prevent damage to trees and shrubs.  Provisions must be included to assure that rain can reach the root zone.  


5. 	
All parking lots of fifty (50) spaces or more which abut a public right of way or residential zone shall provide a landscaped buffer along at least seventy-five (75) percent of the length of the right-of-way or portion abutting the residential zone, at least eight (8) feet wide.  Berming is encouraged to provide screening of cars and paved areas. 

6. 	
Trees should be placed so as to avoid above-ground and below-ground utilities whenever possible. 

7. 	
All landscaping areas shall be properly maintained by the owner of the property or his agent. Shrubs, trees, or plantings that die shall be replaced within one (1) growing season. Landscaped areas shall be kept free of all debris, rubbish, weeds, and tall grasses (except ornamental grasses). 

8. 	
Landscaping requirements may be reduced to less than that stipulated herein if, in acting on site plan review, the Planning Board or Minor Site Plan Review Committee determines that a smaller amount would be adequate to comply with the purpose stated above, and the site is situated in such a manner that full compliance would provide little or no benefit to the public or the users of the site. 


June 12, 2017 
– Page 37 
APPENDIX C: 

LANDSCAPING 
A. 	It is the intent of the Planning Board that each site plan shall have attractive and well-maintained landscaping. The Board recognizes that industrial, commercial, and multi-family residential sites vary considerably, and, thus, a specific landscaping standard other than for parking areas has not been established.  The following guidelines are provided as indicators of Board concerns and requirements. 
1. 	
Landscaping and/or a solid visual barrier shall be used to screen loading areas and trash disposal areas and for other areas that are likely to generate noise, dust, or other potentially disruptive conditions. 

2. 	
Landscaping shall be used to form a buffer between non-residential and residential uses, and between single-family and multi-family projects, especially when multi-family units are different in height, form, and/or material than adjacent single-family units. 

3. 	
Landscaping shall be used to establish and/or maintain an attractive streetscape adjacent to roadways. 

4. 	
Landscaping shall be designed to allow for screening of vehicular headlights in parking areas. 

5. 	
Landscaping shall be utilized to minimize erosion and sedimentation. 

6. 	
Landscaping shall be maintained so that it continues to provide its designed function(s). 


B. 	All landscaping required by these provisions shall be kept in good condition and replaced as necessary to the standards herein, and be kept free of refuse and debris by the owner. 
C. 	A full landscaping and maintenance program prepared by an arborist, landscape architect, or other qualified individual or firm may be required by the Board.  Security to ensure proper installation may be required to extend up to twelve (12) months subsequent to final construction. 
D. 	The Board may require snow fencing or other protective devices to be installed prior to the start of site clearing in order to assure that mature trees or other important nature resources or landscaping features of the site are protected from vehicles, fill, storage of materials, or construction activities.

674:35 of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, and as amended, the Peterborough Planning Board adopts the following regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town of Peterborough, New Hampshire, hereinafter known as the Peterborough Subdivision Regulations. 

§237-2.  Purpose 
The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the orderly present and future development of the Town by promoting the public health, safety, convenience and welfare of its residents. These regulations apply to Planning Board review and approval or disapproval of all subdivisions as defined by RSA 672:14 and minor lot line adjustments or boundary agreements. They do not apply to voluntary mergers as defined by RSA 674:39-a, or boundary line agreements as defined in Article II. 

ARTICLE II – Definitions 
For the purposes of administration and enforcement, these rules shall apply: 
. 	
The word “shall” is always mandatory and not discretionary; the word “may” is permissive.

ARTICLE V – General Requirements for the Subdivision of Land 

§237-15.  Character of Land for Subdivision 
Land of such character that it cannot, in the judgment of the Board, be safely used for building development purposes because of exceptional danger to health or peril from fire, flood, poor drainage, excessive slope, or other hazardous conditions, shall not be platted for residential, commercial, or industrial subdivision, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to life or property, or aggravate the flood hazard. 

§237-16.  Premature Subdivision 
The Board may provide against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services which necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services. 

§237-17.  Preservation of Existing Features 
Wherever feasible, suitable steps shall be taken to preserve and protect significant existing features such as trees, scenic points, stone walls, rock outcroppings, water bodies, and historic landmarks. Where possible, the boundary line(s) should follow stone walls. 
June 13, 2016 – Page 9 

§237-18. Conservation Design 
All subdivisions shall be designed to take into consideration important natural, historic, and cultural features (for example noteworthy trees or tree groups, unusual geological formations, stone walls, etc.). To the greatest extent possible, the physical development shall be located on the lot so that such features will not be disturbed nor encroached upon.  

ARTICLE VI – Subdivision Design Standards 
§237-19.  Lots (Amended 6/13/16) 
A. 	Areas set aside for parks and playgrounds to be dedicated or reserved for the common use of all property owners shall be of reasonable size and character for neighborhood playgrounds or other recreational uses. 
B. 	Lots shall be laid out and graded to eliminate flood or stagnant water pools. No water shall be permitted to run across a street on the surface, but shall be directed into catch basins and pipes underground in a pipe of not less than 12 inches in diameter. 
C. 	Within all newly-created lots associated with a conventional subdivision, it must be possible to place a square box, whose sides are equal to the minimum lot width for the district, within the parcel. The minimum lot width shall be the same as the minimum frontage required for the district. 
D. 	All cut and filled slopes shall not be greater than 3:1 and shall be grades, loamed, seeded and mulched. 
E. 	Lots shall be numbered to coincide with the existing Parcel Identification numbering system. New lots shall be given a parcel number; thus, Lot R008-034-000 would be subdivided into R008-034-001, R008-034-002, etc. In cases where a lot at one time contained a letter (i.e., R8-34A), the letter was changed to a numbering system (e.g., R008-034-100), and therefore parcel R008-034-100 would be subdivided into R008-034-101, R008-034-102, etc. 

§237-20.  Reserve Strips 
Reserve strips of land that show an intent on the part of the subdivider to control access to land dedicated, or to be dedicated to, public use (such as a road) shall not be permitted. 

§237-21.  Fire Protection 
Applications for new subdivisions shall be required to address water supply needs for fire protection. The Fire Chief or his/her designee shall review all proposals to determine whether or not water supply should be addressed for that particular proposal; if so, the following requirements apply: 
A. The Fire Chief shall complete an inspection of the proposed site to evaluate the availability of existing water supply in the area. 
B. The Fire Chief shall implement all applicable provisions of the National Fire Prevention Association’s Standard on Water Supplies for Suburban and Rural Fire Fighting. 
June 13, 2016 – Page 10 
C. The Fire Chief shall determine the type, location and spacing of any water supply (such as fire ponds, cisterns, etc.) 
D. Following the inspection and evaluation, the Fire Chief will submit his findings in writing to the Planning Board. 
E. All proposed developments, whether 	including the provision of hydrants or other water supply facilities, shall be accessible to firefighting and other emergency equipment. 

§237-22.  Septic Systems and Water Supply 
A. In areas not currently served by public sewer systems, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to prove that the area of each lot is adequate to permit the installation and operation of an individual septic system. 
B. On new lots of less than five (5) acres, not less than two (2) test pits and at least one (1) percolation test shall be required within the 4,000 square-foot area designated for a leach field. 
C. In subdividing parcels with existing dwellings, the subdivider must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the existing septic system is in good working order and adequate for the existing structure. 
D. All new wells shall have a radius of seventy-five (75) feet that is located entirely on its lot. When that cannot be accomplished, the protective radius shall be maximized to the extent practicable. The 75­foot radius may extend over the property line(s) with written consent of the abutter(s). 

§237-23. Utilities 
A. Whenever necessary and practicable, all subdivisions will be serviced by town water and town sewer. All necessary water and sewer lines shall be installed to the required specifications of the Water and Sewer Department and shall include service lines running from the water and sewer mains to the property line to service each lot. 
B. All proposed utility easements shall be no less than ten (10) feet in width and shall have satisfactory access to existing or proposed public ways. Where practical, utilities should be placed underground. 

§237-24.  Stormwater Management and Erosion Control 
A. 	A stormwater management and erosion control plan is required when any one of the following conditions are proposed: 
1. 
A cumulative disturbed area exceeding one acre or more. 

2. 
Construction of a street or road. 

3. 
A subdivision of more than three building lots. 

4. 
The disturbance of critical areas (as defined in Appendix B). 


B. 	Standard agricultural and silvicultural practices are exempt from this regulation. 
C. 	All plans shall be developed in conformance with the Stormwater Management and Erosion Control Regulation contained in Appendix B and Stormwater Design Standards outlined in Appendix C. 
June 13, 2016 – Page 11 
D. 	It shall be the responsibility of all applicants to determine whether or not their project requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
E. 	A disturbed area of less than one acre may not need a plan, but must comply with accepted Best Management Practices. 

§237-25.  Monumentation 
A. Monuments constructed of concrete or stone at least 4 inches square and at least 30 inches long shall be set at all control corners. 
B. If the subdivision involves the construction of a roadway, all monumentation shall be in place before 50% of the surety held for the construction is released. If no road construction is involved, all monumentation must be in place prior to the signing of the plat by the Board Chairman. 
C. Pipes shall be set at all lot corners. Concrete or granite bounds shall be set at all points of curvature and all points of tangent for surveying purposes. 
D. Monuments shall be tied in to a public street intersection, a U.S.G.S. benchmark, or other recognized existing monument. 

§237-26.  Surveys 
A. All surveys shall be prepared according to the most up to date technical standards adopted by the NH Land Surveyors Association for Standard Property Surveys. 
B. In the case of applications that involve large acreages from which one building lot is being subdivided, the Board may waive the requirement for a complete boundary survey, when it is apparent that the remaining lot can meet existing frontage requirements and is suitable for building. 

§237-27.  Streets 
A. 	All new and reconstructed streets shall conform to the standards outlined in Appendix A. 
B. 	A Drainage Easement to be recorded in the Registry of Deeds is required for all new roads.  The Easement shall describes all culverts, drainage swales, detention basins, level spreaders, or other drainage facilities, and notes that these are conveyed to the Town along with the right of entry necessary to maintain them. 

§237-28.  Condominium Developments (Added 6/13/16) 
Condominium developments or conversions differentiate themselves from conventional subdivisions only in the form of ownership, and as such are permitted uses, subject to the zoning requirements for the district in which a development is proposed. In addition to the other provisions of these regulations, the following shall apply: 
A. 	For the purposes of site planning, the parcel on which the building(s) are located shall be treated as a single lot, but shall contain sufficient land area required for all proposed units in the district(s) in which the development is located. 
B. 	Condominium developments may be served by private roads, subject to the provisions set forth in Appendix A, Paragraph D. 
June 13, 2016 – Page 12 
C. 	The frontage from which the parcel is accessed need not be more than 50 feet to accommodate the right of way for the access road; internal roadways, however, must contain the total amount of frontage required for all proposed units in the zoning district(s) in which the development is located unless developed using the Open Space Residential Development approach (section 245-26). 
D. 	The setback requirements of the Zoning Ordinance apply to the parcel on which the building(s) are located.  Building placement and separation shall be consistent with the application of minimum lot width standards (the minimum frontage requirement) and setbacks that would have been required if a conventional subdivision were being developed, unless developed using the Open Space Residential Development approach (section 245-26), in which case minimum building separation shall be consistent with all applicable building, fire and life safety codes or 20 feet, whichever is greater. 
E. 	All common lands shall be subject to site plan review and compliance with site plan standards as they may apply. 
F. 	For condominium conversions of an existing building where no new development is proposed; no changes to the existing site are proposed, and no changes in use are proposed, said conversions shall be approvable administratively by the Community Development Director. 
1. 	
Prior to administrative approval the Community Development Director shall ensure appropriate documentation of the condominium conversion prior to recordation of the plan, including but not limited to the town assignment of parcel numbers, and review and approval of condominium documents by the Town Attorney.  

2. 	
A condominium conversion of an existing building that includes minor modification of the existing site or a change of use, either being consistent with the standards set forth in Planning Board’s Site Plan Regulations Section 233-3.B, may also be approved administratively by the Community Development Director. 


G. 	In addition to the submission requirements of Article IV, plans for condominium developments shall include the information required by RSA 356-B: 20. 
H. 	As a condition of approval, all condominium instruments shall be reviewed and approved by the Town Attorney prior to final signature of the plan by the Planning Board. 

ARTICLE VII – Developments Having Regional Impact 
A. 	All applications shall be reviewed for potential regional impacts. Upon such a finding, the Board shall furnish the regional planning commission(s) and the affected municipalities with copies of the minutes of the meeting at which the determination was made. The copies shall be sent by certified mail within 72 hours of the meeting. 
B. 	At least 14 days prior to the scheduled public hearing, the Board shall notify by certified mail the regional planning commission(s) and the affected municipalities of the date, time and place of the hearing, and of their right to appear as abutters to offer testimony concerning the proposal. 
ARTICLE VIII – Previously Approved Subdivisions 
If any land shown on a subdivision plat has been part of any previous subdivision approved, constructed, or created by conveyance no more than three (3) years prior to the new proposal, any such previous subdivision will be treated as part of the new proposal for purposes of analyzing its effect and applying all review criteria. 
June 13, 2016 – Page 13 

ARTICLE IX – Special Flood Hazard Areas 
A. The Planning Board shall review the proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 
U.S.C. 1334. 
B. The Board shall require that all subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include base flood elevation data. Sufficient evidence (construction drawings, grading and land treatment plans) shall be submitted so as to allow determination that: 
1. 	
all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 

2. 	
all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and 

3. 	
adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 



ARTICLE X – Performance Guarantee (Amended 6/13/16) 
A. As a condition of approval prior to issuance of any site development or building permits, the Board shall require the posting of a security in an amount sufficient to defray the costs of construction of streets, related amenities, and/or public utilities. The amount of the security shall be based on an estimate of costs provided by the applicant and reviewed by the Public Works Director or other designated professional.  All costs of such review shall be paid by the applicant.

June 13, 2016 – Page 17 
APPENDIX A: 
STREET STANDARDS 
A. PURPOSE AND INTENT 
The purpose of these standards is to provide design and construction guidance for both existing and new streets, whether public or private. These standards reflect the most up-to-date technical standards available at this time, as well as design standards that are intended to provide not only safe and efficient streets, but also streets that contribute to a sense of neighborhood and livability.  

B. 	GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS 
1. 	
GENERAL STREET PLAN. Approval of the general development street plan is required before construction of any phase of the plan. The street plan shall conform to References (1), (3), and (6) except as described at the end of this document. Any other variation shall be justified by engineering judgment and approved by the Board. 

2. 	
STREET LAYOUT. 


a. 	
General. All subdivisions shall have adequate provision for a safe and suitable access to a Class V or better road, or shall make provisions for the construction and dedication of a Class V or better road, to obtain safe and suitable access to the subdivision. Where the Board determines an existing access street to be substandard, it may require the upgrading of said street. Where traffic from a proposed subdivision will adversely impact a nearby street or intersection, provisions shall be made for the mitigation of said impacts. Proposed streets shall be of suitable location, width, grade, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, fire fighting, emergency equipment, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment. The arrangement and character of all streets in a subdivision shall conform to the Master Plan, and any and all other Town regulations, and shall compose a safe and convenient system in relation to other existing and planned streets, to topographic conditions, and to the proposed uses of land to be served by the street. Existing stonewalls shall be retained where possible or relocated and restored as required by the Board. 

b. 	
Access. No subdivision shall be approved unless the property to be subdivided shall have frontage on an existing Class V or better road, or a private road approved by the Planning Board. Each lot shall have a safe, independent and direct access. (Amended 6/13/16) 

c. 	
Arrangement. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at right angles as nearly as possible. No street shall intersect another street at less than 60 degrees. Streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing streets as much as possible. All streets shall be integrated with the existing and proposed street system where possible. The Applicant shall provide for a circular terminus at the end of all proposed roads for all phases and situations where through streets are not provided in the design. Where extension of existing roadways is proposed, the existing turnaround shall be removed in its entirety. 


3. 	DEAD-END (CUL-DE-SAC) STREETS. Except where near-future connections may be probable, dead-end streets shall be avoided whenever possible. Said streets shall not exceed 1,000 feet, and shall be provided with a turnaround having an inside road surface diameter of at least 90 feet.  No other dead-end streets are permitted off of a dead-end street. Consideration 
June 13, 2016 – Page 18 
shall always be given to potential future connections and, when a street cannot feasibly be connected to an existing street, every attempt shall be made to provide a loop road rather than a dead-end road. 
4. 	
The widths of blocks shall not be less than 200 feet nor longer than 1,200 feet. 

5. 	
STREET NAMES. All streets shall be named to comply with the provisions of the “Enhanced 911 System” (RSA 106-H: 2 and RSA 106-H: 10), and shall be subject to the approval of the Fire Department. 

6. 	
STREET SIGNS. The location and type of sign to be installed shall be in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). 

7. 	
STREET LIGHTS. Street lights shall be provided if required by the Board. 

8. 	
SAFETY. Safety is an important factor on all roadway improvements. On development roads it may not be possible or practical to obtain obstacle-free roadsides but every effort should be made to provide clear areas within the maintenance limits. The use of flatter slopes, the use of guardrail where necessary and the use of warnings signs are other safety factors to be considered. These areas are addressed in the publication Roadside Design Guide by AASHTO, 2002. 



C. CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS 
1. 	
GUARDRAILS. Guardrails shall be used in locations where the New Hampshire Department of Transportation’s typical warrant for guardrail is met and/or as required by the Board. Guardrails shall be metal beam on wood posts, meeting State specifications. All guardrail installation must end safely using a MELT-type terminal unit. FLEAT or ELT-type units may be permitted by the Road Department. 

2. 	
RIGHT-OF-WAY. The minimum width of right-of-way shall be 50 feet. A greater width may be required to construct roads and ditches of the widths as described in the attached “Geometric Cross Section Design.” The Board may require greater right-of-way width where, in its judgment, the width is warranted due to present or future demands. 

3. 	
HIGHWAY RIGHT-OF-WAY BOUNDS. Highway bounds, of a type approved by the Board, shall be installed at each point of curvature (PC), point of tangent (PT), and changes in property at all intersection of streets, at all points of change in direction and at any other points the Board may deem necessary to designate the street lines. 


a. 	
Type 

i. 	
Stone or Concrete Bounds shall be of concrete or stone, not less than thirty-six (36) inches in length, not less than four (4) inches square or five (5) inches in diameter, and marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron rod, or other durable material securely imbedded. 


ii. 	Iron Pipes shall be at least thirty-six (36) inches long and seven-eights (7/8) inch in diameter or square. 
June 13, 2016 – Page 19 
b. 	
Location 

i. 	
Bound Locations. The external boundaries, rights-of-way lines, block corners, etc. of a subdivision shall be monumented on the field by bounds. These bounds shall be placed not more than 1,400 feet apart in any straight line and at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point a curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line, said points to be not less than twenty (20) feet from the bank of any river or stream. 


ii. 	
Iron Pipe Locations.  The lines of all lots and any other points not monumented by bounds shall be monumented by iron pipes. Those iron pipes located along rivers and streams shall be located along the meander line. 

c. 	
Placement. Bounds shall be set flush with finished grade. No permanent bounds shall be set until all construction that would disturb or destroy the monuments is completed. All bounds shall be set under the direction of a registered professional engineer or a registered land surveyor. 


4. 	ALIGNMENT AND GRADES. Table 1 provides minimums for curves, grades, and other geometry. 
a. 	
Exception. Where, in the opinion of the Board, and where it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board by the Applicant that adherence to the maximum grade specified in Table 1 will cause local streets to be constructed in what the Board considers to be excessive cuts or fills, a waiver from the above specified maximum grade may be granted, provided: 

i. 	
The maximum allowable grade is eight percent (8%); 


ii. 	The maximum length of such grade, measured between vertical points of intersection (PVI) is five-hundred (500) feet; and 
iii. 	No other such slope greater than six percent (6%) occurs within five-hundred (500) feet measured along the centerline of the road from PVIs. 
5. 	
CLEARING AND GRUBBING. The entire area of each right-of-way shall be cleared and grubbed of all stumps, brush, roots, boulders, like materials and all trees not intended for preservation, and shall not be used for fill or buried on site. Clearing and grubbing shall conform to Section 201 of the State Specifications.  

6. 	
SUBGRADE PREPARATION. All loam, humus, soft clay, and other yielding material shall be removed from within the limits of the right-of-way to a depth of no less than twenty-four (24) inches below subgrade grade and/or to a depth that may be required by the Town Engineer. Ledge occurring anywhere in the full cross-section of the roadway must be cleared to a minimum depth of twenty-four (24) inches below the finished surface. Ledge occurring in pipe trenches must be cleared so as to have a gravel cushion of at least one (1) foot below and on both sides of the pipe. 

7. 	
STORM DRAINAGE. The proposed development shall provide for proper surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not adversely affect any neighboring properties or the public storm water system and will help reduce flooding, erosion, and sedimentation. The drainage system shall be designed so that the post-development runoff rate does not exceed the pre­development runoff rate. Surface water runoff shall be controlled and directed in a system of catch basins, pipes, swales, drainage ways, culverts, or channels to a natural watercourse or existing drainage facilities. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided an easement conforming to the lines of such watercourse. When a proposed drainage system will result in water encroaching on private 


June 13, 2016 – Page 20 
property on land outside a subdivision, appropriate drainage easements must be secured and indicated on the plan. Where the Town Engineer determines that the existing downstream, offsite drainage system is substandard, the Planning Board may require the Applicant to improve the drainage system. Whenever required, longitudinal storm drainage systems will be provided. Construction shall be in accordance with State Spec Sections 603, 604 and 605, and State Plans Standards DR-l, DR-2, DR-3, DR-4, and DR-S.

E. 	CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION 
Applicants shall ensure that roadways, drainage facilities, sidewalks, curbs and all other elements of the streets are constructed under the supervision of and with the approval of the Planning Board or its designated agent(s). Security for the project shall be provided in accordance with Article X of the Subdivision Regulations.   The Planning Board may require independent inspection of the project’s construction; if so, the following applies. 
1. 	
Temporary Improvement: 

The applicant shall build and pay for all temporary improvements required by the Planning Board and shall maintain same for a period specified by the Planning Board. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the local Board of Selectmen a separate suitable security for temporary facilities, which security shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 

2. 	
Costs of Improvements: 

All required improvements shall be made by the applicant at his expense without reimbursement by the municipality. 

3. 	
Failure to Complete Improvement: 

When security has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such security, the Board of Selectmen may thereupon declare the security to be in default and require that all public improvements be installed, regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the security is declared to be in default. 

4. 	
The Planning Board or its designated agent(s) shall provide the inspection of required improvements during the construction and certify their completion. 

5. 	
During the construction phase the developer or agent shall notify the Public Works Director at least two (2) business days in advance before starting the phases of construction as specified. 

6. 	
If, upon inspection, any of the required public improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the Planning Board construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a security, the applicant and the security company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications. Any costs incurred by the Town as a result of the inspection procedures shall be bone by the developer and failure to pay such costs may result in the calling of the security by the Town. 

7. 	
Occupancy Permits:  Pursuant to NH RSA 676:12, no occupancy permits will be issued until such time as all necessary public improvements have been deemed complete by the Planning Board or their designated agent. 


June 13, 2016 – Page 28 
8. Release or Reduction of Security 
a. Certificate of Satisfactory Completion:  
The Planning Board will not release, nor reduce security, until the Planning Board or their designated agent, has submitted a certificate, stating that all required improvements have been completed and until the applicant’s engineer or surveyor has certified to the Planning Board, or their designated agent, through submission of detailed “as built” survey plan of the subdivision, indicating locations, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the Planning Board, that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements and lot monuments is in accordance with the final plat and construction plans for the subdivision and that a title insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the Planning Board, as completed. 
b. Reduction of Security:  
Security may be reduced upon actual completion of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall security be reduced below twenty-five (25%) percent of the principal amount. 
c. Release of Security:  
Security may be released, in whole or in part, following notice from relevant agents that required improvements have been installed and completed in a satisfactory manner. Partial security release will be considered following receipt and approval of a revised estimate of the cost of the remaining improvements. The applicant shall submit to the Board “as-built” construction drawings prior to release of the security. 
d. Security: 
In no instance shall security be reduced below twenty-five (25)% of the principal amount. Upon completion of public improvements by the subdivider or owner, and approval by the Planning Board, the surety covering maintenance of the streets for a period of two years from completion and acceptance shall be required in an amount equal to twenty-five (25%) percent of the total cost of such improvements, or $10,000.00, whichever is greater. The maintenance of streets shall be defined as work required to correct defects in the construction if it becomes apparent to the Town within the two year time period.

APPENDIX B: 
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL REGULATION 
A. 	GENERAL 
The purpose of this regulation is to control runoff and soil erosion and sedimentation resulting from site construction and development of one acre or greater. Subdivision and site plans shall include plans for managing stormwater and controlling erosion and sedimentation as provided below. 
B. 	DEFINITIONS 
1. 	
Best Management Practice (BMP): A proven or accepted structural, non-structural, or vegetative measure the application of which reduces erosion, sediment, or peak storm discharge, or improves the quality of stormwater runoff. 

2. 	
Critical Areas: Disturbed areas of any size within 50 feet of a stream, bog, waterbody, or poorly or very poorly drained soils; disturbed areas exceeding 2,000 square feet in highly erodible soils; or, disturbed areas containing slope lengths exceeding 25 feet on slopes greater than 15 percent. 

3. 	
Development: Any construction or land construction or grading activities other than for 
agricultural and silvicultural practices. 


4. 	
Disturbed Area: An area where the natural vegetation has been removed exposing the underlying soil, or vegetation has been covered. 

5. 	
Erosion: The detachment and movement of soil or rock fragments by water, wind, ice, or gravity. 

6. 	
Highly Erodible Soils: Any soil with an erodibility class (K factor) greater than or equal to 0.43 in any layer as found in Table 3-1 of the "Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Urban and Developing Areas in New Hampshire." 

7. 	
Project Area: The area within the subdivision or site plan boundaries. 

8. 	
Sediment: Solid material, either mineral or organic, that is in suspension, is transported, or has been moved from its site of origin by erosion. 

9. 	
Stabilized: When the soil erosion rate approaches that of undisturbed soils. Soils which are disturbed will be considered protected when covered with a healthy, mature growth of grass or a good covering of hay or straw mulch (2 tons/acre). Mulch is only a temporary measure; ultimately, the site needs vegetation. 

10. 
Stormwater Runoff: The water from precipitation that is not absorbed, evaporated, or otherwise stored within the contributing drainage area. 

11. 
Stream: Areas of flowing water occurring for sufficient time to develop and maintain defined channels but may not flow during dry portions of the year. Includes but is not limited to all perennial and intermittent streams located on U.S. Geological Survey Maps. 


June 13, 2016 – Page 31

§ 238-6. Operational Standards 
In addition to the standards provided in RSA 155-E:4 and 4-a, the following shall apply to all excavations covered by these regulations: 
A. 	Access roads leading to the excavation site shall intersect existing streets and roads at locations that have been duly approved by state or local officials and in a manner that will not endanger the safety of highway users and local residents. 
B. 	Permit approval shall be conditioned on compliance by the applicant with street and highway regulations promulgated by federal, state, and local authorities. 
C. 	Natural vegetation adjacent to neighboring properties on which excavation is not intended shall be maintained for the purposes of erosion control, screening, noise reduction, and property value. The Planning Board shall have the authority to require additional screening where necessary. 
D. 	All temporary structures required during excavation operations shall be removed from the site within 30 days after such operations cease. 
E. 	All vehicles transporting excavated material shall utilize adequate covering and/or sideboards to prevent dust and spillage when loaded. 
F. 	Start up time for all machinery associated with a gravel or sand pit shall be no earlier than 
7:00 am and all machinery must be shut down by 6:00 pm.  Hours of operation other than those stipulated may be allowed if specifically authorized by the Planning Board, provided there is no detrimental impact on surrounding properties. 
G. 	Topsoil shall be stripped from the excavation area and stockpiled for use in subsequent reclamation of the site.  It shall be protected from erosion by seeding, covering, or some other acceptable method.  No topsoil shall be removed from the site without specific approval from the Planning Board. 
H. 	Appropriate erosion, sedimentation, air and water quality measures shall be integrated into the excavation process. Excavations shall comply with the erosion and sedimentation control provisions in the town's subdivision regulations. 
I. 	The applicable state statutes pertaining to forestry practice and timber harvesting shall apply to the removal of vegetative cover at excavation sites. 
J. 	Excavation operations shall be set back at least 50 feet from wetlands as defined in the Wetlands Protection District1 and it must be demonstrated that no sedimentation of the wetlands will occur as a result of the excavation. The Planning Board shall have the 
Editor's Note: See § 245-15 C(1). 
 Page 5 
authority to require greater wetlands setbacks in situations where it can be demonstrated that they will be required to protect the wetlands from degradation due to the proposed excavation operations. 
K. 	Excavation operations shall be performed in such a manner as to not cause substantial damage to any aquifer identified on the 1985 Aquifer Map prepared by Whitman & Howard, Inc. The Planning Board shall determine whether or not substantial damage to the aquifer will be incurred by considering the following criteria: 
(1) 
the excavation shall not detrimentally affect the quality of the groundwater contained in the aquifer by directly contributing to pollution or by increasing the long term susceptibility of the aquifer to potential pollutants; 

(2) 	
the excavation shall not cause a significant reduction in the long term volume of water contained in the aquifer or in the storage capacity of the aquifer. 


Furthermore, the Planning Board may require that the applicant provide data or reports prepared by a professional groundwater consultant which assess the potential aquifer damage caused by the proposed excavation project.  The Planning Board may require that the information submitted be reviewed by Whitman & Howard or another groundwater engineering firm at the applicant's expense. 
§ 238-7. Reclamation Standards 
In addition to the standards provided in RSA 155-E:5 and 5-a, the following shall apply to all excavations covered by these regulations: 
A. 	No slope in soil material shall be left steeper than 3:1 unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant that a steeper grade can be adequately vegetated and stabilized. 
B. 	Ground levels and grades shall be established as shown on the approved reclamation plan as soon as practical during site excavation, but not later than one year after excavation has been completed. 
C. 	Stockpiled topsoil shall be spread over the disturbed area to a depth sufficient to allow establishment and maintenance of vegetation.  Areas posing the most critical problems for re-vegetation shall be given first priority should available topsoil be limited.  The disturbed areas should be limed and fertilized, if necessary, and seeded with a grass or grass-legume mixture.   
D. 	If deemed necessary by the Planning Board, suitable trees or shrubs may be planted in order to provide screening and natural beauty and to aid in erosion control.  Such planted areas shall be protected from erosion during an appropriate establishment period by mulch and structural erosion control devices. 
 Page 6 
E. 	The responsible party shall not be released from its reclamation bond until the Planning Board receives certification from a registered professional engineer that all terms of the Excavation Plan and Reclamation Plan have been complied with.   
§ 238-8. Bonding 
The Planning Board shall establish the amount of the bond prior to the issuance of the excavation permit.  The bond shall be an amount sufficient for the reclamation of the site pursuant to RSA 155-E:4-a VII and to guarantee compliance with the permit, which may include re-landscaping areas visible from abutting properties if necessary, repairs to public roadways damaged as a result of the excavation operation traffic, and other items as may be required by the Planning Board. The reclamation portion of the bond shall be based on the acreage of the project or approved phases and the estimated per acre reclamation costs.  That portion of the bond shall be released when the reclamation has been completed and a final satisfactory site inspection has been conducted by the Planning Board or its designee. The remainder of the bond shall be released after a final satisfactory inspection by the Planning Board or its designee of any required road repairs and other bonded work. The applicant shall pay for any bond reviews by the Town Engineer or Town Counsel. 
§ 238-9. Enforcement 
In addition to the provisions of RSA 155-E:10, the Planning Board or its designee will conduct site inspections to verify permit compliance. These shall be done on an annual basis unless a more frequent schedule is necessary due to special characteristics of the excavation or reclamation plans. 
§ 238-10. Waivers 
In addition to the provisions of RSA 155-E:5-b, which addresses exceptions to the standards of RSA 155-E:4-a, 5, and 5-a, the applicant may request waivers to the submission requirements for the Excavation Plan or Reclamation Plan.  Any such request must be made in writing at the time of submitting the application, and shall include specifically which submission requirements the applicant requests the waivers for, the reasons why the waivers are being sought, and reasonable alternatives where appropriate. All waivers must be discussed at the public hearing, and the Planning Board's decision regarding waivers must be in writing and shall state specifically what submission requirements are being waived and what alternatives are accepted. 
§ 238-11. Separability 
If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, or provision of these regulations shall be adjudged invalid, such adjudication shall apply only to the section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, or provision adjudged, and the remainder of these regulations shall be deemed to be valid and effective.

November 14, 2005 – Page 1 
(B) 
The Town can and will offer assistance whenever possible, but it shall be the responsibility of property owners to comply with these regulations. 

(C) 
Driveways should follow the natural terrain, and cuts or fills should be minimized. 

(D) 
All driveways must be designed, constructed, and maintained so as to ensure that emergency vehicles, including ambulances and fire trucks, can ingress and egress easily during emergency events. 


§ 239-4. Owner Responsibility 
The owner of the property accessed by a driveway shall have continuing responsibility for the adequacy and maintenance of the driveway and any grades, culverts, retention basins and bridges pertaining to such access, whether or not the driveway is located within the public right-of-way.  If any driveway becomes a potential threat to the integrity of the highway or its surface, ditches, embankments, bridges, or other structures, or a hazard to the safety of the traveling public by reason of siltation, flooding, erosion, frost action, vegetative growth, improper grade, or the failure of any culvert, traffic control device, drainage structure, or other features; the Town may issue an order to the responsible party to repair or remove such hazardous conditions or take other actions as specified in RSA 236:13.  If no response within a reasonable time, the Town will take appropriate action; the costs of such action will be charged to the property owner.

Driveways with a slope of greater than nineteen (19) percent will not be permitted. 

(2) 	
Driveways shall normally not exceed twelve (12) percent. 

(3) 	
Where driveways intersect with a road or other driveway, whether public or not, the slope shall not exceed five (5) percent within thirty (30) feet of the intersection, so as to ensure that vehicles will have adequate distance to stop during icy conditions prior to reaching the intersection. Slopes greater than five (5) percent, up to ten (10) percent maximum are allowed provided the driveway is shorter than two hundred (200) feet and the first twenty-five (25) feet from the intersection are paved.

(20)
 feet. These regulations apply to both downward and upward slopes. 


2 This information is available from the Peterborough Fire Department. 
November 14, 2005 – Page 4 
N. 	Drainage & Erosion Control.       
(1) 	
Driveways which slope down from a road must be designed so as to avoid the conveyance of stormwater runoff from the road in a way that can cause flooding, erosion, or provide other hazard to the driveway itself or any structures on the property. 

(2) 	
No drainage can be discharged onto a public road and must be tied into any roadside drainage in a manner satisfactory to the Director of Public Works. 

(3) 	
During and after construction, the driveway must not cause erosion or sedimentation of drainage systems or surface waters. 

(4) 	
Cuts or fills greater than four (4) feet in depth shall be compacted to ninety-five (95) percent of standard proctor, as reviewed and approved by the Director of Public Works.  

(5) 	
For driveways one thousand (1,000) feet or more in length, or containing slopes of fifteen (15) percent or more, the issuance of a driveway permit will require a drainage plan by a New Hampshire licensed engineer, or other source acceptable to the Public Works Director, to ensure that stormwater and spring meltwater will not result in erosion, endanger the integrity of the driveway surface, or cause siltation of drainage systems or surface waters. 


O. 	No driveway entrance should be constructed within fifty (50) feet of an intersecting road, unless the applicant can demonstrate that there would be no safety hazards created. 
P. 	Driveways shall be located a minimum of ten (10) feet from side or rear property lines. 
Q. When two (2) driveway entrances on the same side of the road are within fifty (50) feet of each other, a common access may be required, for reasons of safety and topographical considerations.  
R. 	All-season safe sight distance in each direction is required, in accordance with standards recommended by NH DOT and/or American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).  
S. 	Any driveway crossing a wetland or body of water shall have all permits required by the NH Wetlands Board and/or the Peterborough Board of Adjustment prior to the driveway approval. 
T. 	There shall be no more than one primary access to a single parcel of land unless a need for multiple accesses can be demonstrated. 
U. 	Driveways shall intersect roadways at an angle of ninety (90) degrees, and must have a 25-foot radius. 
V. 	No structures (including buildings), permanent or portable signs, lights, displays, fences, walls, etc. shall be permitted on, over, or under the town road right-of-way. 
W. Driveways providing access to multi-unit residential, commercial, or industrial uses shall be designed to conform to good engineering practice using the most recent version of the NHDOT manual, Administrative Rules for the Permitting of Driveways and Other Accesses to the State Highway System as a guide. 
X. 	Shared Driveways. 
(1) 
If approved by the Planning Board and DPW, one driveway may serve up to three (3) residences. In such a case, the driveway must maintain a 50-foot right-of-way. 

(2) 
An independent inspection of the driveway is required, by an engineer approved by DPW and paid for by the applicant. The inspector will certify that these regulations are complied with. 


November 14, 2005 – Page 5 
(3) 
Before any application for a shared driveway is approved, the landowner(s) must submit a maintenance agreement and provide a deeded easement that clearly defines each property owner’s rights and responsibilities. 

(4) 
The house numbers for all residences are to be placed at the end of the shared driveway, and the individual house number is to be placed at the entrance to each private driveway according to Article IV, K. 


ARTICLE V -- Temporary Driveway Permits 
§ 239-6.  Permission 
Permission for temporary driveways for such activities as logging, utility maintenance and construction will be required from the Department of Public Works.  Temporary permits shall have a stipulated time limit.   
ARTICLE VI -- Procedures 
§ 239-7.  Application 
Prior to commencing work, the applicant will file an application with the Department of Public Works, on a form provided by that office.  A copy of the application will be forwarded to the Code Enforcement Officer. 
§ 239-8.  Inspection of Proposed Location 
A. 	Before DPW acts on the application, there will be an inspection of the site.  For any paved driveways or entrances, there shall be an inspection following the laying of the gravel base and prior to the final paving. 
B. 	A final inspection will be made to determine that all work has been satisfactorily completed in conformance with these regulations prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. 
C. 	The Public Works Department shall be responsible for the inspections of the driveway entrance (from the right-of-way to the property line); the Code Enforcement Officer shall be responsible for the inspection of the driveway from the property line to its end point.  The Fire Department is responsible for ensuring that the numbering of driveways providing access to a primary residence or building, and names of any shared driveways are compliant with these regulations. 
§ 239-9.  Notice 
The contractor shall give 24-hour notice to the Director of Public Works before starting construction. 
ARTICLE VII -- Administration and Enforcement 
§ 239-10.  Administration and Enforcement 
A. 	These regulations shall be administered by the Peterborough Planning Board.  The Planning Board, through the authority granted to it under RSA 236:13 (V) hereby delegates administrative duties regarding this regulation to the Department of Public Works and/or the Office of Community Development.  The enforcement of those regulations is by the Code Enforcement Officer. 
November 14, 2005 – Page 6 
B. 	In reviewing an application to construct a driveway, the Public Works Director shall apply accepted principles of traffic safety engineering.  In addition, the Director may, in the exercise of sound discretion, consider the factors including but not limited to the availability of town water, the existence of a sprinkler system, the quantity and quality of traffic, the existence of on-street parking, sight distance, adjacent land use, development of access away from arterial streets and onto side streets, anticipated development in the area, and speed limits. If after such review the Public Works Director approves the construction of a driveway, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a building permit. 
§ 239-11.  Modifications and Waivers 
The standards of these regulations may he modified or waived by the Director of DPW when specific circumstances surrounding a proposal, or a condition of the land, indicate that strict adherence to the standards would create a hardship for the landowner, and such modification will not be in conflict with the purpose and intent of these regulations.  If a waiver is requested, the Director of DPW will request an opinion from the Peterborough Fire Chief and the Office of Community Development to determine whether the request is reasonable. 
§ 239-12.  Bonds 
A bond of at least $1,000 is required for all driveways, including temporary driveways, in order to guarantee that there is no damage to the Town's right-of-way, and to correct any problems off-site that might have resulted from construction. 
§239-13.  Penalties 
A. 	Driveways constructed in violation of these regulations shall be corrected immediately upon notification by the Town, or the costs of removing or construction shall be fully borne by the property owner. 
B. 	Any person who violates any provision of this regulation shall be subject to fines and penalties as spelled out in RSA 676: 15 & 17.

2. Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses on a Commercial Farm
a. Purpose and Intent
i. Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses are intended to diversify a commercial farm’s offerings and increase opportunities to generate on-farm revenues by encouraging members of the public to visit, engage with and utilize the farm’s resource base. The purpose and benefits to the community of allowing these uses include: strengthening the economic viability of a farm; strengthening the public’s connection to and understanding of local food production; educating the public about the benefits of farming to the community; and strengthening the community’s local economy.
ii. As the additions of these types of Uses may have the potential to generate increased impacts that did not previously exist or could not have been anticipated by an existing residential neighbor to the farm, it is also in the community’s interest to ensure that any Uses permitted are appropriate for the sites they are on and that if permitted, the Uses and the sites they are on are designed to: ensure public safety; protect neighborhood character; avoid any substantial nuisance to the neighbors; and protect the quality of environmental resources. As a mechanism to help meet these goals, the Planning Board has the authority to establish reasonable limits to the uses and their size, scale, number of participants, frequency and hours of operation. The Planning Board also has the
§245-8 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-8
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 21 of 138
authority to establish such reasonable conditions as are necessary to carry out the spirit and intent of the ordinance.
iii. It is the intent of this ordinance that its application be limited to those properties where commercial farming is clearly intended to be the principal use of the property and that the combined scale of all proposed Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses are proportionately less significant than the overall scale of the combined Commercial Agriculture uses of the property. It is intended that these Uses are not, over time, permitted to become stand-alone uses or principal uses in relation to a commercial agriculture operation. To accomplish these goals, the Planning Board shall have latitude in exercising its discretion, when evaluating the individual circumstances of each applicant, proposal, and the characteristics of each site, to ensure that all approved proposals carry out the spirit and intent of the ordinance.
iv. It is the intent of this ordinance that applicants make all best efforts to meet with abutting landowners to discuss the proposal, identify concerns, and seek consensus regarding use designs (frequency, scale, scope, size, etc. of the proposed use) and site designs to address the identified concerns.
b. Conditional Uses that are permitted on a commercial farm subject to the criteria for Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses set forth below and in Article IX of the Peterborough Site Plan Review Regulations and subject to site plan review by the Planning Board as set forth in Chapter 233-3.A.4.
i. Provision of up to six guest bedrooms for overnight guests of the farm. Meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) may be provided for said overnight guests. A minimum of one (1) parking space shall be provided for each guest bedroom. [Amended 5/10/16]
ii. Farm to Table Café
iii. Event Venue for hosting events and activities with more than 30 participants, not including farm staff. Events and activities may include but are not limited to functions, ceremonies, receptions, meetings, day long events, farm-to-table meals, etc.
iv. Incidental Farm Related Activity or Amenity that has expanded to a point where it ceases to be incidental and has become a significant draw to the farm in its own right.
c. General criteria that apply to all Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses:
i. Subordinate to Commercial Agriculture as a Principal Use. Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses shall be ancillary and subordinate to a principal use of commercial agriculture. Transition or expansion of an Agricultural Business Enterprise use into a principal commercial use may not be permitted;
ii. Compatibility. The proposed Use and site designs are compatible with the general dimensional, design, and use characteristics of the neighborhood, the public or private roads used to access the site, and the surrounding area; the property is otherwise reasonably well suited for the proposed use;
iii. Aesthetic Character. The proposed Use will not adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the streetscape or neighborhood;
iv. Nuisances. The proposed Use and site design will not result in any substantial adverse impacts including but not limited to noise, light trespass, odors, or smoke; or place any undue burden on any abutter;
v. Resources. The proposed Use will not have a significantly adverse impact upon natural, scenic, historic, or cultural resources and can be designed with sensitivity to environmental constraints; and
§245-8 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-8
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 22 of 138
vi. Loss of Agricultural Capacity of Farmland. The proposed Use and site shall be designed to protect the future production capacity of farmland and avoid conversion of existing productive farmland or underutilized land with important agricultural soils, to uses that would eliminate future production potential of the farmland;
d. Factors to Consider in evaluating compliance with general criteria.
i. Is Commercial Agriculture the principal use of the property or will it be so in the reasonably near future? In making such a determination, consideration may be given to:
1. The extent to which the land and structures are currently engaged in productive Commercial Agriculture use or are to be reclaimed for future productive Commercial Agriculture use within a reasonable timeframe, as compared to other existing or proposed uses of the property;
2. Evidence of investment (human and financial) made in maintaining and growing the Commercial Agriculture business including but not limited to building soils, reclaiming or planting fields or orchards, building or restoring barns, or acquiring and maintaining related equipment and facilities;
3. Evidence of markets and customers served by the operation;
4. Volume of annual revenues generated or expected to be generated in the future from Commercial Agriculture as compared to other revenue sources and uses of the property.
5. For the purpose of this ordinance, small or beginning farms may be considered commercial farms if they can demonstrate to the Planning Board’s satisfaction that they have a sound plan for growing a viable commercial agriculture operation as a principal use of a property within a reasonable timeframe.
ii. Will the proposed Agricultural Business Enterprise Uses be proportionally less significant than the overall scale of the combined Commercial Agriculture Use? In making such a determination, consideration may be given to:
1. The extent to which the proposed Use(s) occupy or utilize less space within structures or land areas than the principal use.
2. The expected investment of resources (human and financial) in the Uses on an annual basis as compared to actual investment of resources in the Commercial Agricultural Operation.
3. The expected revenue generated by the proposed Use(s) in an average year compared to the annual revenues generated by the Commercial Agricultural Operation.
iii. To what extend do the site characteristics, the neighborhood characteristics, and the site and use design promote compatibility between the proposed uses and abutting uses, avoid or mitigate substantial nuisances to abutting properties, and maintain or enhance the rural character of the property and the neighborhood.? In making such a determination, consideration may be given to:
1. Road width, construction, and type (dead-end roads, through roads, State roads ), existing traffic volumes, and proposed traffic volumes
2. Neighborhood density (around site and along access roads to site);
3. Proximity of abutting residential dwellings to the proposed activities/uses;
4. Existing site characteristics (topography, natural vegetation, proximity to surface water/wetlands, etc.) and the likelihood that the natural site characteristics will adequately buffer or mitigate potential impacts;
§245-8 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-8
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 23 of 138
5. Site design and how uses are placed on the site to avoid adverse impacts and how the site is proposed to be configured or modified to mitigate and prevent adverse impacts;
6. The nature and design of the proposed activities and uses, including their proposed scale, size, frequency, and operating hours, and the likelihood that they produce unreasonable impacts or nuisances given the above factors;
7. Overall Rural Character and how proposed use will impact aesthetic quality of the neighborhood; and
8. Proximity of proposed uses to significant or sensitive natural, historic, scenic or cultural resources and the extent to which the site and uses are designed to prevent, avoid, or mitigate adverse impacts to these resources.
iv. To what extent does the site design avoid impact to the production capacity of farmland; In making such a determination, consideration may be given to:
1. Relationship and proximity of underutilized farmland that may be impacted to existing productive farmland;
2. Quality and continuity of the farmland soils and the likelihood that they could reasonably be used for agricultural production; and
3. Economics of making necessary improvements to make unused farmland soils productive.
e. Burden of Persuasion. The applicant shall bear the burden of persuasion, through the introduction of sufficient evidence as may be required by this Section or by the Planning Board in its reasonable discretion that the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with this section and will satisfy the specific requirements for the uses or standards contained in this Section.
f. Conditions of Approval. The Planning Board may impose such conditions as it finds reasonably appropriate and necessary to meet the spirit and intent of this ordinance, or which would otherwise allow the criteria set forth in Article IX of the Site Plan Regulations to be satisfied. When considering conditions, the Planning Board shall take care to avoid the application of site design requirements and conditions that are inappropriate for or degrade the rural character of the setting. Conditions of approval shall be stated in writing in the issuance of a permit.
g. Waivers and Modifications
The Planning Board may waive or modify provisions of this section and the following sections of the Zoning Ordinance and Site Plan Regulations if, in the judgment of the Board, specific circumstances relative to the proposal and the site indicate that a waiver or modification of the provisions will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance and the Planning Board Regulations:

BUSINESS DISTRICTS
§ 245-10. Downtown Commercial District
§ 245-10.1. Commercial District
§ 245-10.2. Business/Industrial District
A. Overall Purpose & Intent
PURPOSE: The purpose of the three Business Districts is to: allow a mixture of complimentary land uses that will create opportunities for commercial and industrial use in a way that is balanced and promotes economic vitality in Peterborough; encourage diversity in the tax base; and provide appropriate locations for a broad range of commercial/industrial activities within existing commercial districts. It is understood that there may be more than one principal use allowed on one lot or in one building. In these Business Districts, buildings may be erected, placed, altered or used and land may be used only for the purposes as stated below.
INTENT: The Peterborough Master Plan provides the following guidance for the development of these districts:
? Peterborough benefits from being the center that provides services and facilities to the surrounding region.
? A diverse, vibrant economy is essential in order to keep the town we want.
? Economic development can be the vehicle for providing resources and energy for positive actions to preserve both natural and cultural resources.
? The community desires businesses that allow residents to do a majority of their shopping locally.
B. District Purpose Statements
The purpose of the Downtown Commercial District is to provide for a mix of mutually supporting uses, both business and residential, serving local, regional, and visitor markets within a pedestrian-oriented environment and a storefront character, doing so compatibly with the existing community character. A defining characteristic of this District is that it is pedestrian-oriented.
The purpose of the Commercial District is to provide opportunity outside of the Downtown to locate business/commerce in the Town of Peterborough. Since all of the individual nodes of this District are located along state highways, a defining characteristic of this District is that many of the permitted uses are automobile-dependent, although opportunity is also created for pedestrian-intense uses.
The purpose of the Business/Industrial District is to increase commercial opportunities while protecting the aesthetic and visual character of the highway corridor. A defining characteristic of this District is that it is expected to serve an area larger than the Town.

E. Other requirements.
1. Access to any commerce park shall be from a State numbered highway or other major arterial road.
2. No driveways from individual lots within the commerce park may access directly to a State numbered highway or major arterial road unless the lot was a lot of record prior to the adoption of this section §245-10.1 and meeting this driveway access requirement would render the lot to be without economic value.

a. Up to twenty percent (20%) of the land within the District may be serviced by New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services approved septic systems.
b. Because the Commerce Park District allows a variety of uses, each use connecting to a septic system must be reviewed by NHDES and the Peterborough Public Works Director prior to the issuance of building permits, prior to occupancy by the new use. This review shall be to assure that the septic system being connected to is appropriate for the types and volumes of waste being discharged.
c. Any septic system within this district must be inspected at the time of installation and subsequently every twenty-four (24) months, or other frequency approved by the Peterborough Public Works Director; to certify that the septic system is properly functioning and property maintained.

2. If the applicant, upon appeal, requests a variance as authorized by RSA 674:33, I(b), the applicant shall have the burden of showing, in addition to the usual variance standards under state law:
a. That the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense.
b. That, if the requested variance is for an activity within a designated regulatory floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result.
c. That the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
3. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.) for one hundred dollars ($100.) of insurance coverage and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
4. The community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including its justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to FEMA's Federal Insurance Administrator.

§ 245-15.1. Bulk Fuel Storage District
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish rules and procedures for bulk fuel storage facilities within the Town of Peterborough. These regulations do not apply to gas stations unless they also conduct a separate bulk fuel storage/distribution business at the site. All existing bulk fuel storage facilities are exempt from these regulations, although any future modification involving the relocation of or installation of additional tanks must conform to these regulations.
B. Location. The Bulk Fuel Storage District is an overlay Zoning District that shall include parcel numbered U016-023-000.
C. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning herein.
BULK FUEL STORAGE -- Any location where there are ten thousand (10,000) gallons or more of fuel intended for storage, transfer, or distribution.
D. General Provisions.
1. For existing Bulk Fuel Storage facilities, any modification or expansion of the fuel storage facilities must be approved under the provisions of this regulation.
2. Bulk Fuel Storage facilities are permitted in the Bulk Fuel Storage District only by obtaining a Special Permit granted by the Planning Board. The use shall meet the following minimum requirements:
a. New Bulk Fuel Storage facilities shall not be allowed within the Shoreland Conservation Zone or within 50 feet of a wetland.
b. For existing Bulk Fuel Storage facilities, modification of facilities already existing within the Shoreland Conservation or Wetland zones may be allowed within the Shoreland Conservation or Wetland zones, so long as it involves no increase in the amount of fuel stored within those zones if in the judgment of the Planning Board the modifications improve safety and reduce risk to the environment and to the public.
c. The use shall conform to all other applicable ordinances of the Town.
E. Special Permit Process.
1. Anyone seeking to modify an existing Bulk Fuel Storage Facility or construct a new one must obtain a Special Permit under the provisions of this section as well as Site Plan Approval, both issued by the Peterborough Planning Board. Applicants are encouraged to contact Office of Community Development (OCD) staff early in the planning process, prior to submitting a formal application. OCD shall prepare an application form for this Bulk Fuel Storage Special Permit process. Once an application is received, OCD shall within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a complete application submit a written report to the Planning Board which includes, at a minimum:
a. A description of the project including its size, the type(s) of fuel to be stored, how fuel will be transported to and from the site, hours of operation, spill prevention features, appearance of the facility including height, size, shape, location, and color of tanks, structures, and equipment, as well as lighting and emergency response plans.
b. Comments from the Fire Chief, Police Chief, and Public Works Director.

§ 245-15.3 Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zone I [Adopted 5/13/14]
A. Purpose and Intent: The purpose of this section is to allow for the infilling of lots and additional residential housing in close proximity to the Downtown Area in sections of town where there are established subdivided neighborhoods. This approach to development is in furtherance of Vision Statements and Goals & Objectives of the Peterborough Master Plan. Advantages of infill development as described in the Master Plan include:
1. creating housing opportunities that reflect changing household demographics (such as retirees, single person households);
2. discouraging extensive development in rural parts of town;
3. locating density within close proximity to police, fire, and emergency services;
4. allowing residents to become less auto dependent;
5. making more efficient use of the Town’s infrastructure including water & sewer services; and
6. creating opportunity for smaller, more energy efficient, and thus more affordable, housing.
B. Authority and Administration: This section is adopted in accordance with RSA 674:21, Innovative Land Use Controls and RSA 675: 1, II. Pursuant to RSA 674:21, II the Planning Board is hereby authorized to grant Conditional Use Permits for applications for subdivisions and new residential dwelling units, as provided in this section. In the granting of any such Permit, the Board may attach reasonable conditions, or waive or modify any of the requirements of this section if specific circumstances relative to the proposal indicate that the waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of this ordinance.
C. Applicability: The following provisions apply to all lots in the Family and General Residence Districts surrounding the Downtown Commercial District within the area designated on the zoning map as the “Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zone I”. The dimensional and use standards contained in Paragraph E below shall supersede the underlying zoning districts upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit; however all other relevant provisions of the zoning ordinance shall still apply.
D. Permitted Uses: Uses permitted in the underlying Family District and General Residence District shall continue to be permitted in those respective districts.
E. Minimum Requirements are as follows:
1. Water & Sewer: In order to be eligible for subdivision under this ordinance, lots must either be already served by Town water and sewer or are able to connect to existing service. Any proposed new dwellings must be approved by the DPW Director for connection to Town water and sewer.\
2. Reuse of Existing Buildings: The demolition of existing habitable dwellings in order to subdivide a lot or create additional dwelling units on an existing lot is strongly discouraged, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that the structure is in such a state of disrepair that rehabilitation is cost-prohibitive or that the existing structure is out of character with the architectural scale and style of adjacent and nearby residential structures.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 61 of 138
3. Lot and Yard Standards. The following minimum lot and yard standards apply to subdivisions or the addition of dwelling units that do not involve subdivision. If a subdivision is proposed, each lot must meet these minimum standards. If no subdivision is proposed, the existing lot must meet these minimum standards before any additional dwelling units could be approved.
Family District General Residence District
a. Frontage: 75 feet 50 feet
b. Lot Size:
i. Single Family: 10,000 square feet 5,000 square feet
ii. Two-Family: 10,000 square feet 7,500 square feet
iii. Multi-Family: NA 5,000 square feet plus 2,500 square feet for each unit
4. Setback Requirements: The front building setbacks shall be determined by taking the average of existing developed residential lots located on either side of the project parcel, on the same side of the street, based on the most recent Town mapping, as measured along the adjacent street frontage from the lot proposed for development. In no instance shall the front setback be less than fifteen (15) feet nor greater than fifty (50) feet. Minimum side and rear setback requirements shall not be less than ten (10) feet, and may be greater if the Planning Board finds that unusual characteristics exist and a greater setback would be more in keeping with character of the neighborhood and streetscape.
5. Building Design: The height, scale and massing of the building, the sizing, orientation and spacing of doors and windows, and the shape and orientation of the rooflines shall reflect other existing residences within 300 feet of the property in both directions on both sides of the street, as measured along the adjacent street frontage from the lot proposed for development. The primary entrance to new buildings shall be oriented to the street, unless the prevailing orientation of the residences within the 300-foot distance is other than toward the street. The Planning Board shall utilize the “Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zone ISite and Building Design Guidelines” that are appended to this section in making a determination of neighborhood compatibility, which shall be required as part of the granting of a Conditional Use Permit.
6. Lot Coverage: In the Family District no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the lot shall be covered with impervious materials. In the General Residence District no more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the lot shall be covered with impervious materials. Driveways are discounted from this calculation.
7. Parking & Driveways:
a. Driveways and parking areas shall not be less than five (5) feet from the side or rear property lines and may be greater if the Planning Board finds that a greater setback is necessary to avoid negative impacts to neighbors. Parking spaces for the existing and proposed units shall be shown on plans. Parking for two cars may be in a tandem configuration. Parking spaces or garages must be located at the rear of the lot unless the applicant can demonstrate that it is either not reasonable or feasible to create a parking area in the rear. If a garage cannot be located in the rear of the lot, it must be located behind the front building line of the house.
b. Driveways and parking areas between lots are encouraged; if a driveway is shared, the setback stated above does not apply. Shared parking must provide the total number of spaces required by the zoning ordinance for the number of units to be created. In such a case, a signed and notarized Cross-Access Agreement between the applicable property owners must be filed with the Registry of Deeds, with a copy provided to the Code Enforcement Officer at the time of building permit application.

F. Procedure:
1. The owner/developer of a proposed project under this overlay zoning ordinance shall submit an application to the Planning Board for a Conditional Use Permit, and subdivision plan where applicable. Said application shall include sufficient site and building design detail to enable the Planning Board to make a determination of neighborhood compatibility for the proposed design.
2. The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing on the proposed development project to which all property owners within 300 feet in each direction on both sides of the street of the proposed new residence shall be provided notice.
3. The Planning Board shall make a decision as to whether the conditions for granting a Conditional Use Permit have been satisfied. In making their decision, the Planning Board may approve, modify or deny an application. If the application is denied, the Planning Board shall provide suggestions as to how the proposal could be modified to make it compatible with the existing neighborhood character.

SITE AND BUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES
NOTE: These guidelines serve as a reference for the Planning Board and the Code Enforcement Officer in the processing of any applications under the Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zone I provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, §245-15.3.
Site and Building Design Guidelines
The following Design Guidelines are intended to be used by the Planning Board and the public to ensure that new homes in the Traditional Neighborhood Overlay District I respond to existing neighborhood patterns that residents value. The guidelines focus on basic building and site relationships and are intended to foster pedestrian-oriented streetscapes and harmony between new and existing homes. There is a great deal of diversity of architectural styles and site relationships in Peterborough neighborhoods and therefore there many options for new building design. These guidelines are intended to articulate the primary considerations to ensure new homes are sensitive to neighborhood context while also promoting design creativity.
§245-15.3 Appendices TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 64 of 138
Front Setbacks
New homes should continue prevailing building setback patterns in order to reinforce the rhythm and character of the streetscape environment. There is quite a bit of variation along residential streets in Peterborough and appropriate setbacks may vary from lot-to-lot depending on the street’s context. Setbacks should generally be drawn from neighboring houses on the same side of the street and reinforce the prevailing neighborhood fabric, neither pulling back too far from the street nor setting the home too close to the street. When spaces between the house and the street become too large, the sense of enclosure along the street is lost and it becomes more difficult to provide rear parking or backyard space. Buildings set closer to the street than the prevailing residential patterns disrupt the rhythm and order of the streetscape and appear intrusive.
§245-15.3 Appendices TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 65 of 138
Building Orientation and Location of Parking
Buildings should orient to and face the street. Along street frontages orient windows, the primary pedestrian entry and other building façade elements toward the street. Buildings should not turn their backs or sides to the street.
Garages and parking areas should be located to the rear of the lot, ideally front facing garage doors would be set a minimum of 20-feet behind the front façade of the house and the driveway should be limited to one lane between the street and the front façade. If it is not possible to set the garage back 20 feet, the Planning Board may reduce the setback taking into consideration the site conditions and neighborhood context. Garages may be placed beneath the main floor of the house, and turned to the side to reduce the negative visual impact of garage doors facing the street. Shared driveways are encouraged, where appropriate.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 66 of 138
Building Height and Massing
The front elevation of a new home should be similar in terms of height and width to other houses along the street. Buildings should be consistent with the orientation of the main mass of the building and its relationship to the street. In many traditional New England neighborhoods, the main building mass was oriented perpendicular to the street creating narrow and deep lot and house patterns. This building pattern often resulted in the row of repeating gables facing the street that is emblematic of nineteenth century New England townscapes.

Architectural Features
Some neighborhoods have clear recurring architectural features (including porches or other entry features, fenestration patterns, roof forms, building details, materials, etc.) that are valued by the community as key aspects of a neighborhood’s character. New houses should incorporate prevalent neighborhood architectural features such as porches, gable roofs, dormers, board siding into new buildings when appropriate.
Above: Many neighborhoods in Peterborough have a strong sense of place based on a variety of recurring architectural features including gable roofs, dormers, porches and entry features.

§245-24.3 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-24.3
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 87 of 138
b. Reconstruction of Existing Structures. Towers in existence prior to the adoption of these regulations may be reconstructed in kind without Site Plan Review or a Special Permit, so long as there is no increase in height, so long as the reconstruction will not result in increased visual or environmental impact, and so long as there is no expansion or substantial modification of ancillary facilities or driveways. If additional ancillary facilities are needed or if other site modifications are required, the project shall require Site Plan approval from the Planning Board. If reconstruction will result in an increase in height or a significant modification of the appearance or type of tower, then a special permit shall be required.
c. Street-side Utility Poles. Street-side utility poles are those poles which are located in or within twenty-five (25) feet of a road right-of-way. The placement of new wireless telecommunication facilities on existing street-side utility poles will require a special permit. The Town encourages the re-location of utility poles or placement of underground utilities and discourages the placement of additional wireless telecommunication devices upon such poles. Antennas that can be incorporated into existing freestanding streetlights shall only require site plan review.
d. Construction of New Towers. The construction of new towers for telecommunication facilities is discouraged except where and when no reasonable alternative exists, and such projects shall require a Special Permit from the Planning Board, and must comply with the provisions of these regulations. A separate Site Plan Review will not be required when a Special Permit is required. However, these regulations incorporate the Peterborough Site Plan Review Performance Standards, to the degree those standards do not conflict with the provisions of these regulations, in which case these regulations shall prevail.
e. Regional Notification. In accordance with the regional notification requirements of RSA 12-K:7, the applicant shall pay for notification to adjacent communities when the construction of a new tower or an increase in height of an existing tower. For the purposes of these regulations it shall be assumed that the adjacent towns of Dublin, Greenfield, Hancock, Jaffrey, Sharon, and Temple could be visually affected, and that unless specifically determined by the Peterborough Planning Board to not be necessary, each of those towns will be notified by the Office of Community Development, at the applicant’s expense.
E. Dimensional Requirements.
1. Height. It is the intent of these regulations that wireless communication facilities shall not have an urbanizing effect upon the rural visual character of Peterborough. For that reason, the maximum height of new wireless communication facilities shall not exceed twenty (20) feet above the average surrounding tree canopy height as measured within a two hundred (200) feet radius of the proposed facility location. Nor shall the height exceed ninety (90) feet. The Planning Board shall have the authority to grant exceptions to the height limitations. The Board may require a lower height than the maximum allowed if, in its judgment, such lower height is necessary at the proposed location to protect the rural and visual character of adjacent properties and the community as a whole. The Board may also, on a case-by- case basis, allow an increase in height of wireless telecommunication facilities to an upper limit of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, with the following restrictions:
a. No telecommunication tower or facility shall exceed ninety (90) feet unless it is surrounded by mature trees that will be protected by easement or other means to assure dense natural screening.
b. The Board must make written findings of fact as to why the increase in height is in the best interest of the community and why the increased height will not harm the visual quality and character of adjacent properties and the community as a whole. It is the presumption of this ordinance that heights greater than ninety (90) feet tend to be a disruptive visual element in the Peterborough landscape, and that the Board will not normally allow a greater height.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 88 of 138
2. Height on Existing Structures. The height of existing structures may, by special permit from the Planning Board, be increased to accommodate wireless communication facilities if the facility is camouflaged, so long as the facility is, in the judgment of the Planning Board, in scale and proportion to the existing structure.
3. Antenna Types. Any antenna array placed upon an existing or proposed ground mount, utility pole, or transmission line mount shall have a diameter of no more than four (4) feet, exclusive of the diameter of the mount. A larger diameter antenna array may be permitted after a finding by the Planning Board that the visual impacts of a larger antenna array are negligible.
4. Setback. All wireless communication facility buildings shall meet the setback requirements of the underlying zone in which they are to be located.
5. Safety Zone. All wireless communication facilities towers shall have a safety zone sufficient, in the judgment of the Board, to protect the public and adjacent properties from either a structural collapse or from wind-blown ice. Unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary, the base of any telecommunication facility shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to its height. The Board may require a greater setback distance to address wind-blown ice.
F. Design Standards.
1. Engineering Certification. Wireless communication facilities will require plans certified by a New Hampshire licensed structural engineer. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, the Office of Community Development shall be provided with a written certification from a qualified New Hampshire licensed engineer, at the expense of the applicant, that the facilities have been constructed and installed in accordance with the approved plans and that the facility is operating in compliance with its Federal license.
2. Visual Appearance.
a. All wireless communication facilities shall be camouflaged to the greatest extent possible, using compatible building materials and colors, screening, camouflage techniques, with native species landscaping and/or placement within trees. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
b. Every wireless communication facility must blend into its surroundings as much as possible. Each application for wireless communication facilities must demonstrate that there will be minimal visual impact. A photo-realistic simulation and an on-site balloon test shall normally be required for all new towers and may be required for other new wireless communication facilities.
c. The color of equipment sheds should blend in with their surroundings, to be determined by the Board on a case-by-case basis. Landscaping or screening shall normally be required for equipment sheds and may be required for other components of a wireless communication facility.
d. All ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by a buffer of dense tree growth that extends continuously for a minimum distance of one hundred and fifty (150) feet from the mount, security barrier, or designated clear area for access to equipment, whichever is greatest, and screens views of the facility in all directions. These trees must be existing on the subject property, planted on site, or be within a landscape easement on an adjoining site. The Planning Board shall have the authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on site conditions. The one hundred and fifty (150) feet for vegetative buffer area shall be protected by a landscape easement or be within the area of the carrier’s lease. The easement or lease shall specify that the trees within the buffer shall not be removed or topped, unless the trees are dead or dying and present a hazard to persons or property.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 89 of 138
e. Communication towers shall normally not be approved in open fields, even if disguised as flag poles. When possible, wireless communication facilities should be placed within existing buildings or structures so as to hide or camouflage them. In rural portions of the town where existing structures may not exist for camouflaging, the placement of towers and associated facilities within permanently wooded areas is encouraged so that native species of trees can provide natural camouflage. The Town shall require some form of easement or other means of assuring that an adequate buffer of trees is maintained until the tower is removed. Facilities shall not be located within two hundred (200) feet of a crest, ridgeline, or summit, except that the Planning Board may allow siting on a minor crest or ridgeline if the Board concludes that such siting will have minimal off-site visual impact and will otherwise best meet the purposes of this ordinance.
f. Any telecommunications facility located on or within an historic structure shall not alter the character-defining features, distinctive construction methods, or original historic materials of building. Any alterations made to accommodate wireless communication facilities within or on an historic structure must be fully reversible unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.
3. Noise. Wireless communication facilities must comply with the noise standards of the Peterborough Zoning Ordinance.
4. Equipment Shelters. Whenever possible, equipment shall be located within existing structures or in underground vaults. When required to be above ground, equipment shelters shall be of materials and colors that blend into the surrounding landscape, and shall be screened, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board, behind an effective year-round buffer equal to the height of the proposed building.
5. Lighting. Wireless communication towers and antennas shall not be lighted, except as specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration. Lighting of equipment structures or other associated facilities is discouraged and shall not be visible beyond the property line. All utility wiring to the facility shall be underground, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.
6. Signage. Signage shall be limited to an identification of the property and owner and warning of any dangers. All signage must comply with the Town’s sign regulations.
7. Security Fencing. Unless otherwise specified by the Planning Board, security fencing shall be provided to prevent access, except by authorized personnel. This will normally require a locked wall, fence, or berm that completely seals off the facility from unauthorized entry or trespass. The appearance of this fencing should blend into the existing setting of the site. Silver-colored galvanized fencing will normally not be accepted.
8. Emissions.
a. All wireless communication facilities must comply with the Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) standards of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Town may require periodic inspections by a qualified engineer, at the applicant’s expense, to assure compliance with FCC guidelines.
b. No antenna will be permitted in a location where it will interfere with existing transmittal or reception of radio, television, audio, video, electronic, microwave, or other signals. The applicant must specifically demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Town that the proposed emissions will not interfere with Town of Peterborough’s communications (Police, Fire, and Public Works).

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 90 of 138
G. Maintenance and Inspections.
1. All facilities must be maintained in good repair and must at all times comply with all FCC regulations. To assure compliance with these regulations, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the applicant shall provide the Town with written certification, based upon a documented field inspection, that the facilities are fully compliant with the plan approved by the Town, that the facilities are structurally sound, and that they are operating in compliance with FCC regulations, including those dealing with emissions.
2. The applicant shall continue to provide such inspection-based certification at least every five years or at other shorter intervals, as specified by the Planning Board at the time of approval. The Board may require a special inspection of wireless communication facilities after major storm events such as hurricanes or ice storms.
H. Monitoring. A condition of the issuance of a building permit for a wireless communication facility shall be that representatives of the Town of Peterborough may enter the site of such facility to obtain Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) measurements, noise measurements, and to otherwise determine compliance. The Town will provide at least seven (7) days written notice of such inspection and shall provide the owner/applicant the opportunity to be present during such inspection.
I. Removal of Facilities. The owner of a wireless communication facility shall remove antennas, mounts, equipment shelters, security barriers, and other facilities from the site within one hundred and twenty (120) days of discontinuance or abandonment. The site must be left in a stable, non-eroding, litter-free, and attractive condition. To assure that such removal takes place, a performance guarantee shall be provided in a form that is acceptable to the Planning Board, equal to the estimated cost of removal of the approved facilities. The performance guarantee can be used by the owner of the facility, with prior written approval of the Town, to pay removal costs. Any remaining funds will be returned to the owner upon the successful removal of discontinued or abandoned facilities. If the owner fails to remove the facilities or to properly restore the site, the Town may utilize these funds to pay for such removal, thirty (30) days after sending written notification by certified mail of the Town’s intent to remove.
J. Sale of Facilities. To enable the Town to provide due notice, the original applicant and any subsequent owner shall notify the Town within thirty (30) days of transfer of ownership, identifying the name, address, and phone number of an appropriate contact person for the new owner.

C. Definitions
SOLAR ENERGY - Radiant energy, whether direct, diffuse, or reflected, received from the sun at wavelengths suitable for conversion into thermal or electrical energy.
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM - Equipment for the purpose of (1) collecting solar energy and (2) preparing that energy for practical use. A solar energy system includes all related equipment to generate, condition, store, and transfer energy for on-site use or for distribution onto the electrical grid. These systems include:
• Solar Photovoltaic Systems that convert sunlight into electricity through systems that include solar collection, inversion, storage and distribution; and
• Solar Thermal Systems, which are solar collection systems that directly heat water or other mediums using sunlight. Solar thermal systems are used for such purposes as space heating, domestic hot water, and heating pool water.
ROOF- OR BUILDING-MOUNTED SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM - A solar energy system attached to and supported by a building. These systems may include limited accessory equipment that is ground-mounted.
FREESTANDING SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM - A ground-mounted solar energy system, including but not limited to fixed, passive or active tracking racking systems. These systems include a system mounted on top of a freestanding car port designed and constructed specifically for mounting a system over a parking lot.
SINGLE-FAMILY OR DUPLEX RESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM – An on-site system that is designed to provide energy for the principal and accessory uses of the property.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 100 of 138
MULTIUNIT RESIDENTIAL OR NONRESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM - An on-site system that is designed to provide energy for the principal and accessory uses of the property.
SHARED/COMMUNITY SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM – A solar energy system that serves a group of local energy users situated on one or more separate lots, which are not necessarily contiguous. These systems may be connected to privately owned distribution lines or utility owned distribution or transmission lines. Users are typically connected to the shared system through a group net metering agreement, power purchasing agreement, or other similar agreement or method.
ENTERPRISE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM – A system designed to generate energy for use off-site through connection to utility owned distribution or transmission lines. These systems are a principal use of the property upon which they are sited.
RATED NAMEPLATE CAPACITY – Maximum rated alternating current (“DC”) output of solar collection system based on the combined capacity of the solar modules present in the system, measured in megawatts (MW) or kilowatts (kW).
D. Uses by district
1. Municipal Solar Energy Systems
All solar collection systems for municipal use are exempt from land use regulations pursuant to NH RSA 674:54. It is the policy of the Town of Peterborough to comply with local land use regulations to the greatest extent practicable.

§245-26. Open Space Residential Development
A. Purpose. The purposes of Open Space Residential Development (OSRD) are to encourage flexibility in the design of residential land use; promote the most efficient use of land in harmony with its natural features; provide reasonable opportunities for housing for all Peterborough residents while at the same time maintain a rural density compatible with the character of Peterborough; discourage development sprawl; preserve open space, agricultural land, tree cover, scenic vistas and wildlife habitats; and preserve undeveloped frontage along existing roads; and facilitate the economical and efficient provision of common utilities. These purposes are considered to be consistent with the Vision for Peterborough as stated in the Master Plan.
B. Definitions. The following definitions apply specifically to Open Space Residential Development. Definitions in the Peterborough Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, and Site Plan Review Regulations also apply where pertinent.
1. COMMON OPEN SPACE -- Land within or related to open space development, not individually owned, which is designed and intended for the common use or enjoyment of the residents of the development, or the public, which may contain such accessory structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for recreation and shared utilities.
2. OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (OSRD) -- A form of residential subdivision that encourages and facilitates the maximization of protected open space by allowing housing units to be grouped on sites or lots with dimensions, frontages and setbacks reduced from conventional sizes.
3. DEVELOPABLE LAND -- The land area of the total tract available for development after deducting wetlands and slopes over 25%.
4. HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION -- A private nonprofit association which is established by the developer to manage and support the activities of the open space development. Membership in said association shall be mandatory for property owners. Individual owners share common interests in open space and/or facilities and are in charge of preserving, managing and maintaining the common property, and enforcing certain covenants and restrictions. Articles of Association or Incorporation or any amendments thereto must be acceptable to the Planning Board and approved by Town Counsel.
5. TRACT -- An area, parcel, site, piece of land, or property which is the subject of development proposal and application.
C. Development Design Criteria. When considering any OSRD project, the Planning Board shall give particular attention to the following criteria, which address not only physical design standards but the cumulative effect of the proposal on the land in question, the neighborhood, and the town.
1. The proposed development will be consistent with, and comply with, the general purpose, goals, objectives, standards and provisions of the Peterborough Master Plan.
2. The individual lots, buildings, streets and parking areas shall be designed and situated as to minimize alteration of the natural, cultural and/or historic site features, and will take those features into account in the placement of all structures.
3. The suitability of all common open space shall be determined by the size, shape, topography and location for the proposed purpose, and shall be accessible to all intended users.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 104 of 138
D. General Requirements.
1. Location. Open Space Residential Development shall be permitted in all districts except the Downtown Commercial, Commercial, Industrial, Office, and Commerce Park Districts. However, the Planning Board reserves the right to disapprove or limit a proposal based on issues such as road conditions or infrastructure, for example.
2. Permitted Uses. Open Space Residential Development is limited to residential development, uses accessory thereto, and any incidental recreational uses as approved by the Planning Board.
3. Tract Area. The minimum tract area for Open Space Residential Development shall be at least ten (10) acres.
4. Allowable Density. The maximum number of dwellings shall be determined by dividing the total tract area by the minimum lot size for the district(s) in which the proposed development is located. Density shall not exceed what would be allowed in the district(s) under a conventional subdivision, except where density bonuses might apply, as specified in Paragraph H. For the purposes of this section, the minimum lot size applies only to single-family dwellings.
5. Allowable Lot and Yard Requirements. The Planning Board may, but is not required to, reduce conventional lot sizes, frontages, and setbacks for developments that meet the criteria outlined in Paragraph C above. In determining the extent to which these controls may be reduced, the Planning Board shall consider the purposes as outlined in Paragraph A and the Vision and Recommendations of relevant sections of the Peterborough Master Plan.
a. The minimum lot size for individual building lots within an Open Space Residential Development project shall be determined by the Planning Board and negotiated between the Board and the applicant.
b. Consideration shall be given to flexibility in site design and the preservation of open space; however, in no case shall the minimum lot size per dwelling be less than 25% of the required area for a lot in a conventional subdivision.
6. Frontage and Setback Requirements. The following dimensional standards are intended to create a sense of place, or neighborhood - a "pedestrian friendly" space, allowing opportunities for children to play and residents to gather in the proximity of the home.
a. Tract Dimensions.
i. Frontage. The minimum frontage from which the development gains access shall be fifty (50) feet on a town- or state-maintained road. The Planning Board reserves the right to require additional frontage to secure appropriate buffering, depending upon adjacent land uses.
ii. Setbacks. No building shall be closer than seventy-five (75) feet to the perimeter of the tract.
b. Internal Dimensions.
i. Frontage. Individual lots within the development shall front only on internal roads. The amount of frontage shall be determined by the Planning Board in order to encourage flexibility in site design. The Planning Board reserves the right to require appropriate separation between driveways.
ii. Setbacks. Front, side, and rear setbacks for individual lots within the development may be modified, as determined by the Planning Board; in no case, however, shall buildings be closer than twenty (20) feet from one another.

8. Water and Septic Systems. The design and construction of all water systems and either individual or common septic systems must be approved by the Peterborough Department of Public Works and the State of New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Proposals will be evaluated based on the potential risks in the event of a system failure. Septic systems may not be located in the common open space, unless it can be demonstrated that there will be no detrimental impact on the utility and purpose of the common open space. A backup system, however, may be placed within the common open space, as well as on-site wells.
9. Streets and Walkways.
a. All interior streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the Town of Peterborough Road Standards. In the interests of encouraging a sense of neighborhood place and scale, road width may be negotiated, but not at the expense of public safety. The Planning Board may require special safety measures, such as posted reduced speed limits, speed barriers, or other features that encourage safe use of any proposed roadway.
b. In the design and placement of walkways and sidewalks, the Planning Board shall consider pedestrian safety and the creation of a sense of neighborhood and community.
E. Common Open Space.
1. The amount of common open space in the development shall be the amount saved by reduction in lot sizes; except that at least 50% of the total tract shall be designated as permanent common open space. Land designated as common open space may not be further subdivided. The area designated for roadways may not be included in the calculation for common open space.
2. Common open space may include areas of water; it may not consist principally of land difficult to utilize. The minimum required common open space shall not consist of more than 50% of undevelopable land.
3. The area, configuration, and location of designated open space shall be as approved by the Planning Board. All areas of open space do not necessarily need to be contiguous, but consideration shall be given to connections between non-contiguous areas, as well as accessibility by all residents of the development.
4. The common open space may be used for the purposes of recreation, conservation or agriculture, as approved by the Planning Board. During the review process consideration will always be given to abutting land uses. Any future change in such designated use must be approved by the Planning Board.

1. A Homeowner's Association shall be formed to manage the common lands, as applicable, and infrastructure facilities of the development, including water and septic systems, maintenance of roads, landscaping, lighting, signage, structures, etc.
G. Open Space Ownership and Management.
1. The Common Open Space shall be held, managed and maintained by the developer until it is owned and maintained in one or more of the following ways, subject to approval by the Planning Board:
a. In common by a Homeowners Association. If an association is formed to own and maintain the common open space, it may not be dissolved without the consent of the Planning Board.
§245-24.7 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-24.7
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 106 of 138
b. By the Town of Peterborough, which may, if approved by the voters at Town Meeting, accept dedication of any portion of the common open space for perpetual public use and maintenance.
c. By a bona fide Conservation Trust registered in the State of New Hampshire or other suitable organization.
2. All common open space and facilities shall be permanently protected by covenants, easements, and/or restrictions running with the land, which must be approved by the Planning Board and Town Counsel before conveyance to the land owner(s).
3. Documents pertaining to Open Space Residential Development shall be recorded with the approved Plat.
4. The persons or entities identified as having the rights of ownership over the common open space shall be responsible for its continued upkeep and proper maintenance.
5. The common open space in an approved development is considered to be part of the residential use of the development and shall not be considered to be eligible for any current use taxation assessments under RSA 79-A, except where such use consists of actively operated farmland.
H. Density Bonus for Innovative Open Space Protection.
1. The Planning Board may award the development a density bonus that increases the maximum number of dwelling units available under conventional subdivision. Bonuses may be awarded from any combination of the following criteria, but in no case shall be bonus result in more than a 25% increase in dwelling units. If the calculation results in a fraction, that number will be rounded down.
2. Any of the following criteria that are the basis for a density bonus are considered to be part of the project approval and may not be altered or terminated, except with written approval of the Planning Board following a public hearing on the change.
a. Additional Open Space Bonus. 10%, where the proposed OSRD plan shows 60% or more of the tract as open space protected as such in perpetuity, OR 20% where the proposed OSRD plan shows 70% or more of the tract as open space protected as such in perpetuity.
b. Trails Bonus. 5%, where there is a linking of existing/proposed trails or open space networks with trail corridors through the site, and the general public is granted access to these trails in perpetuity. The minimum nature of public access required to trigger this bonus is pedestrian traffic. The instrument granting access, acceptable to the planning board, shall restrict the use of motorized vehicles where appropriate.
c. Agricultural Land and Use Bonus. 10%, where the development protects agriculturally valuable lands and provides permission for their use as such in perpetuity. If the portion preserved for agricultural use is equal to 25% or more of the tract, then the full bonus may be awarded, with a smaller bonus awarded for smaller percentages, but also taking into consideration the importance of the land for preserving the rural character of the Town. The instrument granting use, acceptable to the Planning Board, may reasonably restrict the type of intensity of farming to occur to prevent nuisances. This provision only requires that permission is available; the fact that agricultural uses are not pursued at any particular time does not affect the validity of the bonus; however, at a minimum, fields should not be allowed to become overgrown, but be kept open by mowing.
§245-26 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-28
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 107 of 138
d. Forest Management Bonus. 15%, on sites where the open space to be preserved is mostly mature forest (70% or greater), where 30% or less of the basal area will be cut, and where the cutting is well distributed and will be based on a management plan developed by a NH Licensed Forester and approved by the Planning Board.
e. View Shed and Viewpoint Bonus. 5%, if the development protects in perpetuity view sheds and associated viewpoints, which are lands or corridors of land that contribute to the visual landscape of the Town, including items such as open fields containing stonewalls and forested hillsides. View sheds and viewpoints identified in the Master Plan and the Town’s Natural Resource Inventory will be given priority consideration.
f. Historic Features Bonus. 5%, if the development protects in perpetuity historically significant buildings and landscapes, identified as such in the Master Plan that include buildings and associated uses that are maintained and visually separated from the developed portion of the OSRD. Structures or landscapes not identified as such through the Master Plan may be determined by sufficient evidence presented to the Planning Board during review of the development. Such evidence may include comment from the Heritage Commission or Historical Society, listing or eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Landmarks, or other qualified statements of historic value.
I. Review Process.
1. All proposals for OSRD are subject to subdivision approval. Conceptual discussions with the Planning Board are encouraged before any final approvals are sought. In addition, relevant sections of the Site Plan Review Regulations will be applied, including but not limited to issues around traffic, signage, lighting, etc.
2. Although OSRD projects may be subdivided and developed in phases, no incremental approvals will be granted. The entire tract to be considered for development must be presented as a whole so that the Planning Board may consider the entirety of the project.
3. It is the intent of this section to authorize the Planning Board to modify any of the requirements herein as deemed reasonable by the Board.
§ 245-27. Incentive Zoning [Repealed]
§ 245-28. Phased development
A. The purpose of this section is to regulate residential growth in Peterborough in a manner which will ensure that public services and facilities can be provided to the new residents without creating undue burdens on the town which could result from large population increases in a short period of time. The objectives of these phased development regulations are to:
1. Provide for the current and future housing needs of existing residents and their families, while accommodating Peterborough's fair share of the population growth in the region.
2. Assure fairness in the development of large residential projects.
3. Ensure that this provision does not unduly increase construction costs to builders by preventing them from erecting or creating several dwelling units as part of one (1) project.
4. Plan for the continued residential growth of Peterborough at a rate which will be compatible with the orderly and gradual expansion of community services, including education, fire protection, police protection, road maintenance, waste disposal, recreation, etc.
§245-28 TOWN OF PETERBOROUGH §245-28
ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 108 of 138
B. Applicability. For any type of residential development involving the construction of dwelling units which will increase the total town population (the best estimate thereof) by more than one percent (1%), a phasing schedule shall be submitted as part of the completed application for development review. For subdivisions that do not involve the construction of dwellings by the subdivider which will increase the towns population by more than two percent (2%), a phasing schedule shall be submitted as part of the completed application for subdivision review. In such cases, no more than nineteen (19) lots may be purchased by any single builder or contractor for the purpose of constructing dwellings for speculation sale. [In other words, if the development involves the construction of single family dwellings, duplexes, or multi-family units, the threshold is one percent (1%). But if the subdivider intends to sell lots to individual buyers for them to build their own homes on, then the threshold is two percent (2%).
C. Said phasing schedule shall specify the location, type and number of units to be occupied in each year of the project. The phasing schedule shall be administered through the issuance of occupancy permits, in order to allow flexibility in the construction of the units.
D. The population statistics to be used in determining the phasing schedule shall be those published in the Planning Board's documents and used by the Board. An applicant may submit alternative statistics, along with an explanation of the methodology used to obtain them and a justification for using them. The Planning Board shall review any such alternative statistics and reserves the right to reject them if the Board has information indicating that other statistics are more accurate. If no statistics are available, the Office of State Planning projections shall be used to calculate by linear regression the annual population for the years needed.
E. In reviewing the phasing schedule, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the following:
1. No individual phase shall increase the town's population by more than one percent (1%) in any given year. The maximum number of units in each phase shall be calculated using the appropriate multipliers for New England as published in the most recent version of the New Practitioner's Guide to Fiscal Impact Analysis by the Center for Urban Policy Research, Rutgers University. The type of housing and the appropriate number of bedrooms shall be used to calculate each phase individually. Other statistics may be presented to the Planning Board and are subject to the Board's review and acceptance.
2. The Planning Board shall not require a phasing schedule so strict as to limit the project to a number of units per year which would render the project financially unfeasible. The Board shall use its best judgment regarding this issue.
F. The Planning Board shall review this section at least once every three (3) years to determine the appropriateness of the percent increases allowed.

§ 245-29. Continuation
A. Any lawful use of buildings, structures, premises, land or parts thereof existing at the effective date of this chapter and made nonconforming by its provisions or any amendments thereto may be continued subject to the provisions of this Article.
§ 245-30. Enlargement, Change, or Replacement of Nonconforming Uses
A. Any use of a property made legally nonconforming by the district provisions of this chapter may be replaced only by a special exception granted by the Board of Adjustment provided:
1. The Board of Adjustment finds that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the zoning district than the existing nonconforming use.
2. The nonconforming use of the property has not ceased for any reason for a period of one (1) year or more within the last three (3) years prior to making application. This provision does not apply when the property owner can offer evidence that there has been no intent to discontinue the use.
B. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a permitted use, such use shall not thereafter revert to a nonconforming status, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter.
C. Any reconstruction or repair of a partially destroyed, demolished or damaged structure which contains a nonconforming use must be commenced within one (1) year of such damage or destruction, and the reconstruction completed and the structure suitable for occupancy within two (2) years of such damage or destruction.

§ 245-31. Lots of record
A. In any district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other sections of this ordinance, single lots of record at the effective date of this ordinance may be built upon, provided that the setbacks are complied with. However, if such lot abuts one or more lots in the same ownership, and any of them are nonconforming to the size, frontage, or setback requirements for the district, then § 245-31B shall apply.
B. All contiguous lots owned by the same entity, including but not limited to an individual, corporation, partnership, or trust, shall not be transferred as a buildable lot for the construction of any structure without obtaining subdivision approval from the Planning Board, unless each of the individual lots complies with all size, frontage, and setback requirements for the District in which it is located except for those lots that had dwellings located upon them at the enactment of zoning (March 10, 1970). In cases where a subdivision approval is required, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the character and density of the surrounding area, the size of the surrounding lots, and, if not on the public sewer system, the ability of the available land area on each of the subject lots to support a septic system. The Planning Board may require that lot lines be shifted in order to bring the lots closer into compliance with the District requirements.
C. A nonconforming lot may be enlarged, even though the enlargement does not make the lot conforming.
D. Minor lot line adjustments between nonconforming lots are permitted provided the change does not render the lot unusable for its allowed purpose.

A. Number of Spaces.
1. Off-street parking must be provided to service all increases in parking demand resulting from new construction, additions, conversion of residential property to business use, or conversion of any building to multi-family residential use. Any existing spaces removed shall be replaced in kind unless they are in excess of the number required. Parking spaces also serving as loading areas shall not be credited. The number of spaces provided shall be determined to meet these requirements if either the total number of resulting spaces is adequate to serve all proposed uses on the premises, or if the net addition in spaces is adequate to serve the net added parking demand, as indicated by the requirements of §245-32 A(2). [Reference updated]
2. Schedule of Requirements. The required parking spaces specified in Table #1 are calculated per
1,000 square feet of gross floor area, unless otherwise indicated.
3. The number of spaces may be reduced to less than that stipulated in §245-32 A(2) if, in acting on site plan review, the Planning Board or Minor Site Plan Review Committee determines that a smaller number would be adequate for all parking needs.
4. For purpose of meeting the minimum parking requirements for new residential development, a garage or carport bay shall qualify as a parking space. Tandem parking on the driveway, including the portion of the driveway in front of a garage or carport bay, may also qualify to meet minimum parking requirements provided that the space closest to the road is set back behind the front building line of the house.

§ 245-33. Pollution and disturbance
A. Purpose: to establish controls for the following types of pollution and disturbances: noise, light and glare, air quality, hazardous materials, vibration, and electrical disturbance, in order to protect the health, safety, and the quality of the environment.
B. Applicability.
1. All applicants for subdivision, site plan review, special exceptions, or building permits shall be subject to the following standards. The Planning Board, Zoning Board of Adjustment, or Code Enforcement Officer shall grant approvals only upon their determination that the resulting use or development will comply with the following standards, or will not increase the extent or degree of any existing noncompliance with them.
2. If the Planning Board, Zoning Board of Adjustment, or Code Enforcement Officer determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the use or development may result in noncompliance, they may require the applicant to submit evidence sufficient to enable them to make an objective determination, such as:
a. documentation of the performance of similar facilities or processes on other sites; and/or
b. specifications for the mechanisms and techniques involved; and/or
c. certification of compliance by an engineer acceptable to the Planning Board, Zoning Board of Adjustment, or Code Enforcement Officer for his (the engineer’s) competence in the relevant field and lack of conflict in the case involved.
3. The Planning Board, Zoning Board of Adjustment, or Code Enforcement Officer may, at the applicant’s request and expense, engage an expert consultant to conduct a study and provide a report on compliance, and on means of mitigating any potential noncompliance.
4. The following standards shall not apply to:
a. warning devices, temporary construction or maintenance work, parades, special events, or similar temporary or transient circumstances; or
b. one- and two-family dwellings and permitted accessory uses thereto.
5. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may as a special exception authorize a use not in compliance with the following, upon its determination that peculiarities of the location or activity assure that there will be no adverse disturbance to the use and enjoyment of nearby premises, and that the greatest degree of compliance reasonably feasible has been provided.
C. Noise.
1. On-site activities shall not at any point beyond the boundary of the premises result in sound levels which commonly exceed the ambient (background) level by more than 10 decibels or exceed the ambient level at any time by more than fifteen (15) decibels. Sound not discernible with normal human hearing two hundred (200) feet beyond a point on the boundary of the premises is presumed not to exceed the ambient level by more than ten (10) decibels at that point.
2. Vehicles parked on the premises and idling are subject to this standard, but traffic on streets is not.
3. Exemptions:
a. On-site emergency generators needed to provide power during electrical outages are exempt from the provisions of subparagraph (1) above.
b. Customary uses associated with one- and two-family residences, such as air conditioners.

ZONING ORDINANCE
As of December 27, 2019 Page 114 of 138
D. Light and glare.
1. Purpose: To create standards so that outdoor lighting does not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of property within Peterborough. These standards reduce light trespass, glare, and light pollution, and promote conservation of energy, while maintaining nighttime safety, security, and productivity.
2. Lighting shall be designed to adequately illuminate the site and parking areas without causing glare or excessive illumination on neighboring properties or streets. Glare from vehicle headlights shall be mitigated through location and design of egresses, landscaping, and screening. Illumination of illuminated areas from light fixtures shall comply with Table #3, which gives the allowable foot-candles for various types of light fixtures in varying heights, for the different zoning districts.
3. All outdoor light fixtures shall be shielded so that no direct light is projected above a horizontal plane passing through the light source.
4. Light sources to illuminate signs shall be located above the objects to be illuminated and shall be shielded so that the light source is not visible from public ways and adjacent property.
5. Acceptable light sources are metal halide, incandescent, neon tubing, fluorescent, and LED. All other light sources including any flickering or pulsing light are prohibited. Processes which create light flashes such as, but not limited to, electric arc welding, shall be confined to buildings or shielded to prevent either glare of flashes reflected from the sky. [Amended 5/10/16]
6. Outdoor lighting shall be turned off or reduced in intensity by 11:00 p.m. unless an activity being lighted extends beyond that time. Lighting of display lots such as but not limited to, automobile sales or rental, recreational vehicle sales, or building material sales shall be turned off within (30) thirty minutes after closing at the end of the business day. Any lighting used after work hours shall be security lighting only, reduced from the level of full illumination lighting. Similarly, lighting or parking lots shall either be turned off or noticeably reduced to security levels after the closing of business. The intention of this requirement is to reduce after-hours illumination to the greatest extent while recognizing the need for security lighting.
7. Lighting shall be located, shielded, and maintained to prevent light trespass onto adjacent properties and public ways; measured at the boundary of the illuminated and adjacent property in excess of 0.1 foot-candles.

j. Properties that share a driveway or other access way or have adjoining parking areas may have lighting trespass over the shared property lines subject to agreement of all parties. Such agreement shall be in writing and filed with the application.
9. Owners or operators of non-conforming fixtures or installations are encouraged to bring their outdoor lighting into voluntary compliance with these requirements.
E. Air quality.
1. No non-agricultural use shall cause the recurrent emission of odors detectable more than two hundred (200) feet beyond the boundary of the premises for receptors within an Industrial district, or more than one hundred (100) feet beyond the boundary of the premises for receptors in any other district.
2. Off-site transmission of dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from such sources as storage areas, yards, roads, and driveways, shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, or other acceptable means.
F. Hazardous materials. If the products manufactured are toxic or hazardous as defined at §245-14B, manufacturing as the principal use of the premises may be allowed only if granted a special exception under §245-33H, upon determination by the Zoning Board of Adjustment that:
1. facility location, design, and contingency preparations adequately protect against risk to public health or environmental qualities; and
2. for development within an Groundwater Overlay Zone, the requirements of §245-14, Groundwater Overlay Zone, are fully met.
G. Vibration. No use shall be permitted which produces vibrations recurrently perceptible, without instruments, at any point beyond the boundaries of the premises.

involved and substances to be emitted, a description of precautions, handling practices, monitoring, and recovery systems proposed, and, if appropriate, a hazard prevention and contingency response plan.
2. Decision criteria. Special exceptions shall be granted if the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds that in light of peculiarities of location or circumstance:
a. the proposed use will not cause unreasonable risk of harm or adverse disturbance to the environment or to other premises, and
b. will not jeopardize health or safety either on or off the site, and
c. that either any control or safety systems being relied upon are fail-safe or redundant, or it has been demonstrated that there would be no adverse health or safety consequences beyond the boundaries of the premises in the event of system failure, in light of on-site decay, dilution, or dispersion.
§ 245-34. Manufactured housing
A. In conformity with New Hampshire RSA 674:32, manufactured housing, if placed upon a permanent foundation, is allowed in the General Residence District and in the Rural District.
B. Manufactured housing not placed on a permanent foundation is allowed in the town under the following circumstances:
1. Pursuant to the provisions of § 245-8B(3) of this chapter (must be located in a manufactured housing park).
2. By special exception of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, manufactured homes not on permanent foundations are allowed in the rural district for a period not to exceed two (2) years while a permanent residence is being constructed on the property, provided the conditions listed in §245-17 are met.

§ 245-35. Farmland preservation
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow landowners a reasonable return on their holdings, in such a way that the majority of existing open fields and pasture may remain open for use by future generations. Towards this end, all residential subdivision development proposals encompassing five (5) or more acres of existing open fields, pastures, or orchards shall be laid out according to the open space residential development standards set forth in § 245-26 and in a manner consistent with the Peterborough Land Subdivision Regulations.7 If the parcel which is proposed for development also contains land which is neither open field nor pasture nor orchard, new dwellings shall be clustered on such land to the most practical extent so that the fields, pastures, or orchards remain as undeveloped as possible.
B. Building density.
1. The building density in each zoning district shall be based upon the following table, which shows the percentage of land in various drainage categories which may be counted as suitable soil for development:
2. In order to determine the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on a tract of land, the total acreage allowed to be included (on the basis of the above table), less the land needed for roads, is divided by the maximum lot size required in the zoning district. A high-intensity soils survey by a soils scientist qualified by the New Hampshire State Conservation Committee shall be submitted to certify the extent and location of these soil types.
C. Preservation of agricultural soil. In reference to said open fields, pastures, and orchards, to the fullest extent practicable, all buildings and roads shall be located away from the soils which are rated as important farmlands under the prime and state-wide criteria as listed by the Hillsborough County Conservation District and said high-intensity soils survey. This provision does not apply to the location of on-site septic disposal facilities, which must be placed on soil meeting the standards of the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission and the Town of Peterborough.
D. Open field preservation. Applicants for subdivision review under this section shall provide the Planning Board with copies of deed covenants (with prospective purchasers) or conservation easements (with the Town of Peterborough) describing land management practices (to be followed by the developer and/or a community association of condominium or land owners), which ensure that the existing fields, orchards, or pastures will be plowed or mowed at least once per year.

§ 245-43. Special exception for elderly housing
A. Purpose. It is declared to be in the public interest and the general welfare of the Town of Peterborough to encourage the development of housing for the elderly/ handicapped, as defined by the regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, pursuant to § 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1973, as amended, as they are now written or are later amended. The purpose of this section is to establish some of the special exception conditions which such a use must satisfy, and where these regulations differ from other sections of the Town Zoning Law, the provision of this section shall take precedence. However, any elderly housing must meet all other provisions of the Zoning Law, Building Code, and Subdivision Regulations.8
B. Special exception conditions shall be as follows:
1. Any site proposed for elderly housing under this section shall be allowed in all districts except Business/Industrial and Office, and used only in conformity with the regulations cited in Subsection A of this section, as those regulations are now written or later amended.
2. The review of any site proposed for elderly housing shall take into account its proximity to those support services (i.e., shopping, medical, public transportation, places of worship, etc.) necessary to meet the needs of the elderly.
3. Recognizing the desirability of locating elderly housing developments within the more intensively developed areas of the community where related support services are usually available, the problems of land assemblage within these developed areas and the potential social, cultural, and physical advantages to the elderly of group living, the Board shall permit a density level of not more than ten (10) units per acre for elderly housing projects.
4. Recognizing the limited active recreational demands of the elderly in relation to the more typical multifamily occupant, the Board shall permit a reduction in the required lot area to not less than four thousand (4,000) square feet per dwelling unit.
5. In determining the number of required on-site parking spaces, the Board shall permit a ratio of a minimum of one (1) parking space for every two (2) dwellings.
6. Recognizing the potential physical limitations of the elderly, the Board may permit a vehicular drop-off area to the building within the required front yard area within a district.
§ 245-44. Special exception for low- and moderate-income housing
A. Purpose. It is declared to be in the public interest and the general welfare of the Town of Peterborough to encourage the development of low- and moderate-income housing, as defined below. In order to accomplish this, those developments which qualify under the conditions listed below shall be granted a special exception and be exempted from the provisions of Article § 245-28, Phased development.
B. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
1. LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING - Housing which is specifically funded by local, state, or federal government agencies or by private individuals or organizations for the use of economically disadvantaged persons. Low Income shall mean those families earning less than fifty percent (50%) of the median family income for Hillsborough County, and Moderate Income shall mean those families earning between fifty percent (50%) and eighty percent (80%) of the median family income for Hillsborough County.
a. The median family income for Hillsborough County is determined by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and can be obtained from the NH Office of Energy and Planning.

(A) The Peterborough Planning Board (“the Board”) shall consist of seven members, who shall be elected in accordance with RSA 673:2 & 669:17. One of the seven is an ex officio, representing the Board of Selectmen. The Selectmen’s representative is a full voting member of the Planning Board.
(B) Except for the Selectmen’s representative, members shall be elected for three-year terms, with no more than three members standing for election in any given year. Terms of office shall commence at the first regular Planning Board meeting after the annual Town Meeting. The term of the Selectmen’s representative shall coincide with the term of that office.
(C) At its first regular meeting following the annual Town Meeting, the Board shall elect from among its members a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman. These officers shall serve for one year. The Selectmen’s representative may not serve as Chairman.
(D) The Board may appoint up to five alternate members for a term of three years each.
(E) Vacancies in the Board (other than the Selectmen’s representative) shall be filled by the remaining Board members until the next regular election at which time a successor shall be elected to either fill the unexpired term or start a new term, as appropriate.
II. DUTIES OF OFFICERS
(A) The Chairman shall preside over meetings and shall be responsible for the conduct and decorum of the meeting. The Chairman shall ensure that all parties receive a full and fair hearing before the Board.
(B) Whenever the Chairman is absent or disqualified to act in a particular case, the duties of chairman shall be performed by the Vice-Chairman, or another member designated by the Board.
(C) When feasible, the member that serves as Chair for an initial application shall continue to serve as Chair until the application has been acted on.
III. MEETINGS
(A) For the purpose of this section, a “meeting” means the convening of a quorum of the board, whether in person, by means of telephone or electronic communication, email, or in any other manner such that all participating members are able to communicate with each other contemporaneously, for the purpose of discussing or acting upon a matter or matters over which the Board has jurisdiction. This does not include chance meetings, meetings convened by other boards, committees, or entities at which a quorum of the Planning Board finds itself present, or social meetings, provided no board business is discussed, nor decisions made.

(1) E-Mail: Board members may use E-mail to schedule and confirm meetings, to circulate draft documents that will be presented at public meetings, or to correspond with the Office of Community Development regarding working documents, agenda items or other administrative business. Official business1 should not be conducted by E-mail. Such a discussion would be in violation of the Right-to-Know Law. E-mail correspondence may be subject to disclosure as “public documents.”
(B) A quorum of the Board is required in order to transact any business. Four (4) members constitute a quorum of the Planning Board.
(C) Regular meetings of the Board are held at 6:30 P.M. on the second Monday of each month at the Town House.
(D) In the event a regular member is absent or disqualified, the Chairman shall designate an alternate to act in the absent member’s place. Except that an absent ex officio member can only be replaced by another Selectman. Alternate members’ voting privileges will be announced at each meeting by the Chair. Alternate members are encouraged to participate in all Board meetings.
(E) Special meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the Chairman, or by request of a majority of the members. Special meetings do not require a quorum, unless a vote is to be taken. Special meetings will be posted for: (1) informal public input, or (2) a Planning Board Workshop.
(1) The purpose of workshops is for the full Board to conduct its work in preparation for presentation to the public, or for work groups of members to present to the full Board.
(2) While the public is always welcome to attend, input is only by invitation from the Chair or the work group. Since workshops typically do not need to meet the same public notification requirements as a public hearing, the Board must be careful to not allow undue influence into the process from those that attend workshops over those who only attend the public hearings.
(3) Input can be taken if the work group or Board sees fit, or it may feel the time allowed for the workshop does not provide adequate time for the group to conduct its work and take public input at the same meeting. (The public has full voice at Public Hearings after due notice.)
(4) Therefore, the general rule of thumb is that the work group or Board will conduct its business first and then if time allows, open the meeting to public input. The members will take the input under advisement and will not engage in debate.
1 For the purposes of this document, “official business” means taking votes or engaging in discussions that pertain to formal applications. This does not preclude emails between the Board and OCD regarding agenda items.

(F) NOTIFICATION
(1) Notice of all special meetings, of the omission of any regular meeting, and of any change in the time or place of a regular meeting shall be posted in the following manner:
? At the Office of Community Development
? On the Community Bulletin Board in the Town House
? At the Town Library
(2) Regular meetings and special meetings require a 24-hour notice, although in most cases these notices will be posted well in advance of that.
(G) Public Hearings on development applications, Master Plans, or any land use regulations are held at the regular meeting on the second Monday of the month, or unless otherwise scheduled by the Board. Notices of public hearings are posted in the same manner as in paragraph E above, as well as a notice in the Town’s official newspaper of record. Public hearings require a 10-day notification, not counting the day the notice appears or the day of the hearing. If more than one public hearing is held on a zoning ordinance or amendment, there must be 14 days between the last and the next hearing.
(H) All meetings are open to the public except those that fall within RSA 91-A: 3 for nonpublic sessions. At public meetings any person is permitted to be present, and to record the meeting, but is not allowed to speak unless recognized by the Chair. Public hearings, on the other hand, are for the purpose of receiving testimony from the public.

(A) Anyone wishing to submit proposals to the Planning Board for amendments to any of the Land Use Regulations must do so no later than the October regulatory meeting.
2 Final proposals must be submitted to the Town Clerk by the fifth Tuesday prior to Town Meeting. Generally this means that the last week in January or the first of February is the deadline for public hearings. Furthermore, hearings on zoning amendments require a full 14 days between hearings.
6
(B) The OCD will review the proposals and provide a written report to the Board at the November regulatory meeting. The Board will vote on which, if any, proposals to support, and schedule the public hearings. (Note that a second public hearing is required only if there are substantive changes to the proposal.)
(C) Petitions to amend the zoning ordinance must be submitted to the Selectmen no earlier than 120 days, and no later than 90 days prior to Town Meeting. Upon receipt, the Selectmen will submit the petition(s) to the Planning Board at the next regular meeting of the Board, at which time a public hearing on the petition(s) will be scheduled. At that public hearing, the Board will vote whether to support or not support the petition(s).
(D) When amendments to the zoning ordinance are proposed, the Chair shall assign each proposal to a planning board member(s) who shall be responsible for overseeing that amendment through the process. That member(s) will work with the OCD Director in the drafting of language and the preparation for workshops, public hearing(s) on that amendment. The posting of any proposed amendments will include the name of the steward(s) of each proposal.
