§ 20-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Ethics Law of the Town of Irondequoit."
§ 20-2. Purpose.
The proper administration of the government of the Town of Irondequoit
requires its officers and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or
unpaid, to be independent, impartial and free from conflicts of interest in
fulfilling their public responsibilities so that the public will have confidence
in the integrity of its town government. The purpose of this chapter is to
Town, as well as appeals from the provisions of such laws, as
authorized by the Town Board, and to prepare and keep records of
all Zoning Board of Appeals proceedings and decisions.
(4) Conservation Board: to provide administrative and staff support to
the Town's Conservation Board.
(5) Environmental quality review (SEQRA): to coordinate and advise
each board in regards to the determinations, findings and filing of
notices and recordkeeping requirements for all Town actions as
required under Article 8 of the New York State Environmental
Conservation Law and its corresponding rules and regulations,
more commonly referred to as the "State Environmental Quality
Review Act" (SEQRA).
(6) Floodplain management: to administer and manage the Town's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and issue Flood Insurance Rate
Map certificates upon request by the public.
(7) Surplus Town lands: to coordinate and administer the sale and
disposition of surplus Town lands.
(8) Other responsibilities: to perform such other duties and functions
that are prescribed to be performed by the Department in any law,
ordinance or resolution of the Town Board or lawful direction of the
Supervisor. However, the Director of Planning and Zoning may
delegate any of the powers or direct any of the duties to be
performed by any of his or her subordinates.

§ 18-3 ETHICS § 20-2
20:25
establish minimum standards for the ethical conduct of town officers and
employees to help ensure that the business of town government is free from
improper influence that may result from opportunities for private gain. At
the same time, it is recognized that public service cannot require a complete
divesting of all proprietary interests, nor impose overly burdensome
disclosure requirements, if local governments are to attract and hold
competent administrators. Although the assurance of ethical conduct will
continue to rest primarily on the personal integrity of the officers and
employees themselves, on the commitment of elected and appointed
officials and on the vigilance of their communities, the establishment of
the standards and guidelines set forth in this chapter is an additional
step toward providing the highest caliber of public administration of local
government and increased confidence in public officials. By requiring public
disclosure of financial interests that may influence or be perceived to
influence the actions of public officials, this chapter is intended to facilitate
consideration of potential problems before they arise, to minimize
unwarranted suspicion and to enhance the accountability of government to
the people.

§ 20-4 ETHICS § 20-6

include at least one member who is an elected or appointed town officer
or employee.

statement to request the Board to delete from the copy thereof
made available for public inspection one or more items of
information, which may be deleted by the Board upon a finding by a
majority of the total number of members of the Board without
vacancy that information which would otherwise be required to be
disclosed will have no material bearing on the discharge of the
reporting person's official duties. If such request for deletion is
§ 20-6 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 20-6
20:30
denied, the Board, in its notification of denial, shall inform the
person of his or her right to appeal the Board's determination
pursuant to its rules governing adjudicatory proceedings and
appeals adopted pursuant to Subsection H of this section.
(8) Permit any person required to file a financial disclosure statement
to request an exemption from any requirement to report one or
more items of information which pertain to such person's spouse or
unemancipated children, which item or items may be exempted by
the Board upon a finding by a majority of the total number of
members of the Board without vacancy that the reporting
individual's spouse, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of an
unemancipated child, objects to providing the information
necessary to make such disclosure and that the information which
would otherwise be required to be reported will have no material
bearing on the discharge of the reporting person's official duties. If
such request for exemption is denied, the Board in its notification of
denial, shall inform the person of his or her right to appeal the
Board's determination pursuant to its rules governing adjudicatory
proceedings and appeals adopted pursuant to Subsection H of this
section.
(9) Permitting any person who has not been determined by his or her
appointing authority to hold a policy-making position but who is
otherwise required to file a financial disclosure statement to
request an exemption from such requirement in accordance with
rules and regulations governing such exemptions. Such rules and
regulations shall provide for exemptions to be granted either on the
application of an individual or on behalf of persons who share the
same job title or employment classification which the Board deems
to be comparable for purposes of this section. Such rules and
regulations may permit the granting of an exemption where, in the
discretion of the Board, the public interest does not require
disclosure and the applicant's duties do not involve the negotiation,
authorization or approval of:
(a) Contracts, leases, franchises, revocable consents, concessions,
variances, special permits or licenses as defined in § 73 of the
Public Officers Law, as amended or changed;
(b) The purchase, sale, rental or lease of real property, goods or
services or a contract therefor;

(d) The adoption or repeal of any rule or regulation having the
force and effect of law.
D. The Board may determine a question common to a class or defined
category of persons or items of information required to be disclosed,
where determination of the question will prevent undue repetition of
§ 20-6 ETHICS § 20-6
20:31
requests for exemption or deletion or prevent undue complication in
complying with the requirements of such section.
E. The Board shall inspect all financial disclosure statements filed with the
Board to ascertain whether any person subject to the reporting
requirements of this chapter has failed to file such a statement, has
filed a deficient statement or has filed a statement which reveals a
possible violation of any provision of this chapter or Article 18 of the
General Municipal Law, as amended or changed.
F. If a person required to file a financial disclosure statement with the
Board has failed to file a disclosure statement or has filed a deficient
statement, the Board shall notify the reporting person, in writing, state
the failure to file or detail the deficiency, provide the person with a
fifteen-day period to cure the deficiency and advise the person of the
penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirements. Such
notice shall be confidential if the person makes such filing or cures the
deficiency within the specified time period. If the person fails to make
such filing or fails to cure the deficiency within the specified time
period, the Board shall send a notice of delinquency:
(1) To the reporting person; and
(2) To the appointing authority for such person.
G. If a reporting person has filed a statement which reveals a possible
violation of this chapter or the Board receives a sworn complaint
alleging such a violation or if the Board determines on its own initiative
to investigate a possible violation, the Board shall notify the reporting
person, in writing, describe the possible or alleged violation of this
chapter and provide the person with a fifteen-day period in which to
submit a written response setting forth information relating to the
activities cited as possible or alleged violation of law. If the Board
thereafter makes a determination that further inquiry is justified, it
shall give the reporting person an opportunity to be heard. The Board
shall also inform the reporting individual of its rules regarding the
conduct of adjudicatory proceedings and appeals and the due process
procedural mechanisms available to such individual. If the Board
determines at any stage of the proceeding that there is no violation or
that any potential conflict of interest violation has been rectified, it shall
so advise the reporting person and the complainant, if any. All of the
foregoing proceedings shall be confidential except if the Board
determines that there is a violation or that any potential conflict of
interest violation has not been rectified. If the Board determines that
there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, it
shall send a notice of reasonable cause:
(1) To the reporting person;
(2) To the complainant, if any; and
(3) To the appointing authority for such person.
§ 20-6 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 20-6
20:32

2-4-1997 by L.L. No. 1-1997; 12-15-1998 by L.L. No. 8-1998]
The Town of Irondequoit recognizes that matters of finance do exist which
are so personal in nature and are so unrelated to the performance and
duties of a municipal officer or employee that no useful purpose can be
served by such disclosure. Nonetheless, certain financial information may
be relevant to the duties of a municipal officer or employee and impact upon
the integrity of the town government, and to that end:
N. The Town Board shall appropriate necessary and sufficient moneys for
the maintenance and personal services to be provided by the Board.
A. All elected town officials, department heads and their deputies and
assistants, policymakers and those officers and employees whose duties
involve the negotiation, authorization or approval of any of the matters

Law, as amended or changed, and each candidate for elected town
office shall file with the Board an annual statement of financial
disclosure containing the information and in the form set forth in
Appendix A8 as the same may be amended from time to time by the
Town Board, provided that any such amendment to the disclosure
statement shall provide for not less than the minimum level of financial
disclosure as required by Article 18 of the General Municipal Law,
amended or changed. Such statements shall be filed only with the
Board within 90 days after the effective date of this chapter or within 30
days of taking office and no later than the 15th day of May with respect
to the preceding calendar year. The time for filing such statements may
be extended, pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted by the
Board for justifiable cause and/or undue hardship, upon application to
the Board. For the purposes of this section, all persons required to file
an annual statement of financial disclosure will be referred to as
"employees."

exempted in accordance with § 20-5 above.
D. Any part of a financial disclosure statement that has been granted
confidentiality or exempt status by the Board pursuant to the
employee's request shall be maintained by the Board as confidential
information. It shall be a violation for any Board member or any other
individual, except for the employee who filed the statement, to disclose
any information that has been granted confidential and/or exempt
status. Such violation shall be punishable by a fine of not more than
$500, as may be determined by the Board.
E. If the Board, in accordance with its rules and regulations, determines
that any part of a financial disclosure statement filed with it which has
not been granted confidentiality or exempt status by the Board
pursuant to a request by the employee should be made public, the same
will be filed with the Town Clerk as a public record, and any part of the
statement which has been granted exemption or deletion by the Board
shall be deleted before the same is so filed, and the original information
shall be retained by the Board pursuant to Subsection D above.
Categories of amounts shall be confidential.
F. If, after review of the statement, the Board determines that a conflict of
interest exists or that there appears to be an impropriety that could

conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety may be rectified.
(4) If the employee fails to respond to the Board within 15 days of the
receipt of the Board's opinion of impropriety or if an agreement to
eliminate the conflict cannot be reached with the employee,
acceptable to the Board, the Board shall publicly disclose the
employee's statement or relevant portions of such statement along
with the Board's opinion by filing them with the Town Clerk.
(5) The Board shall determine such penalties for violation of any
provision of this chapter in accordance with § 813 of the General
Municipal Law, as amended or changed.

professional associations have set down standards of conduct for their
members, the town hereby requires that each officer or employee who
is affected by a professional Code of Ethics be bound, in addition to the
within chapter, by their respective Codes of Ethics. Any conflict
between the provisions of this chapter and a given officer's or

§ 48-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Police Jurisdiction Agreements with the

§ 48-2. Purpose.
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Genesee
River fishing access site located at the northerly terminus of St. Paul
Boulevard ("the DEC fishing site") is located within the political boundaries
of the City of Rochester. Culver Road from the boundary line between
the Town of Irondequoit and the City of Rochester (which line is 150 feet
north of Norton Street) to Hoffman Road is also located within the political
boundaries of the City of Rochester. Both the DEC fishing site and said
section of Culver Road are surrounded by the political boundaries of the
Town of Irondequoit, thereby creating the public perception that such areas
are within the political boundaries of the Town of Irondequoit. Because
of such perception, the Irondequoit Police Department is contacted by the
public for police enforcement for criminal and traffic matters in these areas.
The Town of Irondequoit and the City of Rochester desire to clarify the
municipal/legal responsibility for these areas and to that end will enter
into a municipal cooperation relative to the police jurisdiction for the DEC
fishing site and have entered into a municipal cooperation agreement dated
December 29, 1988, for said portion of Culver Road. These agreements will
and do provide that the Irondequoit Police Department will have full police
jurisdiction of these areas for all criminal matters, offenses, petty offenses
and violations of all motor vehicle traffic matters.
§ 48-3. DEC fishing site.
All law enforcement officers of the Town of Irondequoit shall have authority
to enforce violations of all offenses and petty offenses committed on the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Genesee River
fishing access site located at the northerly terminus of St. Paul Boulevard
situate within the political boundaries of the City of Rochester pursuant

PROCUREMENT POLICY
GENERAL REFERENCES
Investment policy  See Ch. 28.
§ 51-1. Compliance with state law; sealed bidding; exceptions to
sealed bidding.
A. The Town of Irondequoit has adopted the policies and procedures
described herein, to comply with General Municipal Law (GML), §§ 103
and 104-b. Section 104-b was enacted in 1992 and required
municipalities to further define how procurements were made in
accordance with § 103.
B. Public sealed bidding is required for the initial purchase of an item or
group of similar items costing more than $20,000, or if it is reasonably
anticipated purchasing in excess of $20,000 during the fiscal year for
an item or group of similar items. Sealed bids are also required for a
public works (labor and materials) or services contract where the cost
exceeds $35,000 annually. A "public works contract" is defined as an
improvement to a public facility in which the majority of the costs are
labor. Any questions concerning whether items should be publicly bid
should be addressed to the attorneys for the Town.
C. Exceptions to sealed bidding would include:
(1) Purchases from New York State contracts and contracts let by
counties, cities, and towns within New York State.
(2) Purchases of prison-made goods under Correction Law §§ 184 and
186, as amended or changed.
(3) Purchases of products from preferred sources (State Finance Law
§ 162, as amended or changed).
(4) Emergency purchases as defined by General Municipal Law § 103,
as amended or changed.
(5) Purchases from a sole source.
(6) Professional services.
(7) True leases.
D. All legal requirements must be complied with, including, but not limited
to, General Municipal Law §§ 103 and 104-b, State Highway Law §§ 142
and 284, the State Finance Law and the Town Law, as amended or
changed.
§ 48-12 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 51-2
48:77
§ 51-2. Procurement of goods and services not requiring
competitive bidding; objectives.
Goods and services which are not required by law to be procured by the
Town pursuant to competitive bidding must be procured in a manner so
as to assure the prudent and economical use of public moneys in the
best interests of the taxpayers of the Town, to facilitate the acquisition
of goods and services of maximum quality at the lowest possible cost
under the circumstances and to guard against favoritism, improvidence,
extravagance, fraud and corruption. To further these objectives, the
governing board of the Town, by resolution, shall adopt internal policies and
procedures governing all procurements of goods and services which are not
required to be made pursuant to the competitive bidding requirements of
§ 103 of the General Municipal Law, as amended or changed, or of any other
general, special or local law.
§ 51-3. Purchasing code of ethics.
The Town Board of the Town of Irondequoit shall require adherence to the
following:
§ 51-4. Developing and implementing policies and procedures;
analysis of proposed procurement.
A. To consider first the interests of the Town of Irondequoit and the
improvement of its government.
B. To endeavor to obtain the greatest value for every dollar expended.
C. To strive for knowledge of municipal equipment and supplies in order to
recommend items that may either reduce cost or increase efficiency.
D. To insist on and expect honesty in sales representation whether offered
verbally or in writing, through advertising or in a sample of a product
submitted.
A. Section 104-b of the General Municipal Law, as amended or changed,
requires that the policies and procedures prescribe procedures for
determining whether a procurement is subject to competitive bidding,
and if it is not, documenting how the decision is reached. See
"Documenting Contract Awards for Non-Bid Procurement."12
B. The initial determination of whether competitive bidding is required
includes the following procedures:
(1) The Supervisor or Department Head seeking the procurement shall
determine whether it is expected that the political subdivision will
spend in excess of the competitive bidding thresholds for the same
or similar items or services (e.g., checking budgetary
appropriations and/or prior years' expenditures) over the course of

§ 51-5. Competitive bidding categories; exceptions to bidding
requirements.
the fiscal year. The Supervisor and Department Heads shall meet
periodically to ensure the objectives of this statute are met.
(2) The Supervisor or Department Head seeking the procurement shall
determine, as necessary or appropriate:
(a) Whether an item is available under New York State contracts
and contracts let by counties, cities, and towns within New
York State.
(b) In the case of an emergency, whether the statutory criteria (see
General Municipal Law § 103, Subdivision 4, as amended or
changed) are met.
(c) In the case of a lease, whether a document is a true lease and
not an installment purchase contract.
(d) In the case of a sole source, whether an item is required in the
public interest, has no reasonable equivalent and is in fact
available only from one source.
(e) In the case of a combination of professional services and a
purchase, for analyzing whether the professional service is the
predominant part of the transaction and is inextricably
integrated with the purchase.
A. Categories of procurements. This list identifies whether these
categories are subject to the competitive bidding requirements of § 103
of the General Municipal Law, as amended or changed, or the local
policies required by § 104-b.

B. Exceptions to competitive bidding requirements. The following is a
description of the various exceptions to the requirements of General
Municipal Law § 103:
(1) Preferred sources. Under State Finance Law § 162, as amended or
changed, all suitable products and services, as determined and
approved by the New York State Office of General Services, shall be
procured by any political subdivision in accordance with applicable
specifications of the political subdivision from qualified charitable
nonprofit agencies for the blind, qualified nonprofit agencies for
other severely handicapped, qualified special employment
programs for the mentally ill or veterans' workshops, which have
been approved by the Commissioner of Social Services, Education
or Mental Health, as the case may be, and which are organized
under the laws of New York State, and are manufacturing such
products or performing such services within the state, whenever
the products are available at a price determined by the Office of
General Services. Competitive bidding requirements are not
applicable to these purchases.
(2) Goods made in correctional institutions.
(a) Under Correction Law § 184, as amended or changed, the
Commissioner of Correctional Services is required to cause to
be manufactured by inmates in state correctional institutions
items as are required by the state and political subdivisions,
and to furnish these items at prices as shall be fixed and
determined, upon requisition. That section provides: "No
article so manufactured . . . shall be purchased from any other
source . . . unless the commissioner . . . shall certify that the
same cannot be furnished upon such requisition, and no claim
therefor shall be audited or paid without such certificate." See
also Correction Law § 186, as amended or changed.
(b) Since the Legislature has provided a purchasing requirement
for articles manufactured in correctional institutions which is
contrary to § 103 of the General Municipal Law, as amended or
changed, said section has no application to such purchases.
Under the Correction Law, a town may apply to the
Department of Correctional Services for a waiver which would
allow the town to make the purchase from other sources
pursuant to normal competitive bidding requirements. In
addition, a town may appeal the purchase price on the basis
that it unreasonably exceeds fair market price (Correction Law
§ 186, as amended or changed). For further information on this
program, political subdivisions may contact the Department of
Correctional Services, Division of Correctional Industries.
(3) State contracts. Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104, as
amended or changed, political subdivisions and districts therein
are authorized to make purchases, in excess of $500, of materials,
§ 51-5 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 51-5
48:81
equipment and supplies (except printed material) through the New
York State Office of General Services (OGS), subject to rules
established by OGS (see State Finance Law § 163). Section 104 of
the General Municipal Law provides that purchases by the town
through OGS are excepted from competitive bidding requirements.
A town may purchase numerous items at the same prices and
under the same terms and conditions as the state. Under § 104 of
the General Municipal Law, all purchases are subject to audit and
inspection by the political subdivision and the political subdivision
must accept sole responsibility for payment to the vendor. No
official may make a purchase through the OGS when bids have
already been received unless the purchase may be made upon the
same terms, conditions and specifications, but at a lower price,
through OGS.
(4) County, city, and town contracts. Pursuant to General Municipal
Law § 103, Subdivisions 3 and 16, as amended or changed,
purchases through any county, city, or town in New York State are
exempted from the competitive bidding requirements of General
Municipal Law, § 103 as amended or changed. As with purchases
through OGS, all purchases are subject to audit and inspection by
the Town, and the Town must accept sole responsibility for
payment to the vendor. No local official may make a purchase
through a county, city, or town when bids have already been
received unless the purchase may be made upon the same terms,
conditions and specifications, but at a lower price, through that
county, city, or town.
(5) Limitations on state, county, city, and town contracts.
(a) The exception for state, county, city, or town contract
purchases applies only when purchases are made from the
current state, county, city, or town vendor or in certain cases, a
listed agent or distributor, whose contract has been extended
to political subdivisions. Thus, the Town may not, as an
exception to bidding requirements, purchase from a vendor
other than a vendor holding a current state, county, city, or
town contract that has been extended to political subdivisions,
even if the purchase is equal to or below the state or county
price. For example, if a quote or bid were less than the state or
county contract price, the Town cannot simply accept that
lower price without going through the normal bid or quotation
process.
(b) Purchases from vendors holding state, county, city, or town
contracts may not be made upon terms and conditions which
materially or substantially vary from the state, county, city, or
town contract. Also, these exceptions relate to both purchase
contracts and contracts for public work.
§ 51-5 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 51-5
48:82
(c) Notwithstanding anything contrary under General Municipal
Law § 103(16), the exception from public bidding shall apply
only to New York State contracts and contracts let by towns,
cities, and counties in New York State.
(6) True leases.
(a) The courts have held that "true lease" agreements are neither
purchases nor contracts for public work and, thus, are not
subject to bidding under General Municipal Law § 103, as
amended or changed. Competitive bidding requirements may
not be avoided by simply casting an agreement, which is truly a
purchase or contract for public work, as a lease or rental.
(b) Although no one factor is determinative, the following factors
are to be considered when determining whether an agreement
is a true lease or an installment purchase contract:
[1] Transaction is a device intended to circumvent the
competitive bidding statutes;
[2] Intent to transfer title to Town, present or not;
[3] Town assumes indicia of ownership (i.e., risk of loss,
maintenance, repairs, insurance);
[4] Principle and interest component present in payment;
[5] Useful life of property involved;
[6] Acquisition of equity by Town during term of this
agreement;
[7] Fair market rental value;
[8] Value of option to purchase at end of the agreement; and/
or
[9] Total cost of payments in comparison to fair market value
of property at inception of contract.
(7) Insurance. The courts have held that insurance coverage is not
subject to formal competitive bidding.
(8) Emergencies.
(a) An exception to the competitive bidding requirements exists
for emergency situations (General Municipal Law § 103,
Subdivision 4, as amended or changed). The following are
three basic statutory criteria to be met in order to fall within
this exception:
[1] The situation arises out of an accident or other unforeseen
occurrence or condition.
§ 51-5 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 51-5
48:83
[2] The circumstances affect public buildings, public property
or the life, health, safety or property of the Town's
residents.
[3] The situation requires immediate action which cannot
await competitive bidding.
(b) Generally, there must be a present, immediate and existing
condition which is creating an imminent threat or danger and
which requires such immediate action that a further delay to
comply with competitive bidding requirements would be so
detrimental to the public interest that it overcomes the strong
public policy in favor of bidding. Because the emergency must
result from an accident or unforeseen occurrence, it is doubtful
the Town may invoke the emergency exception in a situation
which is the result of inaction or dilatory behavior on the part
of local officials and which, therefore, could have been
foreseen in time to advertise for bids. Even when the Town
Board passes a resolution that a public emergency exists, the
public interest dictates that purchases are made at the lowest
possible costs, seeking competition by informal solicitation of
quotes or otherwise, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances.
(9) Sole source.
(a) Competitive bidding is not required under § 103 of the General
Municipal Law, as amended or changed, in those limited
situations when a town, in the public interest, requires
particular goods or services which uniquely serve the public
interest, for which there is no substantial equivalent and which
are, in fact, available from only one good source (see gen. 1986
Opns St Comp No. 86-25, p. 41). Thus, for example, if the Town,
acting in good faith and without intent to arbitrarily inhibit or
restrict competition, determines that a particular patented
item is required in the public interest and it is further
determined that such item is available only from one source so
that no possibility of competition exists, competitive bidding
may not be required for the procurement of the item.
(b) In making these determinations, the Town should document,
among other things, the unique benefits of the item as
compared to other items available in the marketplace, that no
other item provides substantially equivalent or similar
benefits; and that, considering the benefits received, the cost
of the item is reasonable when compared to other products or
services in the marketplace. In addition, the Town should
document that, as matter of fact, there is no possibility of
competition for the procurement.
(10) Professional services.
§ 51-5 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 51-5
48:84
§ 51-6. Determination of procedure; documentation whether a
procurement is subject to competitive bidding.
(a) The courts have held that professional services are not
contracts for public work, as that phrase is used in the bidding
statutes, and, therefore, are not subject to competitive bidding
procedures. The determination of whether the professional
service exception is applicable in given situations must be
made on a case-by-case basis, examining the particular
services to be acquired.
(b) Generally, professional services involve specialized expertise,
use of professional judgment and/or a high degree of creativity.
Also, the services generally are to be performed by particular
designated individuals. Finally, the courts have noted that
professional service contracts often involve a relationship of
personal trust and confidence. Among the services which have
been held to be exempt from competitive bidding under this
exception are those of an engineer, architect, land surveyor,
attorney, physician and insurance broker.
(c) Generally, if the situation warrants a solicitation of costs, an
effective method would be a request for proposal (RFP). The
extent of the RFP would be decided on a case-by-case basis.
(11) Secondhand equipment from other governments. There is a
statutory exception to competitive bidding requirements which
permits the purchases of surplus and secondhand supplies,
materials or equipment without competitive bidding from the
federal or state government or from any other political or public
benefit corporation within the state (General Municipal Law, § 103,
Subdivision 6). However, purchases of used items from any other
source (e.g., private sources like auctions or going-out-of-business
sales) are not exempt from bidding requirements.
A. Analysis of proposed procurements. There must be a determination as
to whether a proposed procurement is subject to competitive bidding,
and if not, documenting how the decision is reached. Three initial
questions must be addressed: Is the proposed procurement a purchase
contract or a contract for public work? If it is either, is the amount
above the applicable threshold in § 103 of the General Municipal Law as
amended or changed? If so, do any exceptions apply? If it is not, what
type of procurement is it?
B. In general, purchase contracts involve the acquisition of commodities,
materials, supplies, or equipment, while contracts for public work
involve services, labor or construction. Each procurement must be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine which kind of purchase it
would be. If it would involve a substantial amount of service, to the
extent that the service provided to the Town is the focal point and the
acquisition of goods is incidental, then it would be considered a
§ 51-5 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 51-6
48:85
§ 51-7. Documentation required for purchase orders and contract
awards for non-bid procurements.
contract for public work. Conversely, if the service or labor is only
minimal or incidental to the acquisition of goods, it would be considered
a purchase contract.
C. For example, a contract for interior painting of a building involves both
material (paint) and labor (painting). In most instances, the labor
component of the contract will be predominant, making it a contract for
public work. In contrast, replacing a boiler furnace, while involving
both equipment (the boiler) and labor, will, in most instances, consist
primarily of a charge for the equipment, making it a purchase contract.
D. In documenting whether a proposed procurement is below the bidding
limits, records should include evidence of a written or verbal quotes
(telephone logs, etc.) to substantiate that the price of the item or
service would not exceed the bidding limits. In addition, since similar
procurements to be made in a fiscal year must be considered in the
aggregate for purposes of determining whether a particular item must
be bid, the responsible individual could document the amount expended
in previous years and that the monetary thresholds are not anticipated
to be exceeded in the current year, and therefore, bidding would not be
required. In this process, the amount anticipated to be spent in the
current year should be documented because the amount involved may
affect the method of competition to be sought. Documentation should
also explain how it was determined that the procurement was either a
purchase or a public works contract.
A. Verbal quotations. A telephone log or other record should provide, at a
minimum, the date, the item or service desired, the price quoted and
the name of the vendor's representative.
B. Written quotations. Vendors should provide, at a minimum, the date, a
description of the item or details of the service to be provided, the price
quoted, name of contract and signature. Quotes from websites are also
acceptable, provided that the relevant webpages are printed and kept
in Town files similar to written quotes provided by other vendors.
C. Procurements subject to § 104-b of the General Municipal Law are
listed in the following chart with policies and procedures:

D. Price documentation. Copies of the verbal quotation record or the
written quotation (with the above information) must be attached to
each purchase order as it is processed for ordering. Purchase orders
without this information will be returned to the ordering department. A
sample of the Town of Irondequoit Quotation Log is attached.13
A. In each of these situations, the following documentation should be
maintained to show that the procurement is in the best interest of the
local government and how that determination was made. Following are
suggested acceptable methods of documentation:
(1) Emergencies: Documentation should include a telephone log of
verbal quotes.
(2) True leases: Documentation should include written quotes, costbenefit
analysis of leasing versus purchasing, etc. Requests for
proposals may be used for obtaining true leases.
(3) Secondhand equipment from other governments: Documentation
should include market price comparisons (verbal or written quotes)
and name of government.
(4) Requests for proposals (hereinafter referred to as RFP): A request
for proposal and evaluation of proposals should consider quality of
service as well as price. Quality can be judged by factors such as
experience, staffing, ability to respond within the time constraints
established by the Town and suitability for the needs of the Town.
The award should be the most advantageous to the Town from all
perspectives, not only cost, but normally would include
negotiations of cost.
(a) A well-planned solicitation effort is needed to identify a
sufficient number of qualified firms. To locate qualified firms,
13.Editor's Note: Said log is on file in the Town offices.
§ 51-7 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 51-8
48:87
§ 51-9. Public bid instructions.
one might advertise in trade journals, check listings of
professionals, talk to other local officials, etc. Although many
firms may be active in a given locality, not all are likely to have
the specialized knowledge and experience needed to perform
a satisfactory service. A good solicitation effort helps to ensure
that these qualified firms are aware of the government's needs
and procurement procedures and are thereby able to
participate in the proposal process.
(b) A well-planned solicitation effort helps to encourage qualified
firms to respond to RFP's. Preparing a response to an RFP can
be costly. Qualified firms may be unwilling to go to the trouble
and expense of preparing a proposal if critical details of the
engagement or the method used to select (i.e., quality versus
price) are not made clear during the process.
(c) A well-planned solicitation effort can result in reduced costs
through increased competition. Of course, if not properly
managed, competition can produce unsatisfactory results. A
government may obtain a poor-quality service, for example, if
only cost factors are considered in the selection of a firm.
However, if a sufficient pool of qualified firms is identified
through a sound solicitation effort, governments can enjoy the
economic benefits of competition without sacrificing quality.
B. Depending on services obtained and specific circumstances,
procedures will necessarily vary. The specific steps to be followed
should be approved by the governing board. The documentation
maintained would include how firms were identified for solicitation, the
RFP, the criteria for evaluating proposals, the proposals for services
received from the various firms and any other relevant information.
C. Since there is no requirement in § 104-b of the General Municipal Law,
as amended or changed, on the frequency of solicitation, periodic
solicitation can be made at reasonable intervals. For example, a
professional could be selected with the option reserved by the local
government of extending the contract in succeeding years before
initiating another RFP process.
D. The following "Policy and Procedure for Securing Professional Services
for the Town of Irondequoit"14 is intended to provide guidance in
preparation of requests for proposals and the administration of the RFP
process.
A. The Town of Irondequoit operates in a decentralized purchasing
environment. Therefore, when a public bid is required it is coordinated

§ 51-10. Policy and procedure for securing professional services.
This policy and procedure shall be used by the Town of Irondequoit in the
procurement of professional services, including accounting/auditing, legal,
engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, planning, survey and
other like services; however, selection of expert witnesses and appraisers

shall be notified, and the Supervisor and Comptroller, together with the
head of the department that requires said professional service, shall
prepare a scope of services for the project or need of the Town that
requires such professional services.
B. At least three firms shall be solicited by the Town for consideration as
providers of the professional service. Factors to be considered in
determining which firms to solicit will be:
(1) The disciplines required by the project.
(2) The experience of the firm on a particular type of project and any
unique requirements of the project.
§ 51-9 POLICE DEPARTMENT § 51-10
48:89
(3) The quality of performance of the firm on previous work done for
the Town.
(4) The experience record of the firm on a particular type of project.
(5) Location of office and staff who will perform the work.
(6) Any other pertinent considerations as may be identified.
C. The Selection Committee shall consist of five voting members:
(1) The Town Supervisor.
(2) The Town Comptroller.
(3) The Town Attorney.
(4) The head of the department requiring the service.
(5) A Town Board liaison.
D. The Selection Committee shall determine by majority vote who will
write the request for proposal document.
E. Requests for proposals.
(1) A formal proposal on the descriptive scope of the project or
services sought shall be requested of the firms identified. The
solicitation of proposals will include the scope of the project or
services sought and a proposed schedule for completion or terms of
said professional relationship.
(2) The response to the proposal shall include discussion on the
proposed approach to the project or services required, any special
aspects of the project, schedule, staffing, projected budgets (if
applicable), any other information pertinent to executing the
project or services and a proposed fee schedule for such services.
F. Proposals shall be formally evaluated and ranked as to order of
preference by the Selection Committee. Interviews with each of the
firms submitting proposals shall be held prior to ranking, provided that
if more than three firms submit proposals, the Selection Committee
may provide a preliminary assessment of all proposals and elect to
interview no less than the top three firms. An evaluation memorandum
shall be prepared documenting the results of the evaluation and
reasons for the selected ranking.
G. When the ranking is completed, negotiations shall be held with the topranked
firm to establish detailed scope of such professional services, a
fair and reasonable fee for such professional services, and other terms
and conditions of the professional service agreement as may be
necessary given the nature of the project or services sought. In the
event that negotiations are not successful, the second-ranked firm shall
be invited to engage in a similar negotiation with the Committee; and
§ 51-10 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 51-10
48:90
§ 51-11. Alteration of policy.
A provision of the purchasing policies and provisions may be changed
by memorandum attached as an addition or deletion to the appropriate
provision by the Comptroller subject to the approval of the Town Board and
shall be added to the appendix herein.15
similarly the third-ranked firm shall be so engaged in a negotiation if an
agreement cannot be negotiated with the second.
H. In the event that the Selection Committee cannot recommend any of the
firms, the entire process as described above shall be reinitiated.
I. When negotiations are complete, the Selection Committee shall present
the scope of the professional services to be performed and the proposed
fee to the Town Board for approval.
J. Whenever practical, this process shall be used simultaneously when
more than one project of a similar type exists for which professional
services are required.
K. This procedure need not apply to services with an estimated cost of less
than $5,000. In such cases, the department proposing to utilize such
professional service shall review the qualifications of firms capable of
performing such professional service, negotiate the scope of such
professional service and the project work to be performed and establish
fees for such professional service.
L. The complete ranking sheet used by the Selection Committee shall be
made available for review in the office of the Town Clerk after the Town
Board has approved the contract with the consultant.
M. Upon completion of the professional services, the user department and
the Comptroller shall prepare an evaluation of the professional services
with particular attention to outstanding or unsatisfactory performance.
This evaluation shall be reviewed with the professional service provider,
modified by the professional service provider's input, if appropriate,
and submitted to and retained by the Selection Committee for its
information and consideration in making future determinations and
selections.
N. This procedure is considered fair and effective in ensuring quality
services at a fair, reasonable and controlled cost both to the Town of
Irondequoit and the professional service provider the Town retains.

determination. If the IPD suspends or revokes a hunter's ability to
participate in the program under this section, the hunter may appeal
the decision to the DMPB, pursuant to § 93-2N.

and/or the Building Inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that
work on any building or structure is proceeding without a permit or is
otherwise in violation of the provisions of any applicable law, code,

provisions of the application, plans or specifications on the basis of
which a permit was issued or is being conducted in an unsafe and
dangerous manner, he or she shall notify either the owner of the
property or the owner's agent or the person, firm or corporation
performing the work to immediately suspend all work. In such instance,
any and all persons shall immediately suspend all related activities until
the stop-work order has been duly rescinded. Posting of a stop-work

A. Well-maintained properties play a significant role in defining
Irondequoit's quality of life and influencing property values. Therefore,
building conditions require vigilant oversight. The Town is compelled to
take all available measures to minimize potential negative impacts
associated with vacant and/or unsafe buildings.
B. The Town Board finds that vacant buildings, if not managed effectively,
can become unsightly and unsafe and have a negative effect on the
community. Unsafe buildings pose a threat to life and property in the
Town of Irondequoit. Buildings and structures may become unsafe by
reason of fire, explosion, or are so damaged, decayed or dilapidated, or
by the elements, age or general deterioration. Vacant and/or unsafe
buildings not properly secured at doorways and windows also serve as
an attractive nuisance for young children, who may be injured therein,
as well as a point of congregation by vagrants and transients. A vacant
or dilapidated building may also serve as a place of rodent infestation,
thereby creating a health menace to the community.
C. It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure the safety, health, protection
and general welfare of persons and property in the Town of Irondequoit
by addressing vacant and unsafe properties. This chapter establishes a
process for identifying and registering vacant buildings that sets forth
the responsibilities of owners and/or operators of vacant buildings and
expedites the rehabilitation of vacant buildings. This chapter also
describes the process and requirements by which unsafe buildings shall
be repaired or demolished and removed.

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM
§ 115-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Community Choice Aggregation Local
Law of the Town of Irondequoit."
§ 115-2. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
§ 115-3. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, and unless otherwise expressly stated or
unless the context otherwise requires, the terms in this chapter shall have
A. It is the policy of both the Town of Irondequoit ("Municipality") and the
State of New York to reduce costs and provide price certainty for the
purpose of consumer protection and economic development, to expand
access and opportunities for consumers in retail energy markets, as
well as to promote the sustainability and resilience of energy systems
through the proliferation of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
distributed energy resources (DER, as defined below). Among the
initiatives that may advance these objectives in New York is community
choice aggregation ("CCA"), a policy that empowers local governments
to determine the source of electricity and/or natural gas supply on
behalf of its residents and small businesses, reflecting local resources,
priorities, and challenges. Energy delivery remains the responsibility of
the distribution utility.
B. This chapter establishes the authority for the Town of Irondequoit, in
connection with the implementation of a CCA program, to acquire
utility data, to select, through competitive solicitation, energy
supplier(s) on behalf of participating consumers within the
jurisdictional boundaries of the Town of Irondequoit, and to maximize
value for participating consumers through enhanced services related to
DER. The Municipality may choose to collaborate with other local
governments to form an intermunicipal program. As a result,
consumers will have the opportunity to lower and stabilize their energy
costs, to spur local clean energy innovation and investment, and to
reduce their environmental impact; thereby, fulfilling the purposes of
this chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.
C. The Town of Irondequoit is authorized to implement this community
choice aggregation program pursuant to § 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New
York Municipal Home Rule Law; and consistent with State of New York
Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion
of the Commission to Enable community choice aggregation programs
(issued April 21, 2016), as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0224, to the extent that orders related to Case
No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the Municipality.
§ 110-9 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 115-3
110:210
the meanings employed in the State of New York Public Service
Commission's Uniform Business Practices or, if not so defined there, as
indicated below:
AGGREGATED DATA  Aggregated and anonymized information, including,
but not limited to, the number of consumers by service and rate class,

Administrator, duly authorized to request aggregated and customer-specific
data, competitively solicit suppliers for the aggregated demand for
electricity and/or natural gas on behalf of default consumers, and to offer
participating consumers additional opportunities to participate or enroll
in programs or projects related to distribued energy resources. The CCA
Administrator is responsible for program organization, administration,
procurement, communications, and for meeting all requirements for
program implementation specified in the PSC CCA order, unless otherwise
specified. The CCA Administrator shall be designated by the Town Board of
the Municipality.

DEFAULT CONSUMERS  Customers of electricity and/or natural gas
within opt-out eligible service classes (as delineated in the PSC CCA order),
who receive supply service from the distribution utility as of the date
the supply contract goes into effect, or consumers within these service
classes that subsequently become eligible to participate in the program,
including those that have terminated a supply contract with an ESCO,
removed a freeze or block on their account, have voluntarily suspended
service pursuant to a special rate, or are new residents of the Municipality.
Consumers within opt-out-eligible service classes, as of the date the supply
contract goes into effect, taking service from an ESCO, those that have
placed a freeze or block on their account, and those for whom enrollment in
the CCA program would interfere with a choice they have already made to
take service pursuant to a special rate are not considered default consumers
and will not be enrolled on an opt-out basis. For the avoidance of doubt,
all default consumers must reside or be otherwise located at one or more
locations within the geographic boundaries of the Municipality, as such
boundaries exist as of the date the supply contract goes into effect.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION or PSC  New York State Public Service
Commission.
SUPPLIER  An ESCO that procures electric power and natural gas for
participating consumers in connection with this chapter or, alternatively,

A. A community choice aggregation program is hereby authorized by the
Municipality, whereby the Municipality may implement a CCA program
to the full extent permitted by the PSC CCA order, as set forth more
fully herein.
B. The Municipality may enter into contracts with one or more suppliers
for electric and/or natural gas supply and other services on behalf of

ESCOs provide energy services, and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
A. All default consumers shall be enrolled on an opt-out basis. Default
consumers will have the right to opt out before the supply contract goes
into effect, or disenroll any time thereafter with no penalty. Those that
do not opt out before the supply contract goes into effect will be
enrolled automatically.
B. All nondefault consumers within the Municipality, regardless of service
class, shall be eligible to participate in the CCA program on an opt-in
basis at any time.
C. CCA Administrator, on behalf of the Town of Irondequoit, shall issue

procedures for opting-out of and opting-in to the CCA program. The
letter shall explain that default consumers that do not opt-out will be
enrolled in the program under the contract terms and that information
on those consumers, including energy usage data and APP status, will
be provided to the ESCO. The letter will also explain how nondefault
consumers can opt in to the program and how default consumers who
have opted out can later opt in to the program.
B. All consumers shall have the option to opt out of the CCA program at
any time without penalty or any other administrative or other fee or
charge.
A. The Municipality, or CCA Administrator on its behalf, may request

home shall be granted unless the applicant therefor shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Town Board that there exists a reasonable certain
source of continuous and sufficient funds to provide for the operation
and maintenance of such facility in accordance with the representations
of the application and various standards applicable to such facility by
reason of this chapter and other laws and regulations.
A. A letter should be sent by the applicant to the neighbors announcing
the intention to establish a community residence or group home and

applicant, fees will reflect actual expenses of reviewing it and for
the publication of notices. When the EIS is prepared by an agency
on behalf of the applicant, fees will reflect the cost of preparation,
including publication of notices, but not the cost of environmental
review by the agency. However, the lead agency may not charge a
fee for its determination of significance.
C. Decisions and findings for actions subject to EIS's. Decisionmaking and
findings for any proposed action which is the subject of a final EIS shall
be made by the agency of the town contemplating such action in
accordance with the provisions of 6 NYCRR 617.9, as amended or
changed, and §§ 123-12 and 123-13 of this chapter, regardless of
whether or not it is the lead agency.

§ 123-13. Consistency. [Amended 12-15-1998 by L.L. No. 8-1998]
A. Whenever a proposed action is located in the LWA, the lead agency shall
make a determination that it is consistent to the maximum extent
practicable with the LWRP policy standards and conditions set forth in
Subsection E. No action shall be approved, funded or undertaken
without this determination.
B. Prior to making the determination of consistency, the lead agency shall
solicit and consider the recommendation of the Department of Planning
and Zoning with the reference to the consistency of the proposed
action. The lead agency shall make the determination of consistency
based on the EAF, the CAF, the Department of Planning and Zoning

maximum extent practicable with LWRP policy standards and
conditions or to advance them to a greater degree. In the event that the
Department of Planning and Zoning's recommendation is not
forthcoming within the specified time, the applicant shall be deemed to
have received a recommendation that it is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable.
§ 123-12 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 123-13
123:225
E. Actions to be undertaken within the LWA shall be evaluated for
consistency in accordance with the following LWRP policy standards
and conditions, which are from and further explained and described in
Section III of the Town of Irondequoit LWRP, a copy of which is on file in
the Town Clerk's office and available for inspection during normal
business hours. Agencies which directly undertake actions shall also
consult with Section IV of the LWRP in making their consistency
determination. The action shall be consistent with the policy to:
(1) Restore, revitalize and redevelop deteriorated and underutilized
waterfront areas for commercial and cultural, recreational and
other compatible uses (Policy 1 and Subpolicies 1A through 1H).
(2) Facilitate the siting of water-dependent uses and facilities on or
adjacent to coastal waters (Policy 2 and Subpolicies 2A through
2C).
(3) Strengthen the economic base of small harbor areas by
encouraging the development and enhancement of those
traditional uses and activities which have provided such areas with
unique maritime identity (Policy 4 and Subpolicies 4A and 4B).
(4) Encourage the location of development in areas where public
services and facilities essential to such development are adequate,
except when such development has special functional requirements
or other characteristics which necessitate its location in other
coastal areas (Policy 5 and Subpolicies 5A and 5B).
(5) Expedite permit procedures in order to facilitate the siting of
development activities at suitable locations (Policy 6).
(6) Protect, preserve and, where practical, restore significant coastal
fish and wildlife habitats, as identified on the coastal area map, so
as to maintain their viability as habitats (Policy 7 and Subpolicy
7A).
(7) Protect fish and wildlife resources in the coastal area from the
introductions of hazardous wastes and pollutants which
bioaccumulate in the food chain or which cause significant
sublethal or lethal effects on those resources (Policy 8).
(8) Expand recreational use of fish and wildlife resources in coastal
areas by increasing access to existing resources, supplementing
existing stocks and developing new resources. Such effects shall be
made in a manner which ensures the protection of renewable fish
and wildlife resources and considers other activities dependent on
them (Policy 9 and Subpolicy 9B).
(9) Site buildings and other structures in the coastal area so as to
minimize damage to property and the endangering of human life
caused by flooding and erosion (Policy 11 and Subpolicies 11A
through 11C).
§ 123-13 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 123-13
123:226
(10) Undertake activities or development in the coastal area so as to
minimize damage to natural resources and property from flooding
and erosion by protecting natural protective features, including
beaches, dunes and bluffs. Primary dunes will be protected from all
encroachments that could impair their natural protective capacity
(Policy 12 and Subpolicies 12A through 12C).
(11) Undertake the construction or reconstruction of erosion structures
only if they have a reasonable probability of controlling erosion for
at least 30 years as demonstrated in design and construction
standards and/or assured maintenance or replacement programs
(Policy 13).
(12) Undertake activities and development, including the construction
or reconstruction of erosion-protection structures, so that there
will be no measurable increase in erosion or flooding at the site of
such activities or development or at other locations (Policy 14).
(13) Mine, excavate or dredge in coastal water so as to not interfere
with the natural coastal processes which supply beach materials to
land adjacent to such waters and shall be undertaken in a manner
which will not cause an increase in erosion of such land (Policy 15).
(14) Use public funds only for erosion-protective structures where
necessary to protect human life and new development which
requires a location within or adjacent to an erosion-hazard area to
be able to function or existing development; and only where the
public benefits outweigh the long-term monetary and other costs,
including the potential for increasing erosion and adverse effects
on natural protective features (Policy 16 and Subpolicy 16A).
(15) Use, whenever possible, nonstructural measures to minimize
damage of natural resources and property from flooding and
erosion. Such measures shall include:
(a) The setback of buildings and structures.
(b) The planting of vegetation and the installation of sand fencing
and draining.
(c) The reshaping of bluffs.
(d) The floodproofing of buildings or their elevation above the base
flood level. (Policy 17 and Subpolicies 17A through 17C).
(16) Safeguard the vital economic, social and environmental interests of
the state and of its citizens; proposed major actions in the coastal
area must give full consideration to those interests and to the
safeguards which the state has established to protect valuable
coastal resources (Policy 18).
(17) Protect, maintain and increase the level and types of access to
public water-related recreation resources and facilities so that
§ 123-13 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 123-13
123:227
these resources and facilities may be fully utilized by all the public
in accordance with reasonably anticipated public recreation needs
and the protection of historic and natural resources. In providing
such access, priority will be given to public beaches, boating
facilities, fishing area and waterfront parks (Policy 19 and
Subpolicies 19A and 19B).
(18) Provide access to the publicly owned foreshore and to land
immediately adjacent to the foreshore or the water's edge that are
publicly owned in a manner compatible with adjoining uses. Such
lands shall be retained in public ownership (Policy 20 and
Subpolicies 20A through 20C).
(19) Encourage, facilitate and give priority to water-dependent and
water-enhanced recreation uses over non-water-related uses along
the coast, provided that it is consistent with the preservation and
enhancement of other coastal resources and takes into account
demand for such facilities. In facilitating such activities, priority
shall be given to areas where access to the recreation opportunities
of the coast can be provided by new or existing public
transportation services and to the areas where the use of the shore
is severely restricted by existing development (Policy 21 and
Subpolicies 21A through 21D).
(20) Assure development, when located adjacent to the shore, will
provide water-related recreation as a multiple use whenever such
use is compatible with reasonably anticipated demand for such
activities and the primary purpose of the development (Policy 22
and Subpolicies 22A and 22B).
(21) Protect, enhance and restore structures, districts, areas or sites
that are of significance in the history, architecture, archaeology or
culture of the state, its communities or the nation (Policy 23 and
Subpolicy 23A).
(22) Protect, restore or enhance natural and man-made resources which
are not identified as being of statewide significance, but which
contribute to the overall scenic quality of the coastal area (Policy
25 and Subpolicies 25A and 25B).
(23) Assure ice-management practices shall not damage significant fish
and wildlife and their habitats, increase shoreline erosion or
flooding or interfere with the production of hydroelectric power
(Policy 28).
(24) Assure that municipal, industrial and commercial discharge of
pollutants, including but not limited to toxic and hazardous
substances, into coastal waters conform to state and national water
quality standards (Policy 30 and Subpolicies 30A and 30B).
(25) Consider state coastal area policies and management objectives of
approved local waterfront revitalization programs while reviewing
§ 123-13 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 123-13
123:228
coastal water classifications and while modifying water quality
standards; however, those waters already overburdened with
contaminants will be recognized as being a development constraint
(Policy 31).
(26) Use best management practices to ensure the control of
stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows draining into
coastal waters (Policy 33 and Subpolicy 34 and 33A).
(27) Limit the discharge of waste materials into coastal waters from
vessels so as to protect significant fish and wildlife habitats,
recreational areas and water supply areas (Policy 34 and Subpolicy
34A).
(28) Undertake dredging and dredge spoil disposal in coastal waters in
a manner that meets existing state dredging permit requirements
and protects significant fish and wildlife habitats, scenic resources,
natural protective features, important agricultural lands and
wetlands (Policy 35).
(29) Conduct activities related to the shipment and storage of
petroleum and other hazardous materials in a manner that will
prevent or at least minimize spills into coastal waters; all
practicable efforts will be undertaken to expedite the cleanup of
such discharges; and restitution for damages will be required when
these spills occur (Policy 36).
(30) Use best management practices to minimize the nonpoint
discharge of excess nutrients, organics and eroded soils into
coastal waters (Policy 37).
(31) Conserve and protect the quality and quantity of surface water and
groundwater supplies, particularly where such waters constitute
the primary or sole source of water supply (Policy 38).
(32) Conduct the transport, storage, treatment and disposal of solid
wastes, particularly hazardous wastes, within coastal areas in such
a manner so as to protect groundwater and surface water supplies,
significant fish and wildlife habitats, recreation areas, important
recreation areas, important agricultural lands and scenic resources
(Policy 39).
(33) Ensure that land use or development in the coastal area will not
cause national or state air quality standards to be violated (Policy
41).
(34) Consider coastal management policies if the state reclassifies land
areas pursuant to the prevention of significant deterioration
regulations of the Federal Clean Air Act (Policy 42).
(35) Preserve and protect tidal and freshwater wetlands and preserve
the benefits derived from these areas (Policy 44).

Findings, Purpose and Objectives
§ 136-1. Findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Irondequoit finds that the potential and/
or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Town of Irondequoit and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.

The objectives of this chapter are to:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages;
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.

§ 136-4. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. As used
in this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one foot to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base
floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain." For purposes of this chapter,
the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with
the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor, 18
inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside of the
lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area, which
may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must be equal to or above
the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be
properly vented to allow for the equalization of hydrostatic forces which
would be experienced during periods of flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.

that administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)  An official map of the
community published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as
part of a riverine community's Flood Insurance Study. The FBFM delineates
a regulatory floodway along watercourses studied in detail in the Flood
Insurance Study.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water
surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of
flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as
Zone A but no flood elevations are provided.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  An official map of a community,
on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both
the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to
the community.

Administration
§ 136-11. Designation of local administrator.
The Director of Community Development is hereby appointed local
administrator to administer and implement this chapter by granting or
denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 136-12. Floodplain development permit.
§ 136-13. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 136-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures,
fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $50. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Town of Irondequoit for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this
project, including, but not limited to, the legal fees incurred by the
Town. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$1,000 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permitee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permitee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
§ 136-11 FIREARMS § 136-13
132:243
§ 136-14. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 136-16C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 136-18, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 136-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 136-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 136-15A, Subdivision proposals.
§ 136-13 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 136-14
132:244
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 136-13G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meets the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of evidence
of such notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
§ 136-14 FIREARMS § 136-14
132:245
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator may review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
by the local administrator shall be cause to issue a stop-work order
for the project unless immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect may make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 136-9 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter, any other applicable law and/or
the conditions of the development permit. Disregard of a stop-work
order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 136-9
of this chapter.

§ 136-20. Appeals Board.
A. The Planning Board as established by the Town of Irondequoit shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Planning Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Board may appeal such
decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Planning Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search-and-rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 136-20 FIREARMS § 136-20
132:255
§ 136-21. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search-and-rescue operations and
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 136-20D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Planning Board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 136-20D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 136-20 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 136-21
132:256
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing chapters or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
$25 for $100 of insurance coverage and such construction below the
base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification
shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required
in § 136-14H of this chapter.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL  Full- and/or part-time employees of
the Department of Community Development, including the Director of
Community Development, Building Inspector, Fire Marshal, Code
Enforcement Officer, or others designated by the Director of Community
Development.
DEPARTMENT  The Department of Community Development.
A. Residential properties are significant assets and a critical investment in
the Town of Irondequoit because of their impact on community
character, property values and overall quality of life. To maintain our
neighborhoods and facilitate effective code enforcement, the Town
must be able to efficiently communicate with property owners
regarding maintenance and property conditions.
B. In instances when residential properties are rented, the Town Board
has determined that accurate and current contact information is
needed to facilitate timely communication with property owners
regarding potential issues related to property conditions and/or
violations of the Town Code and/or the laws of the State of New York.
The Town Board has also determined that the inability to make timely
contact with the owners of such residential rental properties may result
in extended physical deterioration of housing stock and/or substandard
living conditions for Town residents. The Town Board finds that
establishing registration requirements for rental properties is in the
best interest of public health, safety, and welfare and the good order
and governance of the Town will be promoted and enhanced by the
enactment of registration requirements for such rental properties and
their owners through the enactment of the provisions set forth in this
chapter.

As used in this article, unless the context or subject matter otherwise
requires, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ADMINISTRATOR  The Solid Waste Administrator of Monroe County.
A. The Congress of the United States has mandated resource recovery as a
component of solid waste management and to that end has enacted the
National Resource Recovery Act of 1989 which mandates recycling as a
method of resource recovery. The New York State Legislature has
followed the federal mandate in enacting the New York State Solid
Waste Management Act of 1988 which requires recycling of waste
materials as a component of the New York State Solid Waste
Management Law and requires that municipalities adopt a local law or
ordinance to require that solid waste which has been left for collection
or which is delivered by the generator of such waste to a solid waste
management facility shall be separated into recyclable, reusable or
other components for which economic markets for alternate uses exist.
As mandated by the New York State Solid Waste Management Act of
1988, the County of Monroe has enacted Local Law No. 4-1991, entitled
"Solid Waste Reuse and Recycling Law," which requires, among other
things, that each municipality within Monroe County enact a mandatory
recycling ordinance or local law.
B. The purpose of this article is to comply with the mandate of the federal,
state and county governments for the management, on a town-wide
basis, of all solid waste generated within the Town of Irondequoit and to
authorize the supervision and regulation of the storage, collection and
disposition of all or part of any solid waste generated within the Town of
Irondequoit, emphasizing the source reduction, recovery and recycling
of certain materials in the waste stream. [Amended 7-20-1999 by
L.L. No. 5-1999]
C. Therefore, the Town of Irondequoit, with suggestions from the Solid
Waste Management Commission, will continue to investigate solutions

ARTICLE I
Pollution Prevention and Erosion and Sediment Control During
Construction
[Adopted 12-18-2007 by L.L. No. 9-2007]
§ 196-1. Title.
This Article I of this Chapter 196 shall be known as and may be cited as the
"Construction Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Erosion and Sediment
Control Law of the Town of Irondequoit of 2007."
§ 196-2. Introduction and purpose.
A. Land disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. During the construction process, soil is the most vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for
fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates
maintenance and/or repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of
waterways. In addition, clearing and/or grading during construction
tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to provide a healthy
living environment for citizens of the Town of Irondequoit. Improper
design and construction of stormwater management practices can
increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing
streambank erosion and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less
water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater
recharge and stream base flow. Regulation of land disturbance
activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater
management and site design will produce development compatible with
the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and
thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from
development.
C. As a result, the purpose of this article is to safeguard public health,
protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the
public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design,
construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other
activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement
of earth on land in the Town of Irondequoit. It seeks to meet those
purposes by achieving the following objectives:

B. Property owner/developer inspections.
(1) The applicant shall employ a "responsible individual," as defined in
§ 196-3 who will oversee the implementation of the SWPPP on a
daily basis. The responsible individual shall be on site at all times
when construction or grading activity takes place and shall inspect
and document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control
practices. The applicant shall also employ the services of a
qualified professional in erosion and sediment control who will
inspect and document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment
control practices. The documentation will be kept in a site logbook.
Inspection reports will be completed every seven days and within
24 hours of any storm event producing 0.5 inch of precipitation or
more. A monthly summary of reports will be copied to the site
logbook and delivered to the Town of Irondequoit within five days
after the month's end.
(2) The requirement to employ a qualified professional to inspect and
document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control
practices is not applicable to land disturbance activities of five
acres or less occurring on a single-family residence, which is not
part of a larger common plan of development or on an agricultural
property. In addition, these land disturbance activities must not
discharge directly to a 303(d) impaired water body or must not be
located in a total maximum daily load (TMDL) watershed.

194:425
A. Duration.
(1) For a project that requires a NYSDEC SPDES permit, the SWPPP
approved by the Town of Irondequoit shall be in effect until:
(a) The site has been finally stabilized;
(b) A notice of termination (NOT) is submitted to the NYSDEC in
accordance with the general permit; and
(c) A final inspection has been completed by the Town of
Irondequoit.
(2) For projects that do not require an NYSDEC NOT, the SWPPP is in
effect until a final inspection is conducted and the Town of
Irondequoit has issued the applicant written approval.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no land disturbance
activity, as defined in § 196-3, takes place within two years
following the date upon which the Town's approval of the SWPPP
was issued, no development activity or work of any kind may take
place until such time, if any, as the Town's Stormwater
Management Officer reviews and confirms its previous approval of
the SWPPP. The Town shall establish a fee for such review and
confirmation in accordance with the provisions of § 196-15.
B. Maintenance.
(1) The applicant shall at all times properly operate and maintain all
stormwater management facilities and erosion and sediment
control measures which are installed or used by the applicant to
achieve compliance with the conditions of this chapter. Sediment
shall be removed from sediment traps or sediment ponds whenever
their design capacity has been reduced by 50%. The land
disturbance activity shall not cause an increase in turbidity that
will result in substantial visible contrast to natural conditions in
surface waters of the State of New York.
(2) At the end of the construction season when soil disturbance
activities will be finalized or suspended until the following spring, it
may be desirable to reduce the frequency of the required weekly
site inspections to monthly inspections. In order to reduce
inspection frequencies, the applicant must complete stabilization
activities before proper installation is precluded by snow cover or
frozen ground. If vegetation is used as a stabilization method,
seeding, planting, and/or sodding must be scheduled to avoid fall
frosts and to allow for proper germination/establishment.
Installations and maintenance must be done according to the New
York State Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment
Control.
§ 196-12 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 196-12
194:426
(3) The maintenance and proper operation of all privately owned
stormwater management facilities, including nonstructural
practices, shall be ensured through the creation of a formal and
enforceable maintenance agreement that must be approved by the
Town of Irondequoit and recorded in the office of the County Clerk
as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan approval.
This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements
required to access and inspect the stormwater management
practices, and will outline the procedures and schedule to be
followed to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure
proper functioning of the stormwater management practice. In
addition, the legally binding agreement shall identify the parties
responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater
treatment practices and include plans for periodic inspections by
the owners, or their designated agent, to ensure proper
performance of the facility. The maintenance agreement shall be
generally consistent with the terms and conditions of the
"Stormwater Control Facility Maintenance Agreement," the form of
which is attached to and made a part of this chapter as Exhibit A.62
(4) The Town of Irondequoit, in lieu of a maintenance agreement, may
accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater
management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets
all the requirements of this chapter and includes adequate and
perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for
inspection and regular maintenance.
C. Closeout. The applicant must satisfy the following project closeout
requirements:
(1) Reestablish grade of all permanent stormwater facilities.
(2) Inspect grading of all drainage structures and provide elevation asbuilts
to the Town of Irondequoit.
(3) Establish perennial vegetative cover to a density of 80% over 100%
of the site.
(4) Removal of all debris and temporary erosion and sediment control
practices.
(5) Provide a written certification by a New York State licensed/
certified professional that the site has undergone final stabilization
(as defined in § 196-3) and that all temporary erosion and sediment
controls not needed for long-term erosion control have been
removed.
(6) Complete any other measure deemed appropriate and necessary by
the Town of Irondequoit to stabilize the project site.

B. Simultaneous with the filing of an application and prior to the
commencement of any construction or site work activities, the
applicant shall deposit with the Town Supervisor a sum of money
determined by the Town Board to cover the costs to be incurred by the
Town for engineering, inspection and legal expenses. Such deposit shall
be held in a separate, non-interest-bearing account in the name of the
Town, and the Town Supervisor shall keep a separate record of all such
moneys deposited, on whose behalf the moneys were deposited, and the
project for which the sums were deposited.
C. Upon receipt and approval by the Town Board of itemized vouchers
from an engineer and/or attorney for services rendered on behalf of the
Town pertaining to the application, construction or site work activities,
the Town Supervisor shall cause such vouchers to be paid out of the

194:429
moneys so deposited and shall furnish copies of such vouchers to the
applicant at the same time such vouchers are submitted to the Town.
D. The Town Board shall review and audit all such vouchers and shall
approve payment of only such engineering and legal fees which the
Town Board determined to have been reasonable and necessarily
incurred by the Town in connection with the review, consideration and
approval of any application. For purposes of the foregoing, a fee or part
thereof is reasonable in amount if it bears a reasonable relationship to
the average charge by engineers or attorneys to the Town for services
performed in connection with the approval or construction of a similar
development. In this regard, the Town Board may take into
consideration, among other things, the size, type and number of
facilities and of the construction and/or site work activities to be
performed; the topography of the land on which such construction and/
or site work activities are to be conducted and/or facilities to be
located; soil conditions; surface water drainage conditions; the nature
and extent of facilities to be constructed; and any special conditions or
considerations that the Town Board may deem relevant. A fee or part
thereof is necessarily incurred if it was charged by the engineer or
attorney for a service which was rendered in order to protect the
health, safety or other vital interests of the residents of the Town or to
protect public or private property from damage and other factors, to
assure the proper and timely implementation of the purposes and
provisions of this article, to protect the legal interests of the Town,
including, but not limited to, the avoidance of claims and liability, and
such other interests as the Town Board may deem relevant.
E. If at any time during or after the processing of such application or
during or after construction or site work activities there shall be
insufficient moneys on hand to the credit of the applicant to pay the
approved vouchers in full, or if it shall reasonably appear to the Town
Supervisor that such moneys will be insufficient to meet vouchers yet to
be submitted, the Town Supervisor shall cause the applicant to deposit
additional sums as the Supervisor deems necessary or advisable to
meet such expenses or anticipated expenses.
F. In the event that the applicant fails to deposit such funds or such
additional funds, the Town Supervisor shall notify any and all applicable
Town officers and boards of such failure, and any review, approval,
permit or certificate may be withheld by such appropriate officer and/or
board until such moneys are deposited.
G. The issuance of any final approval, permit or certificate of occupancy
shall not occur unless and until all fees incurred by the Town have been
paid in full. Any amounts remaining on account to the credit of the
applicant after such final approval, permit or certificate shall be
returned to such applicant.

ARTICLE II
Design and Management of Postconstruction Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Measures
[Adopted 12-18-2007 by L.L. No. 7-2007]
§ 196-16. Title.
This Article II of this Chapter 196 shall be known as and may be cited
as the "Design and Management of Postconstruction Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Measures Law of the Town of Irondequoit of 2007."
§ 196-17. Introduction and purpose.
§ 196-18. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  The activity of an active farm, including
grazing and watering livestock, irrigating crops, harvesting crops, using
land for growing agricultural products, and cutting timber for sale, but
shall not include the operation of a dude ranch or similar operation, or the
construction of new structures associated with agricultural activities.
A. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the
watersheds within the Town of Irondequoit. Therefore, the Town of
Irondequoit establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies to
provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff
and to, in addition to the above, safeguard persons, protect property,
prevent damage to the environment in the Town of Irondequoit, and
comply with the NYSDEC State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal
separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the
regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
projects and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution
associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.

considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this
article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by this
chapter or any other chapter of this Code, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose
higher protective standards for human health and/or the environment
shall be considered to take precedence.
B. Construction activities that involve land disturbance may also require
additional compliance measures detailed in other articles of this
chapter, other chapters of the Code and/or regulations.
§ 196-19 SPECIAL EVENTS § 196-21
194:435
§ 196-21. Legislative authority.

By the same authority, the Irondequoit Town Board may include in any such
law provisions for the appointment of any municipal employees to effectuate
and administer such law.
§ 196-22. Compliance.
§ 196-23. Waivers and mitigation requirements.
A. No person(s) shall receive any of the building, grading or other land
disturbance approvals or permits required for land disturbance
activities without first meeting the requirements of this article to the
satisfaction of the Town of Irondequoit.
B. Unless specifically excluded by this article, any landowner or operator
desiring approval or a permit for a land disturbance activity shall
comply with all applicable provisions of this article and shall submit all
required plans, documentation and information as required under this
article to the Town of Irondequoit for review and approval.
C. Unless otherwise accepted by this article, the following items shall be
submitted prior to the issuance of a permit or site plan approval:
(1) Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (see § 196-26).
(2) Maintenance easement(s) (see § 196-27).
(3) Maintenance agreement(s) (see § 196-27).
(4) Any applicable fees (see § 196-33).
D. The SWPPP shall be prepared to meet the requirements of §§ 196-25
through 196-27. The maintenance agreement shall be prepared to meet
the requirements of § 196-27, and applicable fees shall be those as set
fourth in § 196-33.
E. The SWPPP and all other documents required by this article must be
reviewed by the Town of Irondequoit to ensure that established water
quality standards will be maintained after development of the site and
that postconstruction runoff levels are consistent with any local and
regional watershed plans. Information shall be submitted as a single,
logical package, with all information bound together.
A. All person(s) shall comply with the requirements of this article, unless a
written request is filed to waive the requirements in part or whole for
land disturbance activities that disturb less than one acre of land.
Requests to waive any requirements of this article shall be submitted to
the Town of Irondequoit for approval.
§ 196-21 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 196-23
194:436
B. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be
waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant,
provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
(1) It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
(2) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater
pollution prevention plan that has been approved by the Town of
Irondequoit, and the implementation of the plan is required by local
law. These practices are encouraged in order to minimize the
reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in
the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned
through the use of nonstructural practices that reduce the
generation of stormwater from the site. These nonstructural
practices are explained in detail in the manual Better Site Design:
A Handbook for Changing Development Rules in Your Community.
Applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural
practices must ensure that these practices are documented and
remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.
(3) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site
practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for
long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice.
(4) The Town of Irondequoit finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site.
(5) Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce a) the
generation of stormwater from the site, b) the size and cost of
stormwater storage and c) the pollutants generated at the site.
C. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Town of
Irondequoit may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these
stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the
applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Town of
Irondequoit that the variance will not result in the following impacts to
downstream waterways:
(1) Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures.
(2) Degradation of biological functions or habitat.
(3) Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation.

(4) Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
D. Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the
minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures
selected by the Town of Irondequoit. Mitigation measures may include,
but are not limited to, the following:
(1) The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation
(see § 196-24B, Dedication or easement of land, below). These
lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to
provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and
aquatic habitat;
(2) The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public
or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities
designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and
standards of this chapter; and
(3) Monetary contributions (see § 196-24A, Fee in lieu of, below) to a
dedicated fund for stormwater management activities.
E. No waivers or mitigation plans will be considered for land disturbance
activity that disturbs one acre or greater of land.
A. Fee in lieu of. Where the Town of Irondequoit waives all or part of the
minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver
is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided
downstream of the proposed development, the applicant shall be
required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the Town of
Irondequoit. All monetary contributions shall be made to a dedicated
fund for stormwater management activities. The fee structure shall be
based on the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater
management of the development in question. All of the monetary
contributions shall be made by the applicant prior to the issuance of any
permit or approval for the development.
B. Dedication or easement of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an
applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management
by entering into an agreement with the Town of Irondequoit for the
granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be
used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility.
The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the Town of
Irondequoit prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is
required, prior to the issuance of the permit.
§ 196-23 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 196-25

A. The applicant shall consult the Town of Irondequoit's Design Criteria,
the New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual and the
New York Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment
Control for standards and specifications related to stormwater
management design criteria. Stormwater management practices that
are designed and constructed in accordance with these technical
documents shall be presumed to meet the standards imposed by this
law. If there is a conflict between any of the standards, the more
stringent standard shall apply. Where stormwater management
practices are not in accordance with technical standards, the applicant
or developer must demonstrate equivalence to the technical standards
set forth in this section (§ 196-25) and § 196-26, and the SWPPP shall be
prepared by a licensed/certified professional.
B. The following design and performance criteria shall be addressed for
stormwater management at all sites:
(1) All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices
to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated
with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas
for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from
driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas
to the maximum extent practicable to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
(2) All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional
wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Where
such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the Town of Irondequoit. In no case shall the impact
on functional values be any greater than that allowed by the Army
Corps of Engineers (COE) or the NYSDEC responsible for natural
resources.
(3) An attempt shall be made to maintain annual groundwater
recharge rates by promoting infiltration through the use of
structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, an attempt
shall be made for annual recharge from the postdevelopment site to
mimic the annual recharge from predevelopment site conditions.
(4) In order to protect stream channels from degradation, a specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the
Town of Irondequoit's Design Criteria and/or the New York State
Stormwater Management Design Manual.
(5) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.

194:439
§ 196-26. Stormwater pollution prevention plan requirements.
(6) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots," may require the
use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices and
pollution prevention practices.
(7) Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Town of
Irondequoit to determine if they are subject to additional
stormwater design requirements.
(8) The calculations for determining peak flows (WQv) as found in the
New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual shall be
used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
A. SWPPP required; implementation.
(1) An SWPPP is required as part of the compliance with this article.

calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of
the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development
of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the
effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for
managing stormwater generated at the project site. The plan must
be signed by a New York State licensed professional engineer (PE),
who will verify that the design of all stormwater management
practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the New
York State Stormwater Management Design Manual. No building
or grading permit or site plan approval shall be issued until a
satisfactory stormwater pollution prevention plan, or a waiver
thereof, has undergone a review and been approved by the Town of
Irondequoit after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent
with the requirements of this chapter.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Right-of-Way Law of

§ 199-2. Purpose.
The placement of obstructions in, and the paving of, a public right-of-way
within the Town of Irondequoit is detrimental to the health, safety and
general welfare of the community. The same also constitutes an attractive
nuisance to children and in many ways imperils their safety. Obstructions
and paving of any sort creates dangerous situations by obstructing the
view of pedestrians or motorists, damaging Town tree root systems, lawns
and the roadway and is also unsightly and depreciates all property values.
The control of the public right-of-way within the Town of Irondequoit is,
therefore, regulated for the preservation of the health, safety and general
welfare of the community.

regulations, see Chapter 192.)
RIGHT-OF-WAY  The land owned by the state, county or Town which is

Planning Board shall make its own findings and its
decision on the final plat within 62 days after the close of
the public hearing on such final plat or within 30 days of
the adoption of findings by the lead agency, whichever
period is longer. The grounds for a modification, if any, or
the grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the
records of the Planning Board.
E. Approval and certification of final plats.
(1) Certification of plat. Within five business days of the adoption of the
resolution granting conditional or final approval of the final plat,
such plat shall be certified by the Clerk of the Planning Board as
having been granted conditional or final approval, and a copy of
such resolution and plat shall be filed in such Clerk's office. A copy
of the resolution shall be mailed to the applicant. In the case of a
conditionally approved plat, such resolution shall include a
statement of the requirements which, when completed, will
authorize the signing thereof. Upon completion of such
requirements, the plat shall be signed by said duly authorized
officer of the Planning Board, and a copy of such signed plat shall
be filed with the Town Clerk.
(2) Approval of plat in sections. In granting conditional or final
approval of a plat in final form, the Planning Board may permit the
plat to be subdivided and developed in two or more sections and
may, in its resolution granting conditional or final approval, state
that such requirements as it deems necessary to ensure the orderly
development of the plat be completed before said sections may be
signed by the duly authorized officer of the Planning Board.
Conditional or final approval of the sections of a final plat may be
granted concurrently with conditional or final approval of the
§ 204-10 RIGHTS-OF-WAY § 204-10

entire plat, subject to any requirements imposed by the Planning
Board.
(3) Duration of conditional approval of final plat. Conditional approval
of the final plat shall expire within 180 days after the resolution
granting such approval, unless all requirements stated in such
resolution have been certified as completed. The Planning Board
may extend by not more than two additional periods of 90 days
each, the time in which a conditionally approved plat must be
submitted for signature if, in the Planning Board's opinion, such
extension is warranted by the particular circumstances.
F. Default approval of preliminary or final plat. The time periods
prescribed herein within which a Planning Board must take action on a
preliminary plat or a final plat are specifically intended to provide the
Planning Board and the public adequate time for review and to
minimize delays in the processing of subdivision applications. Such
periods may be extended only by mutual consent of the owner and the
Planning Board. In the event that a Planning Board fails to take action
on a preliminary plat or a final plat within the time prescribed therefor
after completion of all requirements under the State Environmental
Quality Review Act, or within such extended period as may have been
established by the mutual consent of the owner and the Planning Board,
such preliminary or final plat shall be deemed granted approval. The
certificate of the Town Clerk as to the date of submission of the
preliminary or final plat and the failure of the Planning Board to take
action within the prescribed time shall be issued on demand and shall
be sufficient in lieu of written endorsement or other evidence of
approval herein required.
G. Filing of decision on final plat. Within five business days from the date
of the adoption of the resolution approving the final plat, the Chair or
other duly authorized member of the Planning Board shall cause a copy
of such resolution to be filed in the office of the Town Clerk.
H. Filing of final plat; expiration of approval.
(1) The applicant shall file in the office of the County Clerk or register
such approved final plat or a section of such plat within 62 days
from the date of final approval or such approval shall expire. The
following shall constitute final approval:

approved plat in the office of the County Clerk or register, the
entire approved plat shall be filed within 30 days of the filing of
such section with the Town Clerk in each town in which any portion
of the land described in the plat is situated. Such section shall
encompass at least 10% of the total number of lots contained in the
approved plat and the approval of the remaining sections of the
approved plat shall expire unless said sections are filed before the
expiration of the exemption period to which such plat is entitled
under the provisions of Subdivision 2 of § 265-a of the Town Law, as
amended or changed.

assure the complete installation of the required improvements within
such period, as shall be fixed by the Planning Board. The Planning
Board, with the consent of all parties to the letter of credit, may extend
such period upon written application of the applicant filed with the
Town Clerk prior to the expiration of such period or upon its own
motion at any time prior to a declaration of a default in the letter of
credit by the Planning Board.
B. The Planning Board may modify its requirements with the approval of
the Town Board and upon findings either that the extent of building
development that has taken place in the subdivision is substantially
completed or the subdivision development has been reduced after
approval by the Planning Board so as to warrant reduction in the face
amount of the bond.
C. Except as provided in the preceding subsection, the letter of credit shall
be released only upon complete installation of the required
improvements, the submission of the certified record, (as-built)
drawings, as required herein, and a certificate from the applicant's
engineer that the completed works are in substantial conformance with

D. Land subject to flooding. Land subject to flooding or land deemed by
the Planning Board to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger
to health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such land
within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or improved in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board to remedy said hazardous
conditions.
E. Flood hazard prevention. The applicant shall be required to control soil
erosion of land surface and drainage channels and the prevention of
inundation and excessive groundwater seepage by comprehensive site
grading and the establishment of adequate elevations of buildings,
building openings and roadways above the observed, anticipated or
computed water levels of storm sewers, streams, channels, floodplains,
retention basins and swales.

(b) A tabular form (see Appendix B for typical format87) showing
computed runoffs and design capacities of the drainage
system.
(5) Points of discharge. Storm drainage shall be discharged to
recognized USGS drainage courses. This may require applicants to
obtain downstream easements from adjoining property owners to
permit this drainage across their properties. The applicant shall be
required to construct and maintain temporary silt settling basins at
the point of discharge into the stream. The basin shall be operable
until the completion of the subdivision.
G. Storm drains. Storm drains shall conform to the following
specifications:
(1) Minimum pipe sizes shall be 12 inches in diameter.
(2) Minimum velocity when flowing full shall be three feet per second.
(3) Maximum manhole and catch basin spacing shall be 300 linear feet.
(4) Builders (where necessary) shall provide backwater valves on all
laterals where the storm drain is at such an elevation to permit
gravity drainage from the basements adjacent to the system.

parallel or straight alignment.
(2) Easements for natural watercourses.
(a) Natural primary watercourses which traverse a development
shall be preserved by an easement of sufficient width,
including overbanks, which will adequately pass the projected
design flow. The gross allowable depth of flow shall not create
a flood hazard to existing or proposed development and
improvements. The channel and overbank widths, together
with a minimum twenty-foot continuous maintenanceway on
each side, shall constitute the floodway encroachment limits,
as further defined under the EPOD District regulations of
Chapter 235, Zoning.
(b) In natural tertiary and secondary watercourses which contain
insufficient waterway area to convey the flow from the ultimate
development, but which may prove deficient only at infrequent
intervals and location, and where minor improvements could
provide an adequate channel and still preserve, in the main,
the natural channel beauty or fish and wildlife values, the
applicant shall make such minor channel improvements as are
required to provide a channel which would otherwise meet the
conditions of this chapter. Additional widths of scenic areas
and areas of natural wetlands which, for economic reasons or
limited suitability, would not warrant improving for urban
development, may be dedicated by the applicant in addition to
those above. Areas offered for dedication to the town as
drainage easements, if considered of special interest to the
town by the Planning Board, may be considered by the
Planning Board as dedication for the municipal purposes of
§ 278 of the Town Law, as amended or changed, and its
authority thereunder.

Installation and Construction Procedures
§ 204-57. General provisions.
A. Interpretation of drawings. The contractor shall abide by and comply
with the true intent and meaning of all drawings and of the
specifications taken as a whole. If the contractor believes that the
construction indicated on the project drawings will not, when executed,
produce safe and substantial results or if it appears that there is any
discrepancy in the drawings, it is his or her duty immediately to notify
the applicant's engineer, in writing, and to thereafter proceed only upon
written order.
B. Protection of property and work.
(1) The contractor shall so conduct his or her operations as to damage
no more than is absolutely necessary, trees, garden plots,
shrubbery, pipe lines, conduits, buildings and other structures. The
contractor shall use all necessary precautions to protect the work
and adjacent structures of all kinds during construction, and shall
so conduct his or her operations so that at no time shall the work or
such structures be endangered.
(2) Responsibility and damage. The applicant shall be responsible for
all parts of his or her work, temporary or permanent, until the
project is accepted by the town, and he or she shall thoroughly
protect all work, finished or unfinished, against damage from any
cause, as all work is at the contractor's risk until the same is
accepted by the applicant. The use of part or all of the work by the
town, as provided for in these specifications, shall not relieve the
applicant of his or her responsibility. The contractor shall be
responsible for damage to life and property due to his or her
operations and shall provide all necessary guards, rails, nightlights,
etc.
C. Permits. The applicant and/or contractor shall secure all necessary
permits from the town and any other authority which may have control
over any structures involved before construction begins.
D. Existing utilities or structures. Before construction begins near any
existing utility or structures, the contractor shall notify the appropriate
utility owner of his or her intention, and their instructions as to the
protection of their property must be followed. Before commencing
work, the contractor shall determine the exact locations of any
structure or underground utility in order that the contractor's project
will not damage or disrupt these facilities.
E. Facilities for inspection. The contractor shall furnish all reasonable
facilities and aid to the inspectors and safe and convenient footways,
scaffolds, ladders, etc., that may be needed for the examination and
§ 204-57 RIGHTS-OF-WAY § 204-57
199:531
§ 204-58. Trench excavation.
inspection of any part of the work. Inspectors may stop work when the
contractor has no responsible agent on the project, or if he or she feels
that the contractor is not performing the work in the best interests of
the town. Disorderly, intemperate and incompetent persons shall not
be allowed on the project; the employees who neglect or refuse to
follow the inspector's instructions shall be permanently removed from
the project.
A. Excavation. Under this term shall be included all excavations in
trenches and pits, together with all backfilling and embankments that
may be needed for the laying of the utilities and appurtenances or that
may be necessary for the laying, changing and construction of any other
water, gas or drain pipes, sewers, conduits, culverts, drainage ditches
or watercourses, either under or over the proposed pipes, or for any
other incidental work that may be ordered by the engineers, and all
shall be done in accordance with the federal safety standards of OSHA.
B. Width of trenches. The trenches shall be of such width as may be
required by the approved design to ensure proper and workmanlike
laying and handling of the pipes and appurtenances, proper tamping
and backfilling when laid. In all cases, trenches shall be kept as narrow
as possible. The contractor shall be responsible to provide sheeting/
bracing or other requirements to ensure the safety of his or her workers
in conjunction with the proper installation of the pipe.
C. Depth of trenches. The trenches for the main shall be in general
excavated to such a depth to install the main to the grade established in
the field after said main is properly bedded with suitable material.
D. Tunneling. All work shall be done in open trenches or excavations, no
tunneling shall be done except in these areas specifically called for on
the approved plans and then only with experienced personnel under the
guidelines of OSHA.
E. Blasting. Whenever necessary to resort to blasting for making the
excavations, the trench shall be covered on the top and sides with heavy
timbers or mats to prevent fragments of rock from being thrown out, or
rock may be drilled and shot before excavating if the rock is at a
minimum depth of four feet to provide enough cover for safety. Only
experienced, skillful and trustworthy workers shall be employed in the
handling and uses of explosives, or have access thereto. All blasting
operations shall be conducted in strict accordance with existing
ordinances, regulations and specifications relative to rock blasting and
the storage and use of explosives.
F. Bailing and draining. The contractor shall furnish a sufficient pumping
plant and shall provide and maintain, at his or her own expense,
satisfactory drainage whenever needed in the trench and other
excavations during the progress of the work and at its completion for
§ 204-57 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 204-58
199:532
§ 204-59. Pipes.
final inspection. No structures shall be laid in water. Water shall not be
allowed to flow or rise upon any concrete or other masonry. All water
pumped or bailed from the trench or other excavation shall be conveyed
in a proper manner to a suitable point of discharge.
G. Bottom of trench. The bottom of the trench shall be carefully graded
and formed according to the specification of the material manufacturer
and to the satisfaction of the Town Engineer before any pipes are laid
therein. When other instructions are not given, the trenches shall
always be excavated in a straight line. In hard pan, boulder formations,
loose rock or solid rock, the excavation shall extend at least six inches
below the bottom of the pipe, and a carefully compacted bed of selected
earth or sand or crushed stone placed in the bottom of the trench up to
the level of the bottom of the pipe. It is the intention of this specification
to achieve not less than Class B pipe bedding.
H. Suitable bedding and safety backfill material. It shall be the
responsibility of the contractor to utilize material excavated from the
trench in order to achieve this end. Should the nature of the soil down
to the required depth be such that the contractor is unable to meet the
above requirements by selecting pipe bedding and backfilling with
reasonable care from the excavated material, he or she shall provide
the following bedding materials if so ordered by the town's Inspector:
(1) A sand, stone or concrete cradle when the trench bottom does not
provide sufficient bearing capacity.
(2) A sand cradle shall be provided when the trench is excavated in
rock, boulders or hard pan and none of the material above this level
is suitable for bedding the pipe but is acceptable as backfill when
placed carefully.
(3) Sand encasement shall be ordered by the Town Engineer when the
trench is excavated in rock, boulders or hard pan and none of the
material above this level is suitable for bedding or backfilling the
pipe.
A. Line and grade. All pipes and appurtenances of whatever character
shall, when set, conform to the alignments and grades required by the
Town Engineer; and as the work proceeds, all of the required special
castings and other fixtures that are indicated upon the plans or that
may be required during the progress of the work shall be installed in
their proper positions.
B. Laying pipe. The contractor shall use suitable tools and appliances for
the safe and convenient handling and laying of the pipes and all
appurtenances. All pipes and castings shall be carefully examined by
the contractor for defects and no pipe or casting which is known to be
defective shall be laid. If defective pipe or castings should be
§ 204-58 RIGHTS-OF-WAY § 204-59
199:533
§ 204-60. Manholes.
discovered after being laid, these shall be removed and replaced with
sound pipe or castings. The pipes shall be cleaned before they are laid
and shall be kept clean until they are accepted with the completed
work. All pipe ends shall be capped, except during the actual
pipelaying.
(1) Sewers shall be built to straight lines and grades between angle
points or manholes. Batter boards and/or grade lines shall be
provided at sufficient intervals (maximum of 25 feet) for the proper
installation of the pipe. Sewer pipe shall be laid upgrade with
spigots placed in the direction of the flow. All pipes shall be fitted
together to form a smooth, even invert. Pipes disturbed after laying
shall be taken up and relaid. Any necessary pipe cutting shall be
done by skilled workers with sharp tools.
(2) After the pipe has been placed and adjusted to line and grade, the
bed shall be trimmed to support the pipe for its entire length.
Material used for bedding shall be rammed under the bottom and
the haunches of the pipe. The trench shall then be completely filled
to above the top of the pipe with similar material carefully
compacted into place to hold the pipe in position.
C. Cutting pipe. Whenever it may be necessary to cut any straight pipe for
any purpose, cutting shall be done to the satisfaction of the Town
Engineer by skilled workers with proper tools, in such manner as will
not cause any cracking of the pipe.
A. Sanitary manholes. Manholes shall be constructed at the locations
shown upon the map, or as designated by the Town Engineer. The
vertical pipe sections shall be cast in such lengths that the top of the
roof slab shall be not more than 15 inches below the finished surface
grade, and a minimum height within the manhole of not less than four
feet clear from the bench to the underside of the roof slab shall be
allowed. The slabs shall be formed to fit into the ends of the vertical
pipe and shall have a full bearing for its entire circumference. The slab
shall be set in a bed of cement mortar. All manhole joints shall be
purged on the outside and coal tar coated.
B. Drop manhole.
(1) Wherever the invert of the entering sewer is more than two feet
above the invert of the outlet sewer, it shall be connected with an
outside drop with a cleanout pipe half bricked up. Where possible,
the drops shall be constructed with vertical drop pipes; otherwise,
the drop may be offset. When drops are placed, the entire
excavation around the drop pipe shall be filled with concrete
extending not less than two feet along the main sewer.
§ 204-59 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 204-60
199:534
§ 204-61. Laterals and water services.
(2) The cleanout opening in the barrel of the manhole shall be cut in
after the manhole wall pipe is in place, and the joint between the
cleanout pipe and the manhole wall shall be thoroughly sealed with
non-shrink cement mortar and coal tar coated.
C. Shallow sewer manholes. Where any manhole is five feet three inches
or less from the invert to the bottom of the roof slab for an eight-inch
sewer, the contractor is to provide a manhole as shown in Appendix H.93
D. Sealing of manholes. All sanitary manholes shall be sealed on all
interior and exterior walls and joints with two coats of coal tar manhole
sealer to achieve a minimum dry thickness of 11 mills, and shall be
tested along with all sewers for infiltration and exfiltration.
E. Storm manholes. Storm manholes shall be constructed to a minimum
inside diameter of four feet zero inches.
(1) Where shallow manholes occur, they shall not be corbelled to finish
grade but remain at the same diameter.
(2) A brick invert shall be required only on manholes where 18 inches
or less of storm drain pass through. The inside surfaces shall not
require a seal coat, although the inside shall be finished in a
smooth and neat fashion. Exterior surfaces shall be sealed as
specified in Subsection D above.
(3) Manhole frames shall be adjusted to finish grade and properly set
in mortar.
F. Catch basins. Catch basins shall be constructed to the dimensions as
shown in the Appendix F.94
G. Frames and covers. The frame shall be firmly set in a bed of not less
than one full inch of cement mortar adjusted to the finished grade. The
cover shall fit tightly in the frame and rest on the frame for its entire
length so that it does not rattle when vehicles pass over it. The manhole
frame may be set directly on the concrete roof slab, provided that the
top will be at the proper grade; otherwise, the frame shall be set on up
to three courses of brick masonry laid around the roof opening to bring
the cover up to grade. Such brick masonry shall be given a one-half-inch
plaster coat on the inside and outside and then coal tar coated.
A. Laterals and water services shall be installed to the right-of-way (or
easement) lines for all lots. The laterals shall be tightly capped. Each
service shall be located with a two-inch-by-four-inch witness stake

B. At the time that the development is offered to the town for dedication,
an accurate record plan showing the locations of all laterals and all of
the respective witness stakes must be visible. Each cleanout and end
cap must be located with three ties. Wye branches locations shall be
measured from center of manhole covers.95
A. Generally. When for any reason the work is left unfinished, all trenches
and other excavations shall be filled. The roadways and sidewalks shall
be left unobstructed, with their surface in a safe and satisfactory
condition. In all pipe trenches, whether in paved streets or not, the
backfill shall be carefully tamped around the pipes. On unpaved streets,
the backfill above the pipe shall be carefully consolidated and
compacted in order to prevent settlement. Whenever practicable, the
trench shall be tamped sufficiently to prevent any settlement of or
damage to adjacent structures, whether pipe lines or conduits or other
structures, and no trench shall be backfilled before it is inspected by
the Town Engineer or Town Inspector.
B. Backfill immediately after approval. In this operation, no stones shall be
thrown in. Only the finest selected earth material shall be deposited
under and around the pipes and appurtenances, covering them by hand
for a depth of at least 12 inches above the pipe. This earth shall be
thoroughly tamped or rammed as it is being thrown in (particularly
around and under the haunches of the pipe) so as to fill the lower
portion of the trench thoroughly throughout and give said pipe a solid
bearing for its entire length. The material must not be thrown down
from above faster than the workers below can properly distribute and
compact it. Approval of the state, county and town highway authorities
shall be obtained if the completed backfill is in an area under their
jurisdiction.

§ 204-64. Test of underground utilities.
C. Restrictions as to materials. No rock or frozen earth shall be put in the
trench until the refilling has reached at least two feet above the top of
the pipe lines, and then not unless especially permitted by the Town
Engineer. All spaces between suitable pieces of rock shall be thoroughly
filled with earth by backfilling in alternate layers of rock and earth.
Needless humps after refilling trenches in unpaved streets and humps
and hollows in the temporary surfacing of paved streets will not be
tolerated, and if any such are found, they shall be immediately
remedied by the contractor.
D. Cleaning up.
(1) As the work progresses or as directed by the Town Engineer, all
rubbish or refuse, unused materials and tools, shall be removed at
once from along and near the area in which the lines and other
structures have been built.
(2) Rough cleanup along the route shall immediately follow installation
procedures. Large spoil banks will not be permitted in a developed
area.
(3) Final cleanup and rough grading and landscaping shall proceed
immediately after the installation, testing and approval of the
facilities.
(4) In all cases, the project site shall be restored to a condition equal to
or better than that which previously existed to meet the approval of
the Town Engineer.
E. Surplus material removal. Where there is a surplus of material not
required in refilling the trenches, it shall be promptly removed by the
contractor at his or her expense and deposited at points approved by
the Town Engineer, unless such surplus materials are claimed and
removed by the applicant.
A. General provisions. Upon the satisfactory completion of the installation
of the underground utilities, the contractor shall proceed to test each of
the installed facilities as herein specified. The tests shall be conducted
in the presence of the Town Engineer or Inspector. Records and data of
these tests shall be submitted to the town.
B. Sanitary sewers.
(1) All sewers shall be flushed and lamped and then a ball one inch less
in diameter than the sewer shall be passed through the pipe.
(2) An exfiltration test shall be placed on the completed system
(including laterals to the property line) with a water loss not to
exceed 100 gallons per inch diameter of pipe per mile per day.
§ 204-63 RIGHTS-OF-WAY § 204-64
199:537
§ 204-65. Roads, gutters and sidewalks.
(3) In areas where sewer grades preclude an exfiltration test or where
a high groundwater table exists, an infiltration test shall be
conducted wherein water entering the system shall not exceed the
limits specified in Subsection B(2) of this section.
C. Storm drains. All drains shall be flushed and lamped to ensure that no
obstacles are obstructing the flow of the pipe.
D. All storm and sanitary sewers must be televised on a VHS tape and a
copy of the tape given to the Commissioner of Public Works for review.96
E. Water mains. Water mains shall conform to requirements of the Monroe
County Water Authority or Sea Breeze and Vicinity Water District.97
F. Defective areas. In those areas where satisfactory results of applied
tests cannot be obtained, the defective portion of the system shall be
located and replaced with new material and not repaired. That portion
of the system shall then be retested until satisfactory results are
obtained. Use of repair clamps shall not be permitted.98
A. General provisions. The contractor shall not proceed to construct any of
these items until the underground system has been installed, tested and
approved. Careful attention shall be given to obtaining maximum
compaction in backfilled areas. The type of soil prevalent in this town
precludes ultimate compaction in a short period of time. Therefore,
final paving of the road surface shall be delayed for a period of seven
months or at least until a winter season has passed since the completion
and approval of the underground system. The road shall be constructed
to the shape and dimensions shown in the Appendix D.99 A greater road
width may be required by the Planning Board in those areas where high
traffic volumes are required.
B. Roads and gutters.
(1) Subbase. Excavation to the subgrade elevation may commence
immediately after the approval of the underground system.
Subgrade elevations are to be established from stakes set at
intervals not to exceed 50 feet. The subgrade shall be graded to
remove all unsatisfactory or unstable material. Where material is
removed below the subgrade elevation, suitable granular material
shall be brought in. The entire subgrade surface shall be
thoroughly compacted with a ten-ton steel-wheeled roller. No
movement shall be observed in the subgrade material as the roller
passes.

be sealed with two coats of clear sealer applied at the rate of 0.10
gallons per square yard. The gutters, prior to the placement of the
final pavement surface, shall be flooded to ensure satisfactory
drainage to the catch basins. In those areas where pockets occur,
the gutter sections shall be removed and replaced to proper grades
to ensure positive drainage. Formless or slip form construction
shall be permitted, provided that the gutters conform to the
standard town detail.
(4) Binder material. Binder material shall be placed and compacted to
a finished layer two inches thick. The binder shall be thoroughly
compacted from the outside edges inward with a ten-ton steelwheeled
roller so that no movement or wearing of the material is
observed ahead of the roller.
(5) Surface course.
(a) Preparation for placement of the surface course shall begin
after a thorough investigation of the binder and base areas has
been made by the Town Engineer or Commissioner of Public
Works. All depressions shall be properly filled in to bring them
up to proper elevation. The binder course shall be cleaned of
all dirt or foreign material.
(b) The surface course of asphaltic concrete shall be placed to a
compacted thickness of one inch. A ten-ton steel-wheeled roller
shall be used. No movement or weaving shall be observed
ahead of the roller.

ARTICLE VIII
Lake Ontario and Connected Waterways Assessment Relief
[Adopted 8-15-2017 by L.L. No. 6-2017]
§ 210-34. Legislative intent.
The Town Board of the Town of Irondequoit determines that high
floodwaters during the spring and summer of 2017 on Lake Ontario and
Irondequoit Bay have caused significant damage to private property. On
May 12, 2017, the Town of Irondequoit entered into a state of emergency
as a result of the threat to public and private property, and public safety,
presented by the high floodwaters. The Town Board finds that the damage
to property occurred after March 1, 2017, the date by which under state
law a properties assessed value is based. As a result, a large number of
property owners have experienced significant loss to the value of their
homes, yet have a real property tax liability that is based on the value of
their home before flooding occurred. The Town Board is authorized by Part
B of Chapter 85 of the 2017 Laws of New York State to enact a local law to
provide assessment relief to homeowners impacted by high floodwaters.
§ 210-35. Election of assessment relief.
The Town of Irondequoit hereby elects to provide assessment relief for
real property that lost at least 10% of its improved value due to sustained
floodwater levels throughout 2017. The Assessor of the Town of Irondequoit
is hereby authorized to reduce the assessed value attributable to the 2017
tax roll to reflect loss of improved value to real property from floodwaters,
as prescribed by Part B of Chapter 85 of the 2017 Laws of New York
State (the Lake Ontario and Connected Waterways Assessment Relief Act).
Any exemptions which the property may be receiving shall be adjusted as
necessary to account for such reduction in total assessed value.
§ 210-36. Provisions.
A. The percentage loss in improved value for the purposes of this article
shall be determined by the Assessor, determined in manner provided by
this article.
B. To receive such relief pursuant to this article, the property owner shall
submit a written request to the Assessor on a form approved by the
New York State Commissioner of the Department of Taxation and
Finance. Such request shall attach any and all reports prepared by, but
not limited to, an insurance adjuster, real property appraiser or broker
that describe in reasonable detail the damage caused to the property by
the flooding and the condition of the property following the flooding and
may be accompanied by any other supporting documentation.
C. Upon receiving such a request, the Assessor shall make a finding as
percentage of lost improved value the property as a result of flooding,
§ 210-34 SWIMMING § 210-36
206:565
and thereafter the Assessor shall adopt or classify the percentage loss
of improved value within one of the following ranges:
Loss of Improved Value
(percentage)
Reduction of Improved
Assessed Value
(percentage)
At least 10% but less than 20% 15%
At least 20% but less than 30% 25%
At least 30% but less than 40% 35%
At least 40% but less than 50% 45%
At least 50% but less than 60% 55%
At least 60% but less than 70% 65%
At least 70% but less than 80% 75%
At least 80% but less than 90% 85%
At least 90% but less than 100% 95%
100% 100%
D. The Assessor shall mail written notice of such findings to the property
owner and any other participating municipality, as that term is defined
in the Lake Ontario and Connected Waterways Assessment Relief Act.
Where the Assessor classifies the loss within a lower range than the
property owner believes is warranted, the property owner may file a
complaint with the Board of Assessment Review. Such board shall
reconvene upon 10 days' written notice to the property owner and
Assessor to hear the appeal and determine the matter, and shall mail
written notice of its determination to the Assessor and property owner.
The provisions of Article 5 of the Real Property Tax Law shall govern the
review process to the extent practicable.
E. Where it is determined that a property has lost at least 10% of its
improved value, as that term is defined in the Lake Ontario and
Connected Waterways Assessment Relief Act, due to flooding, the
assessed value attributable to the improvements on the property on the
impacted assessment roll shall be reduced by the appropriate
percentage specified in Subsection C of this section, provided that any
exemptions which the property may be receiving shall be adjusted as
necessary to account for such reduction in the total assessed value.
F. A failure on the part of an Assessor to act on an application for
assessment relief for a property that would otherwise be eligible for
such assessment relief, shall be considered a clerical error under
Paragraph (c) of Subdivision 2 of § 550 of the New York State Real
Property Tax Law.
G. This article shall not diminish any other legally available right of any
property owner or party who may otherwise lawfully challenge the
valuation or assessment of any real property or improvements thereon.
§ 210-36 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 210-36
206:566
All remaining rights hereby remain and shall be available to the party
to whom such rights would otherwise be available notwithstanding this
article.

Motor Vehicles Law of the Town of Irondequoit."
§ 225-2. Purpose. [Amended 4-23-2002 by L.L. No. 9-2002]
The outdoor storage of unlicensed/unregistered and junked motor vehicles
on privately owned property or within a public right-of-way within the Town
of Irondequoit is detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the
community. The same also constitutes an attractive nuisance to children and
in many ways imperils their safety. Such storage also endangers the person
and property of members of the community, since fuel tanks still containing
gasoline or gasoline fumes may easily explode. Such storage is unsightly
and depreciates all property values. The control of the outdoor storage
of unlicensed/unregistered and junked motor vehicles on privately owned
properties (and within a public right-of-way within the Town of Irondequoit)
is, therefore, regulated for the preservation of the health, safety and general
welfare of the community.

ARTICLE IXA
LaSalle's Landing Development District (LLDD)
[Added 8-19-1997 by L.L. No. 6-1997]
§ 235-35.1. Purpose; goals.
A. Pursuant to a joint land use plan adopted by the Towns of Irondequoit
and Penfield, the LaSalle's Landing Development District (LLDD) is
designed to provide a suitable character and stable environment for the
establishment and maintenance of water-oriented and/or waterenhanced
uses and activities along the shoreline of Irondequoit Bay and
its adjacent wetlands. The district is also designed to protect the unique
and sensitive environmental features that exist along the Bay shoreline,
and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare. The
district is also designed to promote and encourage public access to the
shore zone and appropriate water-oriented recreational and other
appropriate development adjacent to the shore zone.
B. The LLDD permits moderate-density residential development, as well
as certain commercial, recreational and open-space uses that serve the
residents of and visitors to this district, as well as the Town, and that
generally benefit from and enhance the unique aesthetic and
environmental qualities of the Town's waterfront areas. The purpose of
this district includes the following specific goals:
(1) To ensure that development and land-use activity along the
shoreline of Irondequoit Bay is consistent with the policies and
objectives of the Towns of Irondequoit's and Penfield's Local
Waterfront Revitalization Programs (LWRP).
(2) To provide sufficient space in appropriate waterfront locations for
moderate-density residential development, recreational activities,
certain commercial activities and other water-oriented uses, in
order to meet the various housing and recreational needs of the
Towns of Irondequoit's and Penfield's present and future
populations.
(3) To recognize the sensitivity of waterfront areas as unique
environmental and recreational resources and to protect these
areas from environmentally destructive uses and activities.
(4) To provide for a desirable mix of water-oriented commercial uses
and active and passive recreational opportunities that take
advantage of the unique locations and characteristics of the Towns'
waterfront areas.
(5) To encourage development that is appropriately designed and in
harmony with its environment and that does not conflict with the
preservation of the natural beauty of the Towns' waterfront areas.
§ 235-35.1 LITTERING § 235-35.1
230:703
(6) To promote the most desirable and appropriate use of land and
direction of building development based upon land and soil types
and other natural features, environmental constraints,
neighborhood characteristics and overall community needs.
(7) To protect the character of the district and its peculiar suitability
for particular uses; to conserve the value of land and buildings; and
to protect and enhance the tax revenue bases of the Towns of
Irondequoit and Penfield.
(8) To permit development in areas which, by virtue of their locations,
topography, accessibility, relationship to surrounding land uses,
zoning patterns and natural features and availability of public
services and utilities, are best suited for a particular purpose; and
to preserve areas that are naturally unsuited for development or
that have unique historical, aesthetic or environmental
significance.
(9) To encourage flexibility of design and preservation of unique
environmental features through, for example, the use of Town Law
§ 278 (cluster development) and/or incentive zoning where
applicable, and maintenance of the aesthetic quality of waterfront
areas by permitting the Town of Irondequoit and the Town of
Penfield to establish consistent minimum dimensional
requirements for permitted principal uses, and to review other
pertinent design aspects of such proposed projects.
(10) To preserve, wherever feasible, the existing vegetation and natural
features of waterfront areas and to prevent, as much as possible,
significant erosion, sedimentation and drainage problems, both
during and after construction.
(11) To encourage and facilitate water-oriented recreational
development within the shore zone, as permitted principal uses or
as accessory uses where compatible with the primary purpose of
the proposed development.
(12) To protect the LaSalle's Landing Development District (LLDD) and
its waterfront areas as much as possible against excessive volumes
of vehicular traffic flow, and to deal with safety problems related to
such vehicular traffic flow.
(13) To protect waterfront areas against congestion, as much as
possible, by regulating the density of population and intensity of
land use, and by requiring the provision of open areas for rest and
recreation, wherever practicable.
(14) To promote the maintenance and/or extension of public access to
the shore zone, where practical and feasible, where such access
relates to and is compatible with the primary purpose of the
proposed development or activity.

NOTES:
1. The open space factors are not intended to be calculated on a
cumulative basis. Where a property is encumbered with more
than one overlapping Environmental Protection Overlay Districts
(EPODs), the EPOD with the higher open space factor would be
used in the subsequently overlapping EPOD area(s).
2. Floodplains, steep slopes, wetlands and watercourses can be
effectively designed to act as buffers between existing and
proposed developments, used as open space within subdivision or
maintained privately as part of the subdivision lots and
homesites.
A reasonable credit is, therefore, provided for the amenity these
features provide in determining the maximum density of
subdivisions.

is declared to be the public policy of the Town of Irondequoit that these
areas shall be protected as invaluable natural resources that provide
for flood protection, wildlife habitats, recreational and open space,
erosion and pollution control and protection and recharging of
groundwater supplies. The regulations contained in this district seek to
prevent the despoilation and destruction of freshwater wetlands by
controlling development in these areas and by requiring review and
permit approval prior to project commencement.
B. Delineation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the Wetland
Protection District shall be delineated on the Official Town of
Irondequoit EPOD Maps and shall include all wetland areas designated
as Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation. The provisions of this
section shall be applicable to all wetland areas within the Town of
Irondequoit and as shown on the Official Town Maps, other than those
areas designated as Type I wetlands by the State Department of
Environmental Conservation. Permit application for development
within all Type I Environmental Conservation shall be reviewed and
approved by the State Department of Environmental Conservation,
subject to the provisions of Part 665 of the New York State Codes, Rules
and Regulations (NYCRR). Upon application for a development permit
within a Wetland Protection District, the Town Department of Planning
and Zoning shall refer such application and site plan to the State
Department of Environmental Conservation in order to determine the
precise boundary of the wetland area. The boundary of a Wetland
Protection District shall include a buffer zone that extends out from the
edge of the wetland area for a distance of 100 feet or three hundred
feet, as determined by the DEC.
C. Regulated activities. No person shall conduct any of the following
regulated activities within any Wetland Protection District in the Town
of Irondequoit, unless such person has first applied for and obtained an
EPOD development permit pursuant to the requirements of this article:

minimize the impacts of development activities on steep slopes in the
Town of Irondequoit by regulating activities in these areas and by
requiring review and permit approval prior to project commencement.
The developmental impacts include soil erosion and sedimentation,
destruction of vegetation, increased runoff rates and slope failure. The
regulations contained in this district are designed to minimize the
disturbance or removal of existing vegetation, prevent increased
erosion and runoff, maintain established drainage systems, locate
development where it is less likely to cause future slope failures and to
retain as much as possible the natural character of these areas.
B. Delineation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the Steep Slope
Protection District shall be delineated on the Official Town of
Irondequoit EPOD Maps and shall include all areas in the Town of
Irondequoit with a fifteen-percent slope or greater. The Town
Department of Planning and Zoning and Town Engineer may consult
other information, including but not limited to soil survey reports
prepared by the Soil Conservation Service, topographic maps produced
by the United States Geological Survey, field surveys and other
appropriate sources in order to more accurately locate and delineate
steep slope protection district boundaries within the Town. The
following additional areas shall also be considered within the "steep
slope" definition:
(1) A transition zone at the top of the slope defined as that area
containing soil classes (as defined in the Monroe County Soil
Survey) with moderate to severe limitations for development and
recreational uses as determined on a site-specific high-intensity
soil survey.

§ 235-54 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 235-55
230:734
A. Purpose. Certain areas of the Town of Irondequoit are subject to
periodic flooding which can result in loss of life, property damage,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commercial and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditure for flood protection and
relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of this Town.
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by
the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses which are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. It is
the purpose of the Floodplain Protection District to prevent public and
private losses due to flood conditions in certain areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Protect the health and welfare of the residents of this Town.
(2) Minimize public expenditure for flood-control projects.
(3) Minimize the need for relief and rescue efforts.
(4) Minimize business interruptions.
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities.
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by minimizing flood damage to
private and commercial property.
(7) Identify those structures and properties which are located in areas
of special flood hazard and maintain such information for public
inspection.
B. Delineation of district boundaries.
(1) The boundaries of the Floodplain Protection District shall be
delineated on the Official Town of Irondequoit EPOD Maps and
shall include all areas of special flood hazard, as identified by the
Federal Insurance Administration through a report entitled the
"Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Irondequoit, New York"
dated December 1977, with an accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Map and Flood Hazard Boundary Map. These maps and any
revision thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of this section.
(2) Where base flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study for areas in the Town of Irondequoit as required
above, the Town Planning Board, Town Department of Planning and
Zoning or Town Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state,
Town or other source in order to administer the standards and
requirements of this section.
(3) For the purposes of this section, there is hereby established within
the Town of Irondequoit three Floodplain Protection Districts to be
§ 235-55 LITTERING § 235-55
230:735
known as "Floodplain Overlay District I (FPO-I)," "Floodplain
Overlay District II (FPO-II)" and "Floodplain Overlay District III
(FPO-III)." The boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District shall
include all areas within the floodways as delineated in the Flood
Insurance Study for the Town of Irondequoit, and as shown on
the National Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of the Town. The
boundaries of the FPO-III Zone shall include all areas within the
one-hundred-year floodplain as delineated in the Town Flood
Insurance Study, but does not include any areas within Floodplain
Overlay District I (FPO-I) and Floodplain Overlay District II (FPOII).
C. Regulated activities.
(1) Prohibited activities. The following activities are not permitted in a
Floodplain Overlay District (FPO):
(a) The temporary or permanent placement of a mobile home or
similar structure.
(b) The construction or operation of an on-site sewage disposal
system.
(c) Any other activity which, as demonstrated through a technical
evaluation, will result in any increase in the flood level during

§ 235-80. Purpose.
The Town of Irondequoit considers the comprehensive review of site
development plans for major principal land uses prior to the issuance
of building permits to be an essential element of local land control. The
site plan review and approval process outlined in this article is designed
to ensure that proposed development projects are constructed based on
accepted engineering, architectural and site design standards and
principles. Site plan review allows developers and Town representatives to
discuss and agree on the most appropriate methods of land development
based on a variety of considerations and criteria. The site plan review
process ensures that development proposals are analyzed for their impacts
on local growth, public facilities and infrastructures, as well as surrounding
land uses and natural features. The site plan review process also ensures
that potential adverse impacts of development are minimized.

principal uses, with the exception of single-family dwellings,
provided that such additions or alterations will affect overall
parking requirements on the site or have otherwise been
determined, by the Town Department of Planning and Zoning,
to require site plan review and approval from the Town
Planning Board.
(2) Accessory uses.
(a) Garages, carports or parking structures for multifamily
dwellings, apartment buildings, townhouses, condominiums, or

Planning Board shall have the power to approve or disapprove any
portions of the site plan on a site-specific basis based upon said
portions' compliance with New York State law and any and all

indicated on the final site plan and substantial site development and/or
construction has begun. An application for preliminary or final site plan
approval that has been denied by the Town Planning Board may not be
resubmitted to the Board for a period of one year from the date of such
decision, unless such plan has been changed or revised to reflect the
concerns and recommendations of the Planning Board indicated in its
notice of denial.
C. In taking action on applications for final site plan approval, the Town
Planning Board shall ensure that, to the extent possible, the
requirements of this chapter have been met or that appropriate
variances have been granted by the Town Zoning Board of Appeals. The
Town Planning Board may impose additional restrictions or conditions
on applications for final site plan approval beyond the general
requirements of this chapter, but within the scope and authority of this
section, if it determines that such restrictions or conditions are
necessary to ensure project conformance with generally accepted
planning, engineering and design standards and criteria to minimize
the project's adverse impact on adjacent land uses and other physical
and environmental features or are directly related to the, health, safety
or general welfare of the community. Such additional restrictions or
conditions shall be in the form of a resolution of approval to be signed
by the applicant as a condition of final site plan approval. Final site plan
approval cannot be granted for any project until all necessary variances
from the Town Zoning Board of Appeals have been granted and/or all
use permits from the Town Board have been granted and a review or

(1) The Town of Irondequoit considers the review and approval of
special use permits for major principal land uses prior to the
issuance of building permits to be an essential element of local land
use control. The special use permit review and approval process
outlined in this article is designed to ensure that certain proposed
development projects meet a predetermined set of standards and
criteria prior to approval, based on the nature of the land use
involved and the characteristics of the site proposed for that land
use. These standards and criteria are designed to ensure that
development costs of proposed projects are minimized or
eliminated altogether. The special use permit review and approval
process ensures that development proposals are analyzed for their
impacts on local growth, public facilities and infrastructure, as well
as surrounding land uses and natural features. The process is also
designed to ensure that land resources are utilized in the most
appropriate and desirable manner.
(2) Except as otherwise provided for in this article with respect to the

§ 235-108. Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
A. Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall
be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits
of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework,
bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise
meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the
display itself.
B. Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
§ 235-107 IRONDEQUOIT CODE § 235-108
230:830
§ 235-109. Signs allowed on private property with and without
permits.
sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are
placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point
at the same time and when such sign faces are part of the same sign
structure and are not more than 24 inches apart, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
C. Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the
newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling,
berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the
sign.
D. Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a zone lot. The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be
computed by applying the formula contained in Table A,151 regarding
maximum total sign area, to the lot frontage, building frontage or wall
area, as appropriate, for the zoning district in which the lot is located.
Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign
area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is
oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the
lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building or
wall area frontage on that street.
A. Signs shall be allowed on private property in the Town in accordance
with, and only in accordance with, Table A.152 If the letter "P" appears
for a sign type in a column, such sign is allowed without prior permit
approval in the zoning districts represented by that column. If the letter
"S" appears for a sign in a column, such sign is allowed only with prior
permit approval in the zoning districts represented by that column.
Special conditions may apply in some cases. If the letter "N" appears for
a sign type in a column, such a sign is not allowed in the zoning districts
represented by that column under any circumstances.
B. Although permitted under the previous subsection, a sign designated by
an "S" or "P" in Table A shall be allowed only if:
(1) The size, location and number of signs on the lot conform with the
requirements of Tables B and C which establish permitted sign
dimensions by sign type, and with any additional limitations listed
in Table A.
