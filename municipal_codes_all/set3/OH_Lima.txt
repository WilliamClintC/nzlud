printed on the ballots, the two following propositions, one above the other, in
the following order:

      The election authorities shall provide a clear method or process for the
electors to vote for either of such propositions. (Amended 5-7-13)
SECTION 21.   RESULT OF RECALL ELECTION

elective officer of the City are against the recall, the officer shall continue

a new recall petition.  If a majority of votes are for the recall of the
officer, the officer shall, regardless of any defect in the recall petition, be
deemed removed from office on the date the election results are certified by
the election authorities.
   (B)   When a person is removed from office by recall, Council shall appoint
a qualified person to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term of the
officer recalled. The Mayor may appoint a person to hold the office of the
person recalled as an acting officer and to perform the duties thereof between
the occurrence of the recall and the time when the person appointed by the City
Council takes the office.
   (C)   Any person who is recalled from an elective office of the city shall
not be eligible for election or appointment to any elective office of the city
for a period of one (1) year from the date of the recall election. (Amended 5-

removed thereby, no subsequent recall petition may be filed until at least six
(6) months after that recall election, but not in the last year of that
officer’s term of office. (Amended 11-5-63; 5-7-13)

utility shall be granted, and no such grant shall be renewed, extended or
amended, except by ordinance. Every such proposed grant and every proposed
renewal or extension of such grant provided by ordinance passed by the Council

of twenty-five years for operating street railways from the day of such grant,
renewal, extension or amendment and providing such grant, renewal, extension or
amendment be passed by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
members of the Council.
SECTION 109.   CONSENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS
   The consent of abutting and adjacent property owners shall not be required
for the construction, extension, maintenance or operation of any public

commenced within two years after the damage is begun.
SECTION 110.   TERMINATION OF ORIGINAL GRANTS
   Grants made to owners of existing franchises to operate and maintain public
utilities in addition to such existing franchises of the same kind, shall be
made to expire simultaneously with such existing franchises, and every such
extension shall be considered a part of the property of the utility, shall be
operated as such and shall be subject to all the provisions of the original
grant, including the right of the City to acquire the property of the utility
by purchase or lease or by any of the means prescribed by this Charter or by
law.
SECTION 111.   PURCHASE OR LEASE BY CITY
   No grant of franchise and no renewal, extension or amendment of such grant
shall be valid unless it specifically reserves to the City the right, at
intervals to be set forth in the franchise ordinance, to terminate the same by
purchase or lease and operations of the property of the utility used in or
conveniently useful for the operation of the utility in the streets of the City
or elsewhere; nor shall any such grant, renewal or extension be valid which
does not either definitely fix and determine the price which shall be paid by
the City for the property of the public utility and the terms of payment in the
event of purchase or lease by the City, or provide the precise means and
methods whereby such purchase or rental price and terms shall be fixed and
determined.
SECTION 112.   CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS
   Nothing in such ordinance or in this Charter shall prevent the City from
acquiring the property of any utility by condemnation proceedings or any other
method provided by law; but such methods of acquisition shall be in addition to
the power of purchase or lease to be reserved in the grant, renewal or
extension.
SECTION 113.   REVISION OF RATES
   All grants of franchises and all renewals of extensions shall provide for a
revision of rates at specified intervals, and no such grants, renewals or
extensions shall be valid which permit rates to continue for a period of more
than five years without being subject to revision.
SECTION 114.   PRICE TO EXCLUDE FRANCHISE VALUE

shall be valid unless it shall expressly provide therein that the price to be
paid by the City for the property that may be acquired by it from such utility
by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, shall exclude all value of such grant,
extension or renewal, and unless it shall expressly provide therein that the
rental price to be paid by the City shall exclude all value of such grant,
renewal or extension.
SECTION 115.   GRANTS NOT INCLUDED
   Revocable permits for laying spur tracks across or along streets, alleys or

conditions as the Council may by ordinance prescribe.

which the records and accounts of the public utility shall be kept; and the
right to audit, examine and keep copies of such records and accounts and to
require from said utility detailed reports at any time relating to the
finances, operation, management and ownership of such utility; provided,
however, that the form of accounts which the State Public Utilities Commission
may prescribe shall be controlling insofar as they may apply, but the Council
may prescribe more detailed forms and exact more comprehensive reports than is
required or stipulated by said State Commission; nor shall any such franchise,
grant, renewal, extension or amendment be valid which does not reserve to the
City the right to establish standards of service, prevent unjust discrimination
in service or rates, require adequate extension of plant, equipment and
service.
SECTION 117.   REGULATIONS
   The Council shall at all times control the distribution of space in, over,
under or across all streets or public grounds occupied by public utility
fixtures. All rights granted for the construction and operation of public
utilities shall be subject to the continuing right of the Council to require
such reconstruction, relocation, change or discontinuance of the appliances
used by the utility in the streets, alleys, avenues and highways of the City as
shall in the opinion of the Council be necessary in the public interest. The
Council may make and enforce any and all other regulations conducive to the
safety, convenience and well-being of the public.
SECTION 118.   FORFEITURE
   If any action shall be instituted or prosecuted directly or indirectly by
the grantee of any such grant, or by its stockholders or creditors, to set
aside or have declared void any of the terms of any such grant, the whole of
such grant may be thereupon forfeited and annulled at the option of the Council
to be expressed by ordinance. All such grants shall make provision for the
declaration of a forfeiture by the Council for the violation by the grantee of
any of the terms thereof.

proposed amendment, prepared and filed with the Council, through its Clerk in
the manner and form prescribed in this Charter for the preparation and filing
with the Clerk of an initiative petition for an ordinance, such proposed
amendment shall be submitted to the electors of the City by the Council. When
ten (10) days and two regular meetings of the Council have passed after the
filing of a petition fulfilling the requirements of this section, then the
Council shall forthwith provide by ordinance for the submission to the electors
of the proposed amendment to this Charter. The ordinance providing for the

amendment be submitted to the electors at a primary or general election on the
day designated by State law and said ordinance shall be passed not less than
sixty (60) days prior to the day on which said election is to be held, except

election when authorized by two-thirds vote of the Council. Such special
election shall be held not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the passage of the ordinance providing for the
submission of the proposed amendment. The Clerk of the Council shall transmit
to the election authorities prescribed by general law a duly authenticated copy
of such ordinance forthwith upon its passage. The Clerk of the Council shall
give notice of such proposed amendments to the Charter in one of the following

therein.
   The full text of the proposed Charter amendment shall be published once a
week for not less than two consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the
Municipal corporation, with the first publication being at least fifteen days
prior to the election at which the amendment is to be submitted to the
electors. If no newspaper is published in the Municipal corporation, then such
publication shall be made in a newspaper of general circulation with the
Municipal corporation.
   If such proposed amendment is approved by a majority of the electors voting
thereon it shall become a part of the Charter of the City at the time fixed in
the amendment; and if no time is fixed therein, then it shall become a part of
the Charter upon its approval by the electors. Proposed amendments to this
Charter may be submitted to the electors by ballot title, which shall be clear,
concise statements, without argument, descriptive of the substance of such
proposed amendments. If conflicting proposed amendments to this Charter shall

in an even numbered year or at an election held in odd numbered year on a day

purchasing procedures with regards to quotes or bids must be followed when
applicable.Typical uses for blanket purchase orders include recurring invoices
such as utility bills, service contracts and other contracted services that
result in multiple invoices. Blanket purchase orders must be closed at the end
of every fiscal year per the Ohio Revised Code.
   (L)   SALE, TRADE-IN OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY: The Mayor shall
conduct all sales of real or personal property which the council may authorize
to be sold as having become unnecessary or unfit for the City’s use. The Mayor
shall choose the method of sale at his discretion. Any employee may only
purchase items for sale from an auction or bidding process.
   (M)   EQUIPMENT LEASES: The total dollar amount of lease will determine its
threshold of accountability. It must meet the criteria of the purchasing policy
based upon dollar amounts. (Over $15,000 needs council approval).
   (N)   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: Related party transactions shall be
governed according to
Section 85 of the City of Lima Charter.
   (O)   FIXED ASSET POLICY: The City’s current capital asset policy considers
any item with a cost of $2,500 or greater and a useful life of greater than one
year as a capital asset. Any purchase meeting these criteria should be charged
to a capital account.Capital accounts are those accounts where the object
portion of the number begins with 58 (ex. XXX-XXXX-58XXX-XXXX-XXX).
   (P)   EMERGENCIES: Emergency contracts for the operation and maintenance of
any municipal government are authorized by section 735.051 of the Ohio Revised
Code. These contracts must be for a real and present emergency. Any emergency
expenditure $15,000 or above must be approved by a two-thirds vote of city
council at their next regular scheduled meeting. These contracts do not require
sealed competitive bids secured by advertising and they may be granted to the
vendor based upon ability to immediately supply the items or do what is
required by the emergency.  In emergency situations, when obtaining written
quotations would result in an unusual delay and therefore cause a hardship for
the citizens of Lima, verbal quotations may be accepted. These verbal
quotations must be properly documented to show the name of the vendor and the
individual making the quotation. Payment of any invoices will not be authorized
until written confirmation of the quotation is received by the city.
   (Q)   OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
      (1)   It is the Department Head’s responsibility to approve all Purchase
Orders and Invoices and to ascertain that all items are received as ordered
prior to submitting invoices for payment.
      (2)   There shall be no “split” Purchase Orders or Invoices as a means to
circumvent dollar ceilings per our purchasing policy.
      (3)   There shall be no purchase of any items or service above $1,500
without a Purchase Order.
      (4)   No Purchase Order or Invoice may be changed after going through the
approval processwithout prior authorization from the purchasing department and
the department head placing the order.
      (5)   Periodic checks of suppliers who are used on a regular basis should
be made to ascertain that their quality and pricing are still the best value
for the city of Lima.
      (6)   All invoices shall be processed quickly to avoid the loss of
discounts or penalties for late payment.
      (7)   Local contractors or bidders should be used whenever possible if
they meet all the conditions of this policy.
      (8)   The City of Lima may not do business with any supplier that has a
delinquent tax liability or lien.
      (9)   If an item is available from only one supplier, the department
requesting the item must be able to support this in writing as a “sole source
item”.
   (R)   EXCEPTIONS: For any sale or purchase, exceptions may be made to any
provision of this policy, and different procedures or terms may be utilized if
approved by Council as being in the best interests of the City.

234.06   ESTABLISHMENT OF A FIFTY-SIX HOUR WEEK.

not less than three platoons and to operate the Department as a three-platoon

(Ord. 276-12. Passed 12-17-12.)
234.07   UNIFORM FUNDS.
   (a)   Uniform Account; Establishment and Purpose. There is hereby
established a Uniform Account for the members of the Fire Department for the
purpose of allocating money for the purchase of uniforms and clothing for
Department members required to wear the same in the line of duty. The Uniform
Account shall be placed under the supervision of the City Auditor and disbursed
under his direction in the manner herein stipulated.
   (b)   Use of Account. The Uniform Account shall be used for the sole purpose
of purchasing various items of official uniforms and clothing required to be
worn by Fire Department members, which items of uniforms and clothing so
purchased shall at all times remain the property of the City.
   (c)   Uniform Emergency Replacement Account. In the event that a uniform or
portion of a uniform worn by a member of the Fire Department is damaged beyond
repair or destroyed while a Fire Department member is engaged in performing a
particular assignment in the line of duty, then upon special application by
such member, approved by the Fire Chief and by the Mayor, the City Auditor is
authorized to disburse from a special account, known as the Uniform Emergency
Replacement Account, a sufficient sum of money to be applied by the City toward
the purchase of wearing apparel and uniforms to replace the articles of
clothing so damaged or destroyed. In order to authorize the purchase of such
apparel from the Uniform Emergency Replacement Account the City Auditor shall
be satisfied that such application is within the scope of the provisions of
this section and that such expenditure is not required because of reasonable
wear and tear experienced by the Fire Department member with respect to such
clothing but is in fact required as a result of unforeseen and extraordinary
circumstances.
   (d)   Records. The City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to keep a
separate ledger account of each individual member of the Fire Department,
disclosing the amount made available for the purchase of clothing by action of
Council, as the same may be amended from time to time, the items of clothing
and apparel purchased for such member by the City, the date of the order, the
date of the delivery of the clothing, the cost thereof and such other
information as the City Auditor may deem advisable or necessary.
   The City Auditor is further authorized and directed to make any additional
regulations necessary for the purpose of properly administering the provisions
of this section.
   (e)   Control of Funds by Council. Council shall appropriate from year to
year an amount sufficient to cover the requirements of the Fire Department by
reason of the amounts allocated to each individual member in the manner herein
set forth and shall furthermore appropriate such amount of money as may be
deemed advisable to be placed in the Uniform Emergency Replacement Account
provided for in subsection (e) hereof. No individual Fire Department member
shall have a vested right in any amount of money allocated in the manner herein
set forth, and, upon severance of his connection with the Department, whether
such severance is by voluntary act of the member, by action of the appointing
authority or by death, any unused amount of money for such purpose shall be
retained by the City and shall revert to the General Fund.

to the scene of the fire shall be made only upon the authority of the Fire

is justified.

shall be determined by the Fire Chief to the property of the applicant.
   The contract shall in no event confer a right of action for damages on any
property owner or any other person, township trustees, groups of persons, firms

will not establish any fire houses or fixed equipment outside of the City
limits.
   The period of such contract shall not exceed three years.
(Ord. 230-71. Passed 10-11-71.)
234.12   CITY'S RIGHT TO FIRE PROTECTION.

contract made hereunder, shall the City be required to furnish any fire
protection which cannot be reasonably spared from the fire-fighting force
necessary to protect the City; it shall be understood at all times that any
service required to be performed hereunder shall be secondary to the
requirements of the City and its residents. If, at the time of any call from
the township trustees or other property owners under contract for the

answering fire calls within the City, the call from such township or property
owner under contract may be postponed until such equipment, apparatus and

of real estate and personal property, multiplied by .5 mill for a low risk
factor; for a medium risk factor, the fee shall be calculated at 1.0 mill; and
for a high risk factor, the fee shall be calculated at 1.5 mills. Risk factor

payable semiannually in advance, and unless paid within thirty days from the
submission of the statement, the City shall be entitled to withhold or
terminate any fire protection service authorized by such contract. The Mayor
may require the initial semiannual payment to be made at the execution of the
contract and prior to the time such fire protection services are required to
begin. There will be a charge of two thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500)

(Ord. 138-83.  Passed 7-25-83.)
244.06   LEAVES OF ABSENCE FOR MILITARY SERVICE; COMPENSATION AND HEALTH CARE
BENEFITS.

      (1)   Each City officer and employee who is a member of the Ohio National
Guard, the Ohio State Guard, the Ohio Naval Militia or any other reserve
component of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be entitled to leaves
of absence from employment  duties for the time such person is in military
service, on field training, or on active duty, for periods not exceeding thirty
days in any calendar year.
      (2)   Any City officer or employee on military leave of absence shall be
entitled to receive pay in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining
agreement, state or federal law.
      (3)   An officer or employee returning from extended military leave,
which shall be defined herein as being greater than 30 calendar days, will

      (4)   An officer or employee returning from extended military leave who
has not been promoted because of being on active military service will receive
promotion upon return in accordance with USERRA, the City Charter, a relevant
collective bargaining agreement, and City ordinance.  Classified civil service
employees must appear on an eligibility list at the time of promotion
opportunity to be eligible for promotion upon return.  Being on an eligibility
list does not guarantee promotion, the person returning from extended military
leave will only be eligible for promotion if the sole reason the person was not
promoted was due to the absence for active military service.       
   (B)   Group Health Care Benefits. For officers or  employees on extended
military leave, health care benefits will terminate on the last day of the
month in which the officer or employee last receives pay from the City of
Lima.  As defined by Federal Law, while on extended military leave, an officer
or employee and their family members will have access to health care without
cost through the military’s health care delivery system.  However, officers or
employees eligible for extended military leave will also have options available
for a 24 month period for providing health care benefit coverage for their
qualified dependents during the period of extended military leave as follows:
      (1)   Continue their health coverage at 102 percent of the full premium
rate in accordance with Federal Law.   
      (2)   Continue their health coverage at the normal full-time employee
contribution rate payable by the first of the month that the coverage will be
provided.  Coverage will be as defined in the City’s health plan document. 
      (3)   Discontinue health care benefit coverage and receive mileage
reimbursement for travel to out-of-county Tri-Care Prime providers for health
care services that are covered under the City’s health plan.  The rate of
reimbursement will be the standard mileage rate as determined by the Auditor’s
office.  The Human Resource Department will be responsible for verifying that a
trip qualifies for reimbursement.  Requests for reimbursement must include
proof of a visit to an out-of-county Tri-Care Prime provider and must be
submitted within 60 days of the visit.

on which death occurs.

but less than two years;

years but less than twenty-five years;
      (5)   Five work weeks vacation to all employees who have worked twenty-
five years or more.
   (C)   In addition, each employee who has accumulated more than ninety days
sick leave shall receive one additional day of vacation for each three days of
unused sick leave accumulated during the preceding year in excess of ninety
days, but not in excess of 105 days, or at the option of the employee, he shall
be paid his normal rate of pay for such time. Such vacation time or payment in
lieu thereof shall be charged against the employee's accumulated sick leave.
Employees shall also have the option to take none of the above and accrue the
time as sick leave.
   (D)   Each classified employee who has been previously employed by the City
with an interruption in his term of service not exceeding five years for
whatever reason, shall be entitled to a credit for such prior service for
purposes of computing vacation time and accumulated sick leave only.
   (E)   Prior service shall mean service within the classified service of the
City, irrespective of whether such service was within a safety division, under
the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), or as a result of any
other program. Prior service shall not mean service within the unclassified
service as an elected official or as part-time, temporary or seasonal employee
of the City. Subsections (c) and (e) hereof shall not apply to retired
employees who are rehired by the City.
   (F)   Vacations shall be taken at such times as are authorized by the
employee's department head. If an employee is unable to receive his vacation
due to work requirements, he may accumulate and carry over unused vacation time
for a period not to exceed three years, or, upon authorization of the
appointing authority, shall be paid for unused time at his normal rate of pay.
Effective January 1, 1986, the above three years shall be reduced to one year,
except for the Police Chief, the Fire Chief, Police Inspectors and Assistant
Fire Chiefs.
   (G)   Vacation may be taken within the year in which an anniversary falls
for additional vacation. If an employee should terminate City employment before
the anniversary date upon which vacation is accumulated, any unaccumulated
vacation time will be deducted from his final paycheck.
   (H)   Divisional seniority, within classification, will be used for the
purpose of vacation scheduling. This will allow the employee with the most
seniority a preference in the time of year he will use his vacation time.
Vacation requests must be submitted prior to April 15. This schedule must be
approved by the employee's department head. No employee will have a choice of
more than two weeks vacation unless he uses all of his vacation consecutively.
After all requests have been scheduled, further requests will be processed, as
above, until April 30. All remaining vacation time will be assigned by the
department head.

   (A)   The first five steps of the pay ranges shall be interpreted as
follows:
      (1)   Step A is the minimum rate and shall normally be the hiring rate
for the class. In cases where it is difficult to secure qualified personnel,
the appointing authority, with the authorization of the Civil Service Board and
Council, may hire at Step B or C.
      (2)   Step B is an incentive advancement to encourage an employee to
improve his work. Employees shall be advanced to Step B at the beginning of the
pay period following the completion of six months of satisfactory service.
      (3)   Step C represents the middle value of the salary range and is the
rate at which a fully qualified, experienced and conscientious employee may
expect to be paid after a reasonable period of satisfactory service. An
employee shall be advanced to Step C at the beginning of the pay period after
the completion of 18 months of service in the class. After one year at Step B,
an employee may be advanced to Step C, provided that the advancement is
recommended by the appointing authority and approved by the Civil Service
Board.
      (4)   Step D is to reward employees who have completed long service with
the City. An employee shall be advanced to Step D at the beginning of the pay
period after the completion of thirty-six months of service in the class.
      (5)   Step E is to reward employees who have completed longer service
with the City. An employee shall be advanced to Step E at the beginning of the
pay period after the completion of sixty months of service in the class.
   (B)   In any case where, by reason of unusual circumstances, rigid adherence
to the foregoing principles relating to salary adjustments would cause a
manifest injustice, Council, on recommendation of the Civil Service Board, may
make such order relating thereto as ln its discretion is proper.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, an employee
who is promoted or reclassified from one class to another, which has a higher
or overlapping salary range, shall be placed in Step A of the new range or in a
step above his or her old salary, whichever is higher.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, an employee
who is promoted from one class to another shall advance to the next pay step
upon the completion of six months ln the pay step established pursuant to
subsection (C) hereof.  Thereafter, the employee shall again advance to the
next pay steps after successive completion of the required time periods.
   (E)   When one employee continuously occupies two or more positions
concurrently, the highest salary range provided for one of the positions
occupied shall be the appropriate range for determining the total compensation.
   (F)   For purposes of this section, employees who have resigned and are
subsequently duly reinstated shall be considered, for pay purposes, the same as
original appointees. Employees separated from the service because of injury or
physical disability and subsequently duly reinstated to the same or similar
positions and employees laid off because of shortage of funds or work and
subsequently re-employed shall be given credit for previous service.

or to remove or cause to be removed any vehicle from a public street or

circumstances:
      (1)   When any vehicle is left unattended, parked or abandoned upon any

      (2)   When any vehicle is left unattended upon any public way or in any
public grounds or any public park where such vehicle constitutes an obstruction
to traffic;

such officer, by any person designated by the Mayor as City Vehicle Pound
custodian, his agents or servants, from any public way or from any public park
by towing or otherwise to the City Vehicle Pound, where the same shall be kept
and detained until the owner, chauffeur, driver or other person in charge of
such vehicle secures a written order from the Chief of Police or any member of
the Police Department designated by him or her, authorizing that such vehicle
be released from the City Vehicle Pound.
   (d)   Removal of vehicle at owner's risk; costs. The removal by a police
officer or other authorized person of any vehicle subject to the provisions of

state traffic law.
   (f)   Removal service charge.
      (1)   No vehicle impounded under the provisions of this chapter shall be

vehicles impounded, which records shall also contain information concerning the

time when such vehicle is released and other data pertinent thereto. Such
records shall be kept for a period of one year from the date of the
impoundment.
   (g)   Failure to reclaim vehicle.  If, at the expiration of ten days after
any vehicle has been impounded, the owner, chauffeur, driver or other person in
charge thereof has not appeared at the Police Department to claim the vehicle,
the Chief of Police shall immediately cause a search to be made of the records
of the State Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the owner and any lienholder
of such motor vehicle, and, if known, shall send notice to such owner and
lienholder at his last known address by certified mail, return receipt
requested, that the motor vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of
if not claimed within ten days of the date of mailing of the notice. When any
owner, chauffeur, driver or other person in charge of the vehicle impounded
presents himself at the Police Department to claim his vehicle, he shall
furnish satisfactory proof of his right and title thereto to the person in
charge.
   (h)   Protest against paying fees.
      (1)   In case protest against the payment of such fees is made by the
claimant under oath, denying any violation charged to him, there shall be given
to him by the person in charge at the Police Department a release form marked
"paid Under Protest," which, together with the proper fees, shall be presented
to the City Vehicle Pound custodian, or filed with the Lima Police Department
in the case of the use of a "Texas Boot". It shall thereupon be the duty of the
officer having knowledge of the facts to forthwith file or cause to be filed an
affidavit in the Lima Municipal Court charging the owner, chauffeur, driver or
other person in charge of such vehicle with a violation of a provision of this
Traffic Code if such violation is claimed.
      (2)   If such person is subsequently found not guilty by the trial court
of committing the violation on account of which the vehicle of such person was
impounded, it shall thereupon be the duty of the Police Department to notify
the City Vehicle Pound custodian of such fact. Any fees and charges so paid
under protest shall be refunded by the City Vehicle Pound custodian, or the
City of Lima in the case of the use of a "Texas Boot".
      (3)   If at any time it appears to the Chief of Police that such vehicle
was erroneously impounded, such official shall be authorized to order the
immediate release of such vehicle without requiring the payment of such charge
and, when appropriate, he shall notify in writing the City Vehicle Pound
custodian of such action and the reason therefor.
   (i)   Unclaimed vehicles.  Whenever any vehicle impounded under the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances is unclaimed for a period of 30 days by
any person having the right of possession to such vehicle, the Chief of Police
shall dispose of any such vehicle to a junk yard, scrap metal processing
facility or any facility under contract with the City for the disposal of such
motor vehicle, if such vehicle has a fair market value of $200 or less. Any
such vehicle which has a fair market value of more than $200 shall be sold
under the direction of the Chief of Police at public auction to the highest
bidder after notice of such auction has been advertised by publication once a
week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City. Any moneys accruing from the disposal of any unclaimed motor vehicle, in
excess of the expenses resulting from removal and storage of such vehicle,
shall be credited to the General Fund of the City.

committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing
factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written
plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation,
or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the
fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted
driving safety course, the duration and contents of which shall be established

completes the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the
offender successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to
pay the total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not
be required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so
long as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full
and such written evidence.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty

§ 414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more state routes that are through highways intersect, and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever the
Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop traffic on a
through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prevent the installations. When circumstances warrant, the
Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways
under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes a
stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30 days before
installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate the street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting the through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(R.C. § 4511.65)

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of- way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.

are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane- use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.

“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-paramedic,  or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for
the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite
of a controlled substance, or combination content of the whole blood, blood
serum or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath
or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division
may refuse to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion,
the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of
blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. §
3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic,  or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
            “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
            “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under state or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for state O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
            (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
            “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.
(R.C. § 4511.191(D))

violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle
while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for
either offense under R.C. Chapter 2929, except as otherwise authorized or
required by divisions (h)(1)A. through (h)(1)E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)
(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of division (a) or (b) of this
section, or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in R.C. §
4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under R.C. §

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,

         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by R.C.
§ 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3).
      (4)   If an offender’s driver’s or occupational driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or R.C. § 4511.19(G) and if R.C. § 4510.13 permits the court to
grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(5).
      (6)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under division (h)(1)C., (h)(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section is
assigned or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in
addition to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to §
698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for
any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under division
(h) of this section.
      (8)   A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency
for any costs incurred by the agency with respect to a chemical test or tests
administered to the offender if all of the following apply:
         A.   The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section.
         B.   The test or tests were of the offender’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine.
         C.   The test or tests indicated that the offender had a prohibited
concentration of a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in the offender’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine at the
time of the offense.
      (9)   As used in division (h) of this section, “electronic monitoring”
has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2929.01.
   (i)   Penalty for operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption.
Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited
driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any jail term
imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
or (b) of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction
imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction

specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(4).  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021 and 4510.13.
      (3)   If the offender also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1416 and if the court
imposes a jail term for the violation of division (b) of this section, the
court shall impose upon the offender an additional definite jail term pursuant
to R.C. § 2929.24(E).
      (4)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (b) of this section.

Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (k)   Appeal; effect on suspension. If a person whose driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.
   (l)   Exception; direction of health professional. Division (a)(1)J. of this
section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or
urine that equals or exceeds the amount specified in that division, if both of
the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   Applicability to R.C. § 2923.16(D). The prohibited concentrations of a
controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance listed in
division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for
a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or
urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in division (a)(1)J.
of this section.
      (3)   Field sobriety test.
         A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a

field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (o)(3)A.1. or (o)(3)A.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         B.   Division (o)(3)A. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on
the offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02
(A)(7).
      (5)   Exception. Division (o)(2)C. of this section does not apply to a

§ 434.04  MAXIMUM SPEED LIMITS; ASSURED CLEAR DISTANCE AHEAD.
   (a)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or
streetcar at a speed greater or less than is reasonable or proper, having due
regard to the traffic, surface, and width of the street or highway and any

trolley, or streetcar in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed than
will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear distance
ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local
authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or
streetcar to operate the same at a speed not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected; except
that, on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (b)(4) of this section and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section. The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section
or in the manual and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control
devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section and in R.C. § 4511.212, "school" means
any school chartered under R.C. § 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that
during the preceding year filed with the Department of Education in compliance
with rule 3301-35-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code, a copy of the school's
report for the parents of the school's pupils certifying that the school meets
Ohio minimum standards for nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents
evidence of this filing to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the
establishment of a school zone. "School" also includes a special elementary
school that in writing requests the county engineer of the county in which the
special elementary school is located to create a school zone at the location of
that school. Upon receipt of such a written request, the county engineer shall
create a school zone at that location by erecting the appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway, and also includes that portion of a state highway. Upon request from
local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a state highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a county engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1., 2., and 3. of this
section shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
               Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and C. of this section.
         D.   As used in this division, "crosswalk" has the meaning given that
term in division (LL)(2) of R.C. § 4511.01.  The Director may, upon request by
resolution of the legislative authority of a municipal corporation, the board
of trustees of a township, or a county board of developmental disabilities
created pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5126, and upon submission by the municipal
corporation, township, or county board of such engineering, traffic, and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a state route lying within the municipal corporation, lying within
the unincorporated territory of the township, or lying adjacent to the property
of a school that is operated by such county board, that includes a crosswalk
customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during recess and
opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a straight
line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the nearest point
of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone shall include
the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet on each
approach direction of the state route.
         E.   As used in this section, "special elementary school" means a
school that meets all of the following criteria:
            1.   It is not chartered and does not receive tax revenue from any
source.
            2.   It does not educate children beyond the eighth grade.
            3.   It is located outside the limits of a municipal corporation.
            4.   A majority of the total number of students enrolled at the
school are not related by blood.
            5.   The principal or other person in charge of the special
elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

corporation, except on state routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts, and alleys;

determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer's view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose

been or is being committed.
   (f)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat, or an occupant restraining device as

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.

division (b)(3) of this section is wearing all of the available elements of a
properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
      (3)   Occupy, as a passenger, a seating position on the front seat of an

   (d)   Officers not permitted to stop cars to determine violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for the violation or

      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
$30.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject

division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

§ 440.01  LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   For regional trips at distances of 150 miles or less from a
facility stated on the application as the applicant’s point of origin.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the

of this section shall fail to properly mark the special parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the special
locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or movable

§ 452.05  WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified
by the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper. If the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper determines that the
vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the Sheriff,
Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.
   (b)   If the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper

motor vehicle to the location designated by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not
more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall cause a search to be made
of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff
or Chief of Police, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left
on private residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property. The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or

or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process unless reasonable diligence is
exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
§ 606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are “involuntary acts.”
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 606.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 606.09  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 606.10  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C. §
2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by the organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in that
conduct, or tolerates that conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and the duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 606.11  ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   (1)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit
an offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
      (2)   In addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to division (e)
(1) of this section for an attempt to commit aggravated murder or murder in
violation of division (a) of this section, if the offender used a motor vehicle
as the means to attempt to commit the offense, the court shall impose upon the
offender a class two suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or
nonresident operating privilege as specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(2).
      (3)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to attempted rape and
also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1418, 2941.1419 or 2941.1420, the offender shall be sentenced to
a prison term or term of life imprisonment pursuant to R.C. § 2971.03.
   (f)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
§ 606.12  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
§ 606.13  SELF DEFENSE; LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” and “vehicle” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.

§ 618.01  AUTHORITY; FINDINGS.
   (a)   The provisions in this chapter are enacted pursuant to the City of
Lima's home-rule authority under Ohio Constitution Article XVII, Section 3
(Home Rule), R.C. § 955.221(B)(3), Section 1 of the Charter of the City of
Lima, and the ruling of the Ohio Supreme Court that the Ohio General Assembly
may not by statute prohibit the municipal home-rule authority granted by
Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.  See City of Cleveland v.
State, 138 Ohio St. 3d 232 (Ohio 2014) (Syllabus 1).
   (b)   In addition to the authority in division (a) of this section, with
respect to §
618.08 set forth below, while the laws of the State of Ohio as set forth in
R.C. § 955.11 establish regulations and controls on vicious, dangerous, and
nuisance dogs after a bite or aggressive action has occurred, Council desires
to enact §
618.08 to supplement an unregulated area of the Ohio Revised Code to provide
for regulation of pit bull dogs prior to a bite or aggressive action taking
place, as a means to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of
and visitors to the City. 
      (1)   Council finds and determines that in 2013 in Lima there were
approximately 97 reported dog bites and 29% of those were from pit bull dogs,
and that in 2012 approximately 39% of the dog bites by reported breed in Lima
were attributed to pit bull dogs; and,
      (2)   Council finds that it is in the best interests of the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens and visitors of the City of Lima to enact §
618.08 pursuant to the City's Home Rule Authority to provide specific
regulations regarding pit bull dogs inside the City.  Council finds this
section is a reasonable control on the unrestrained activities of pit bull dogs
to protect the health, safety, welfare, and pleasantness of the use of streets,
parks, sidewalks, yards and all other areas of the City by citizens and
visitors.  In making these findings Council adopts and affirms the  evidence
and findings set forth in the Ohio Supreme Court case of City of Toledo v.
Tellings, 114 Ohio St. 3d 278, 282-283 (Ohio 2007).
   (c)   As further authority and findings in support of all provisions in this
chapter (specifically including but not limited to §

set forth in Ordinance 134-14 amending this chapter, and the information
presented to Council through its Safety Services Committee Reports related to

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

graffiti and be capable of allowing a finished surface which is to be completed
by the property owner.  If the Chief of Police provides for the removal or

wound treated or observed by the person, or any serious physical harm to
persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.
   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.

report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding R.C. §
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (e) of this section.

advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for
excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.

relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under R.C. § 2739.04 or 2739.12.
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to disclosure by a
member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to him or her in his or her capacity as such by a person
seeking his or her aid or counsel.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in danger of
drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,
clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider whose alcohol
and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. § 5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are violations of
R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.05, or to victims of felonious sexual penetration in
violation of former R.C. § 2907.12. As used in this division, “counseling
services” include services provided in an informal setting by a person who, by
education or experience, is competent to provide those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (i)   Whoever violates division (a) or (b) of this section is guilty of
failure to report a crime. Violation of division (a)(1) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Violation of division (a)(2) or (b) of this
section is a misdemeanor of the second degree.

within the public official’s official capacity, shall do any act that hampers
or impedes a public official in the performance of the public official’s lawful
duties.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of obstructing official
business. Except as otherwise provided in this division, obstructing official
business is a misdemeanor of the second degree. If a violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, obstructing official business is
a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,
is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty to or is adjudicated a
delinquent child for committing the crime or act the person or child aided
committed. The crime or act the person or child aided committed shall be used
under division (c) of this section in determining the penalty for violation of

ultimately is apprehended for, is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty
to or is adjudicated a delinquent child for committing the crime or act the

(R.C. § 2913.51)
§ 672.03  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), 2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04,
2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in the
offender’s same employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those
offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a series of offenses under
R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance
to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall
be tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by
R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved
in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43,
whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a
victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed against one
victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active duty
service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value as required by R.C.
§ 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in
all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
the property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
“fair market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(R.C. § 2913.61(B) - (E))
§ 672.04  DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of §
672.01 or
672.02 is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the property
involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its
face identifies the drawer or maker for whose use it is designed or identifies
the account on which it is to be drawn, and that has not been executed by the
drawer or maker or on which the amount is blank;
   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.22, a temporary license placard or windshield sticker as prescribed by
R.C. § 4503.182, or any comparable license plate, placard, or sticker as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;
   (d)   A blank form for a certificate of title or a manufacturer’s or
importer’s certificate to a motor vehicle, as prescribed by R.C. § 4505.07;
   (e)   A blank form for any license listed in R.C. § 4507.01.

§ 672.05  EVIDENCE OF THEFT OF RENTED PROPERTY.
   (a)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply

      (1)   “Rentee.” A person who pays consideration to a renter for the use
of rented property.
      (2)   “Renter.” A person who owns rented property.

      (1)   At the time of entering into the rental contract, the rentee
presented the renter with identification that was materially false, fictitious
or not current with respect to name, address, place of employment or other
relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.
(R.C. § 2913.72)
§ 672.06  TAMPERING WITH COIN MACHINES.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit theft or to defraud, shall knowingly
enter, force an entrance into, tamper with or insert any part of an instrument
into any coin machine.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of tampering with coin
machines, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the offender previously has
been convicted of a violation of this section or of any theft offense as
defined in R.C. § 2913.01, tampering with coin machines is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.

that involves alleged tampering with a gas, electric, steam or water meter,
conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the utility,
proof that a meter, conduit or attachment of a utility has been tampered with
is prima facie evidence that the person who is obligated to pay for the service
rendered through the meter, conduit or attachment, and who is in possession or
control of the meter, conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred
has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in R.C. § 2913.01,
that involves the alleged reconnection of a gas, electric, steam or water
meter, conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the
utility, proof that a meter, conduit or attachment disconnected by a utility
has been reconnected without the consent of the utility is prima facie evidence
that the person in possession or control of the meter, conduit or attachment at
the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment
with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (c)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

      (2)   “Utility.” Any electric light company, gas company, natural gas

receivers, and each similar utility owned or operated by a political
subdivision, shall notify its customers, on an annual basis, that tampering
with or bypassing a meter constitutes a theft offense that could result in the
imposition of criminal sanctions.

(a)(2) of this section or any substantially equivalent state law or municipal
ordinance, the person is guilty of a minor misdemeanor;

division (a)(2) of this section or any substantially equivalent state law or
municipal ordinance, or convicted of or pleaded guilty to any offense of
violence, if the weapon involved is a firearm that is either loaded or for
which the offender has ammunition ready at hand, or if the weapon involved is a
dangerous ordnance, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree.

regarding a possible violation of this section, for a traffic stop, or for any
other law enforcement purpose, if the person surrenders a firearm to the
officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the officer,
and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section
or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by
law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer
shall return the firearm to the person at the termination of the stop. If a

one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as

subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or

(R.C. § 2935.36(E))
§ 698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (g) of this section or R.C. § 2929.23,
and unless  another penalty is otherwise expressly provided in the section of
which the provision is a part, whoever violates any of the provisions of this
Part Six - General Offenses Code, other than a minor misdemeanor, shall be
imprisoned for a definite term or fined, or both, which term of imprisonment
and fine shall be fixed by the court as provided in this section.
   Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to committing, attempting to commit
or complicity in committing a violation of Section
642.06 or

is caused by the offense and for all or part of the value of the property that
is the subject of any theft offense, as defined in §
642.01, that the person committed. If the court determines that the victim of
the offense was 65 years of age or older or permanently or totally disabled at
the time of the commission of the offense, the court, regardless of whether or
not the offender knew the age of the victim, shall consider this fact in favor
of imposing restitution, but this fact shall not control the decision of the
court.
   (f)   If a person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment pursuant to this
section and the term of imprisonment is to be served in a county jail, in a
county that has established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. §
5147.30, the court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the person
may be considered by the county sheriff of that county for participation in the
county jail industry program.  The court shall retain jurisdiction to modify
its specification made pursuant to this division during the person's term of
imprisonment upon a reassessment of the person's qualifications for
participation in the program. 
   (g)   If an offender is being sentenced for a sexually oriented offense that
is a misdemeanor committed on or after the effective date of this amendment
(January 1, 1997) and if the judge imposing sentence for the sexually oriented
offense determines pursuant to R.C. § 2950.09(B) that the offender is a sexual
predator, the judge shall include in the offender's sentence a statement that
the offender has been adjudicated as being a sexual predator, shall comply with
the requirements of R.C. § 2950.03 and shall require the offender to submit to
a DNA specimen collection procedure pursuant to R.C. § 2901.07.
   (h)   Before imposing sentence on an offender who is being sentenced for a
sexually oriented offense that is a misdemeanor committed on or after the
effective date of this amendment (January 1, 1997), the judge shall conduct a
hearing in accordance with R.C. § 2950.09(B) to determine whether the offender
is a sexual predator. Before imposing sentence on an offender who is being
sentenced for a sexually oriented offense, the court also shall comply with
R.C. § 2950.09(E).
   (i)   If an offender is being sentenced for a sexually oriented offense that
is a misdemeanor committed on or after the effective date of this amendment
(January 1, 1997), the judge shall include in the sentence a summary of the
offender's duty to register pursuant to R.C. § 2950.04, the offender's duty to
provide notice of a change in residence address and register the new residence
address pursuant to R.C. § 2950.05, the offender's duty to periodically verify
the offender's current residence address pursuant to R.C. § 2950.06, and the
duration of the duties.  The judge shall inform the offender, at the time of
sentencing, of those duties and of their duration and, if required under R.C. §
2950.03(A)(2), shall perform the duties specified in that section.
(Ord. 151-05.  Passed 8-8-05.)
§ 698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in R.C. §§ 2929.21 and 2929.24 through 2929.28.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
666.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.21 and 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that
imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the
offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under R.C. §§ 2929.24 through
2929.28. The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary
burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
(b)(1)C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. § 2929.21.
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under R.C. § 2929.25 through
2929.28.  A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under R.C. §
2929.24 only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 and
2929.24 through 2929.28, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.10 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;

      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$1,000.
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
that penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.10, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(R.C. § 2929.31)
§ 698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.

shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term or sentence
of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the state, another
state or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this
section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be
served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony
served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08 or
4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional
institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 698.06  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 4510.07 or in any other provision of
the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this code of ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this code of ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
code of ordinances is substantially equivalent.

   (A)   Not sooner than forty-five nor later than sixty days after the end of
each calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a video service
provider fee to the City. The fee shall be calculated quarterly by determining
the provider's gross revenue for the preceding calendar quarter as described in
all of subsection (B) of this section and multiplying the result by three
percent (3%).
   (B)   Gross revenue shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
      (1)   Gross revenue shall consist of all of the following revenue for
the  calendar quarter that is collected by the provider for video service from
all its subscribers having service addresses within the City:
         (a)   Recurring monthly charges for video service;
         (b)   Event-based charges for video service, including, but not

charges.
         (f)   Advertising revenue. For these purposes, "advertising revenue"
means the net revenue received by the video service provider for advertising on
its subscription-based video service within the City. If such revenue is
derived under a regional or national compensation contract or arrangement
between the video service provider and one or more advertisers or advertising
representatives, the amount of revenue derived for the City shall be determined
by multiplying the total net revenue received by the video service provider
under the contract or arrangement by the percentage resulting from dividing the
number of subscribers in the City by the total number of regional or national
subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under the contract or
arrangement.
      (2)   Gross revenue shall not include any of the following:
         (a)   Any taxes, fees, or assessments that are collected by the video
service provider from video service subscribers for pass-through to any
federal, state, or local government agency, including the video service
provider fee authorized under this section, the fee authorized under division
(F) of section 1332.30 of the Revised Code, and the federal communication
commission user fee; 
         (b)   Uncollectible charges, except that uncollectible charges, all or
part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         (c)   Late payment charges;
         (d)   Maintenance charges;
         (e)   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in the
regular course of business or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated or
bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of
directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;
         (f)   Reimbursement by programmers of marketing costsactually incurred
by the video service provider;
         (g)   Any revenue not expressly enumerated in division (B)(1) of this
section.
      (C)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the City.
      (D)   (1)   At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar
year, the City or its designee may conduct an audit for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of a video service provider's calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to City in the audit period. For the purpose of
the audit, the video service provider shall make available for inspection, at
the location where such records are kept in the normal course of business,
those records pertaining to its gross revenue as defined in all of subsection
(B) of this section
809.02.
         (2)   A video service provider shall pay any amounts found to have
been underpaid in the audit within thirty days after notice and shall include
interest on the underpayment. However, payment need not be made in that thirty-
day period if the video service provider brings an action under subsection (3)
of this section, below.
         (3)   An action by the City or by the video service provider to
dispute the amount of video service provider fee due based on the audit results
may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction not later than two years
following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates.
(Ord. 10-08. Passed 01-08-08.)
809.03   VSP FEE NOTICE PROVISION.
   Upon receipt of notice from a VSP that it will begin providing Video Service
in the City pursuant to a state-issued video service authorization, the Mayor
shall provide such VSP with notice of the VSP Fee as set forth in this Chapter,
which notice shall be delivered in a manner that provides for proof of timely

unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such specific
sentence, clause, section, part or provision of this Chapter and shall not
affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections
or other parts or provision of this Chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the

   (A)   As used in this chapter, "Building Commissioner" means the duly
appointed and qualified Building Commissioner of the City as defined in the
Building Code.
   (B)   As used in this chapter, "courtesy benches" mean benches to be used by
pedestrians, which benches shall be decorative in nature and restricted to
fixed bus routes or other locations specifically designated by the Building
Commissioner, and shall not contain advertising except as provided for in this
chapter.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.02   INTENT.
   Courtesy benches for the convenience of local bus patrons and members of the
general public may be installed and maintained upon the public ways and
sidewalks of the City in the manner and subject to the conditions and
regulations prescribed by this chapter, and which also meet those
specifications on file with the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.03   PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall install or maintain any courtesy bench without first
obtaining a permit therefor from the Building Commissioner on forms prescribed
by the Commissioner.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.04   APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   An application for a permit shall be submitted to the Building Commissioner
and shall disclose the name and address of the applicant, the location of the
proposed courtesy bench or benches and any other information required by the
Commissioner. One application may be made for one or more benches and one
permit may be issued for one or more benches; however, a separate fee shall be
paid as stipulated in Section
812.05. An individual or legal entity may make application for no more than
twenty benches per year.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.05   FEES; REGULATIONS.
   Each application for a permit shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount
specified in Section
868.01 for each courtesy bench.  All permits shall expire at 12:00 midnight on

placed to the credit of the General Fund.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90; Ord. 176-17.  Passed 8-21-17.)
812.06   ISSUANCE OR DENIAL OF PERMITS.
   If the Building Commissioner finds that the applicant has complied with all
of the provisions of this chapter and that the maintenance of a bench or
benches at the proposed locations will not tend to obstruct passage or create a
hazard to persons traveling on the public way in the vicinity thereof, he may
issue a permit; otherwise, such application shall be denied. If the Building
Commissioner denies the application, he shall state the reasons therefor in
writing. Within ten days from the delivery of such notice, the applicant may
appeal to the Mayor concerning the Building Commissioner's decision.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.07   REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Any permit issued under authority of this chapter may be revoked by
the Building Commissioner for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Violation of any of the provisions of this chapter by the
permittee;
      (2)   Any fraud or misrepresentation by the permittee in the application;
      (3)   The failure of the permittee or applicant to maintain in full force
and effect the necessary indemnity bond or evidence of public liability
insurance, as required by this chapter, or
      (4)   When continued maintenance of a bench at a specified location is
deemed by the Commissioner to be hazardous to pedestrian and vehicular traffic
or prejudicial to the interest of the general public. In such event, revocation
shall be partial only and shall apply only to the bench involved. The fee paid
for such bench shall be refunded to the permittee.
   (B)   No revocation provided for in subsection (A) hereof shall be effective
until the Commissioner has conducted a hearing thereon. The Commissioner shall
give at least ten days notice of such hearing to the permittee and any other
interested persons. At the hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity
to be heard, in person or by counsel, to face his accusers and to examine and
cross-examine witnesses. The burden of proof shall be upon the City to show why
the permittee's permit should be revoked. The Commissioner shall make his
determination within five days of the hearing. The permittee may appeal the
Commissioner's determination pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2506.01 et seq.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.08   REMOVAL OF BENCH UPON REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   If the permittee does not remove a courtesy bench at the location for which
the permit has been revoked or if a courtesy bench is not removed upon the
expiration of any permit therefor without renewal thereof, the Building
Commissioner, after giving fifteen days notice thereof in writing mailed to the
address of the permittee designated in the application, may remove such bench
and charge the costs of the removal and storage thereof against the permittee.
The permittee may recover the bench if he pays such costs within thirty days
after such removal; otherwise, title to such bench shall vest in the City, and
the permittee's rights therein shall be forfeited.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.09   LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE OF BENCHES; SPECIFICATIONS.
   Courtesy benches shall conform to the following requirements:
   (A)   No bench shall be more than forty-two inches high, two feet six inches
wide and seven feet long.
   (B)   No more than two benches may be maintained at any one location without
a special finding of the Building Commissioner that the public convenience
requires more than two benches at such location. Benches shall be located only
along designated bus routes, or as specifically designated by the Building
Commissioner, and shall not be maintained on private property. The permittee
shall inspect each bench periodically and at least semimonthly, and submit a
written report of such inspection to the Building Commissioner.
   (C)   No bench shall be maintained in any alley or at any location where the
distance from the face of the curb to the property line is less than ten feet,
unless the Commissioner, in his written approval of the application, finds that
maintenance of a bench at such location is in the public interest. Each
courtesy bench shall be installed parallel with the curb and set back
approximately eighteen inches from the face of the curb, except as may be
otherwise permitted by the Commissioner, and each bench shall conform with the
requirements established by the Commissioner with respect to safety.  Benches
shall be kept at all times in a neat, clean and usable condition, and ice and
snow shall be removed from the benches and the vicinity thereof in such manner
that each bench is accessible at all times.
   (D)   The only form of advertising shall be commemorative plaques which may
contain language requested by the sponsor of a particular bench, and may be
displayed only on the rear surface of the back of the bench, and no Political,
obscene, immoral or indecent advertising or any words which might mislead or
distract pedestrian or vehicular traffic shall be permitted. Commemorative
plaques shall be no larger than five inches by seven inches in size.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)
812.10   BOND; INSURANCE.
   Before a permit for a courtesy bench is issued, the applicant shall post
with the City Auditor a bond or policy of public liability insurance approved
by the Director of Law and conditioned substantially as follows: that the
permittee will indemnify and save harmless the City and its officers, agents
and employees from any and all loss, costs, damages, expenses or liability
which may result from the granting of such permit for the installation and
maintenance of such bench and that the permittee will pay any and all loss or
damage which may be sustained by any person as a result of such installation or
maintenance.  The bond or policy of insurance shall be maintained in its
original amount by the permittee at his expense at all times during the period
for which the permit is in effect. In the event that two or more permits are
issued to one permittee, one bond or policy of insurance may be furnished to
cover two or more benches. Each bond or policy shall be of a type where
coverage is automatically restored after the occurrence of any accident or loss
from which liability may thereafter accrue.
   The limit of liability upon any bond or policy so posted shall in no case be
less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the death or injury
of one person, five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) total liability for
personal injury and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for property damage.
   Each bond shall be accompanied by good and sufficient sureties approved by
the Building Commissioner.
   The Commissioner shall notify the permittee of any claim of which the City
has notice when such claim arises from the installation or maintenance of any
courtesy bench as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 44-90.  Passed 4-9-90.)

required under this section and all endorsements thereto or other evidence, to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Director, that the licensee has secured or

construed to limit the licensee's liability hereunder.
   (E)   The licensee shall provide for the prompt and efficient handling of
all claims for injury, death, damage or loss arising out of the acts or
omissions of the licensee. The licensee shall agree that all such claims,

revoked shall not be reissued again. Licenses granted under this chapter may
also be suspended or revoked at anytime by the Chief of Police or his designee
if the vehicle is not in good condition and appearance, clean and safe.
Licenses when so suspended or revoked shall not be reissued until the vehicle
and all its appurtenances shall be put into fit condition for use by the
public.
(Ord. 218-83. Passed 12-19-83.)
852.11   RESTORATION OF SUSPENDED LICENSE.

852.14   DISPLAY OF LICENSE CERTIFICATE.
   It shall be the duty of every person to whom a taxicab license is issued to
post such license certificate in a prominent place upon the premises of the
headquarters from which the business is conducted and to keep such license
certificate so posted as long as such business is conducted thereunder. The
licensee shall not permit such license to be obscured or concealed in any way,
so that such license will not be readily visible at all times to persons
lawfully present on such premises.
(1956 Code Sec. 583.14)
852.15   TAG OR DECAL.
   The Mayor shall furnish to each licensee an appropriate license tag or
decal, in addition to the license certificate, which tag or decal shall be
displayed on the taxicab in such place as may be prescribed by the Police
Department. In case of the loss of a license tag or decal, the owner may file
with the Mayor a sworn statement of the facts concerning such loss and if the
Mayor is satisfied that the facts justify the issuance of a replacement tag or
decal, he shall issue such. The charge for such replacement tag or decal shall
be one dollar ($1.00).
(1956 Code Sec. 583.15)
852.16   IDENTIFICATION.

owner or as an agent, servant or employee of an owner, tenant  or lessee, or as
an independent contractor for an owner, or otherwise, any outside antenna
system for any type of radio antenna, television antenna or television
receiving apparatus or equipment, or any additions to or substitutions for such
a system, or a satellite antenna, unless and until a permit for such additions
or substitutions has been first obtained from the City Engineer. For the
purpose of this chapter, "antenna system" shall mean the structural apparatus
used to support any type of antenna attached thereon. 
(Ord. 10-92.  Passed 2-24-92.)
854.02   PERMIT APPLICATION.
   Any person desiring to erect, install or maintain any outside antenna system
for any type of radio antenna, television antenna, satellite antenna, or any
additions to or substitutions for any such system, shall make a written
application for the same to the City Engineer upon such forms as may be
prescribed, and accompany such application with a fee for the same as provided
in Section
854.04. Upon finding that the proposed installation or work complies in every
respect with the requirements of this chapter, the City Engineer shall issue a
permit to the applicant.
   Whenever property upon which such a satellite antenna, radio antenna,
television antenna or any other antenna is to be erected, or upon which
additions to or substitutions for existing antenna systems are to be made, is
not occupied by the owner thereof, any tenant must furnish a proper written
approval given by the owner thereof prior to the issuance of a permit.
(Ord. 10-92.  Passed 2-24-92.)
854.03   CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL.
   When any installation covered by a permit provided for in this chapter has
been completed, the person in whose name the permit therefor has been granted
shall immediately notify the City Engineer that the work is ready for final
inspection and shall pay the inspection fee required. Thereupon the same shall
be promptly inspected by representatives of the Division of Engineering and, if
the work complies in all respects with the provisions of this chapter and with
the permit, a certificate of approval shall be given by the City Engineer to
the permittee. In the event that such work does not comply in all respects with
the provisions of this chapter and with the permit, a certificate of approval
shall be withheld until and unless a subsequent inspection discloses
compliance. A request for reinspection shall be accompanied by the payment of a
reinspection fee as set forth in Section
854.04. Except for test purposes, no antenna system shall be placed in use
until such certificate of approval is obtained.
(Ord. 10-92.  Passed 2-24-92.)
854.04   PERMIT AND INSPECTION FEES; REINSPECTION.
   At the time of issuing a permit for any antenna system, the applicant

certificate of approval is given. If a reinspection is required, an additional
one-time fee in the amount provided in Section
868.01 shall be submitted to the City Engineer.  A permit is not necessary for
changing the type of antenna unless the design of the antenna will cause
additional stress on the antenna system.  Re-inspections may be required by the
City Engineer whenever it is found that the application contains an incorrect
address, when work is found to be faulty upon first examination, or when
repairs or corrections are not made when reinspection is requested.

   A Board of Appeals, consisting of three members appointed by the Mayor who
are electors of the City and who, by experience and training, are persons
qualified to pass upon the safety of installations and apparatus regulated by
this chapter, is hereby created. Such members shall not be employees of the
City, shall serve without compensation and shall hold office for three years,
unless removed by the Mayor. No member of the Board shall sit on a case in
which he is directly or indirectly interested, and in case of disqualification
for such cause or in case of the necessary absence of a member, the Mayor shall
make a temporary appointment of a substitute. All vacancies occurring on the
Board shall be filled by the Mayor. Upon consideration of a case upon appeal,
the Board may reverse, modify or affirm the decision or order appealed from. 
(Ord. 10-92.  Passed 2-24-92.)

Engineer. Such matter shall, within ten days thereof, be transmitted to the
Board, and a meeting to consider such matter shall be held within twenty days,
unless continued for good cause.
(Ord. 10-92.  Passed 2-24-92.)
854.08   BOND.
   Every person engaged in the business of erecting antenna systems for
television antennae, satellite antennae and radio antennae shall annually file
with the City Auditor a good and sufficient bond approved by such official,
payable to the City, in the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). Such bond
shall indemnify, save and keep harmless the City from any and all costs,
damages and expenses of any kind which may be suffered by the City or which may
occur against the same by reason of the granting of permission to erect any
television antenna or to perform any work thereon or by reason of any acts or
things done under or by authority granted by the City Engineer. Such bond shall
also inure to the use and benefit of any person or property by reason of the
construction, care and management of such antenna and may be drawn upon, in the
name of the City, for the use and benefit of any such person but without cost
or expense to the City.
   The maintenance of such bond in full force and effect as herein provided
shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any permit and certificate of
approval required under this chapter, except that such bond shall not be
required by a property owner desiring to perform such work upon his own
property.

real estate involved therein, written consent of the owner must be attached to
the application.

days thereafter in the event of such revocation or within forty-five days from
such expiration.

driveway, no portion of such trailer shall be closer than two feet to the edge
of the public sidewalk, or of the public street, and provided further, if such
trailer is parked in a side or rear yard, no portion of such trailer shall be
closer than three feet to the side lot line. No living quarters shall be
maintained in any such trailer, but occupancy by children or guests of the
owner thereof for a period not exceeding seven days shall not be construed as
the maintenance of living quarters, provided that toilet facilities shall not
be used in such trailer while so occupied or parked. No such trailer shall
exceed thirty feet in length or eight feet in width.

Revenue Code;
      (IV)   (A)   Except as provided in (IV)(B) of this definition, deduct

stockholders, with such other corporations or with such division, branch,

monthly deductions are three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month or more, the
employer shall make a return and pay such amount to the Director of Taxation on
or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the month in which
such deductions are made.  Such return shall be on a form prescribed by or

regulations prescribed therefore by the Director of Taxation.  The Director of

quarterly filing status shall be made in writing and, in such case, the
employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (b)   The employer collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment thereof is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for

under the provisions of this Chapter.
   (d)   Such declaration shall be accompanied by a payment of at least twenty-
two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated annual tax.  For taxpayers
who are individuals at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the
last day of the seventh (7th), tenth (10th) and thirteenth (13th) months after
the beginning of each taxable year. For taxpayers who are not individuals, at
least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of

income by twenty percent (20%) or more.  At such time a payment which, together
with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated
liability shall be made.  If, upon the filing of the return required by section
880.05, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay eighty percent (80%) of his
tax liability, as shown on such return, on or before January 31 or the date
fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the difference between eighty
percent (80%) of his tax liability and the amount of estimated tax which he
actually paid on or before the date due shall be subject to the interest and
penalty provided in section
880.10.  However, any taxpayer whose declared tax is equal to or greater than
the tax paid in the previous year shall not be assessed any interest or penalty
for any increased tax found to be due in the current year.

amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall

on income and the withholding tax established by this chapter are deemed to be
levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the provisions and

the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
   (b)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person residing

880.014   STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL

   (a)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 were
enacted by Am Sub H.B. 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
Municipal income tax.
   (b)   As mandated by H.B. 5, Municipal Income Tax Ordinance 260-15,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends

Chapter 880 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (b)   Ordinance 260-15 does not repeal the existing sections of

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in Ohio R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Ohio R.C. Title LVII.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural,

Federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income;
         B.   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         C.   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
Federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

Revenue Code;

extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code;
         E.   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income;
         F.   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
                  The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from
net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce
Municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net
operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for
more years than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            2.   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (c)(1)H.
of this section to offset qualifying wages.
            3.   a.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or

(c)(1)H.1. of this section.
               b.   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation

division (c)(1)H.1. of this section.
            4.   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (c)(1)H. of this section.
            5.   Nothing in division (c)(1)H.3.a. of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was

the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (c)(1)H.3.a. of this section
is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division
(c)(1)H.3.a. of this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
         I.   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income under this section as if the
taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar
amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and
treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code
or United States Treasury regulations.  Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified
self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.

construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for
purposes of Federal self-employment tax.

doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section 880.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section.  An employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section
shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the
last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
880.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold Municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or Municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.

municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
880.03.  To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold Municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (e)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and Social Security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator.  With the return, the
video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator
all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request.  Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year.  The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year.  The information return shall show the total amount of Municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year.  A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted.  Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable.  The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not filed
or filed late.  Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld
at the rate prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
   (i)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
880.07.  This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld. 
   (j)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
880.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
880.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
880.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the

following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a

within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.

separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a Municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
880.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions Section
880.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation. 
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of

Municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year

corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
880.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
880.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
880.062 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
880.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section 880.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

880.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
880.081   CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   When a resident of the Municipality is subject to a Municipal income
tax in another municipality, such taxpayer shall not pay a total Municipal
income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the highest rate
to which he is subject.
   (b)   Any individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who received
Municipal taxable income for work done or services performed or rendered
outside the Municipality and who paid a Municipal income tax on the Municipal
taxable income taxable under this chapter to another municipality shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter as determined under
division (c) below.
   (c)   A resident taxpayer who receives Municipal taxable income for services
performed in another municipality shall be required to determine the amount of
credit allowed under this section by:
      (1)   Separating the total Municipal taxable income between the Municipal
taxable income taxed by another municipality and all other Municipal taxable
income.
      (2)   Determine the lesser of the amount of tax actually paid to the
other municipality on the income determined under division (c)(1)A. of this
section, versus the Municipality's income tax rate multiplied by the Municipal
taxable income under division (c)(1)A. of this section.
      (3)   The taxpayer shall be allowed a credit equal to the lesser of the
amount determined under division (c)(2) of this section.
      (4)   The taxpayer shall pay the full Municipal tax rate on the income
determined under division (c)(1)B. of this section.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
880.081.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.084   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
880.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
880.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due.  If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
880.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
880.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.09   ANNUAL RETURN.
880.091   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident and
resident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer located in the Municipality under Section
880.051(c) when the nonresident or resident individual taxpayer's sole income

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or

individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The Department of Taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
Municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other Municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer

Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
880.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section 880.092, the provision in Section 880.092
prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of
this section.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  For
purposes of this section, “receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer.  Such funds are no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
880.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
880.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
         The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in Municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
Municipal taxable income on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

with this chapter.  The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code.  As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its Municipal income tax.

   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax

Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.

the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return

(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.095   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional Municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon.  If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. 
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
880.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
880.19(a)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
880.096.  Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.096   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other Municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment.  Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied.  The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
880.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return.  Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
880.10(a)(4).

   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.133   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.  The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
880.10.

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
880.99 for a violation of Section
880.15, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

880.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential.  In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.  Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service.  The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address.  For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority.  The Board member appointed by the
top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion
of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such Board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board.  The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative.  The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment.  The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions.  The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator.  No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may
remove such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations,
or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings
shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be
present during the hearing.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
880.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax
Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
880.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
880.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
880.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.20   ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 718.30, the Municipality, pursuant to this
chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt rules to administer
the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (b)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 260-15.  Passed 12-7-15.)
880.21   FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
880.21 to
880.36 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer, as defined in Section
880.22(c), is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§
718.80 to 718.95, Sections
880.21 to
880.36, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the City of Lima, on a form prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   A.   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the City of Lima of its
termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to Sections
880.21 to
880.36, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
this chapter.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
880.21 to
880.36. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Tax Commissioner by
law, the Tax Commissioner may:
      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such pyersonnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01 and Section
880.03.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.22   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
880.21 to
880.36 that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term
in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall have
control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined
in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to Federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
880.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in Sections
880.21 to
880.36.  As used in Sections
880.21 to
880.36 only:
   (a)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
880.23, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   "Adjusted Federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (d)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and Section
880.03, means a C corporation's Federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in Federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing Federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted Federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
880.27(e)(3)B.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
880.27(e)(3)B.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in Section
880.03(c)(47)B., and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in Section
880.03(c)(23)D.2., the taxpayer shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed
payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of
the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
         Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of Federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
880.03(c)(47), except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745.  "Taxpayer" may
include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
880.21 to
880.36 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for Federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
880.21 to
880.36 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for Federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for Federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
880.31.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.23   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Lima and that has made the election under Section
880.21.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of Lima shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the City of Lima for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Lima during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Lima to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
880.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
Lima to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City of Lima, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
880.31(a).
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
880.31(a).
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
Lima as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the City of Lima only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City of Lima
from a stock of goods located within the City of Lima.
         B.   The property is delivered within the City of Lima from a location
outside the City of Lima, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City of
Lima and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Lima to the extent that such services are performed in the City of
Lima.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City of Lima shall be sitused to the City of Lima.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City of Lima shall be sitused to
the City of Lima.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of Lima based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the City of Lima.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of Lima in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the City of Lima based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the City of Lima to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Sections
880.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)B.2. by the City of Lima or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the City of Lima. In no case shall a

well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and (c) of this
section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax
Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by

         B.   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through

tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax

   (e)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the

either through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.27   CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under Federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
880.21, a valid election made by the taxpayer under Section
880.063(b)(1) or (b)(2) is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
880.21 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated Federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
880.22, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section
880.22(b) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.23, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
880.23, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated Federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
880.23, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
880.21 to
880.36 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
880.23 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
880.21 to
880.36 or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.28   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
880.21 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
880.21 to
880.36, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C.
§5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the
date an assessment is issued under Section
880.31, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.29   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the combined tax liability
for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(b) of R.C. § 718.85.

be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
880.21 to
880.36 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income
tax return for that year.

Sections
880.21 to

required to be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent of the

880.21 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen percent of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
880.21 to
880.36 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
880.21 to
880.36, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
880.21 to
880.36, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return.

dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
880.31 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the

other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
880.21 to
880.36 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.31   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
880.21 to
880.36 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
880.32 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
880.21 to
880.36, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in R.C. §
5703.37.  With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions on how
to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
880.32, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.32   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
880.21 to
880.36, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by Section
880.31(a).  The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director
of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax
refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052.  If the amount is greater than ten
dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.33   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
880.21 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
880.21 to
880.36 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed
not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for Federal income tax purposes or after any Federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated Federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
880.31 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
880.32, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
880.32.  The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations,
or attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
(Ord. 046-18.  Passed 2-26-18.)
880.34   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
880.21 to
880.36 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to
investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal and state
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
880.21 to
880.36 shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Commissioner,
in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order
requires that they be kept longer. The Commissioner may require any person, by
notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Commissioner
determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the
extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
Federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City of Lima and taxpayer under Sections
880.064 or
880.065, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.

890.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (A)   "Hotel" and "motel" mean every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (B)   "Transient guest" means a person occupying a room for sleeping
accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (C)   "Operator" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel
or motel and who furnished the lodging.
   (D)   "Director of Taxation" means the Director of Taxation or the person
designated and appointed by the Mayor to execute the duties of the Director and
shall be the same person as designated Director of Taxation under
Chapter 880.
   (E)   "Board of Review" means the Board of Review created by and constituted
as provided in Section
880.13.
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
890.02   IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied an excise tax of three percent of the amount paid or
to be paid by the transient guest on transactions in which lodging by a hotel
or motel is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
   The tax applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished,
regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply to
lodging furnished to employees of the State or of its political subdivisions.
   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to prevent
the evasion of the tax, is it presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels or
motels in the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary
is established.
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
890.03   TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. If for any reason the
tax due is not paid to the operator, the Director of Taxation may require that
such tax be paid directly to the Director.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time the tax is collected and under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed
by the Director. All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed
by the Director.
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
890.04   TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   The tax to be collected under this chapter shall be stated and charged
separately from the charge for the lodging and shall be shown separately on any
record thereof, at the time when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and
charged for, and upon every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or
charge made for such occupancy issued or delivered by the operator.
   No operator shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
operator, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
890.05   REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after commencing business, each operator furnishing
lodging to a transient guest shall register his hotel or motel with the
Director of Taxation and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration
certificate, to be posted at all times in a conspicuous place on the premises. 
Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (A)   The name of the operator;
   (B)   The address of the hotel or motel;
   (C)   The date on which the certificate was issued; and
   (D)   The words "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies
that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the
Hotel-Motel Tax Ordinance by registering with the Director of Taxation of the
City of Lima, Ohio, for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the
Hotel-Motel Tax and remitting said tax to the Director of Taxation of the City
of Lima, Ohio. This certificate does not constitute a permit or license."
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)

due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, bills and other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall contain a copy of the certificate of exemption
required by Section

stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded. Such claim shall be filed with the Director within three years of the

INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Director of Taxation, or any authorized employee, is hereby
authorized to examine the books, papers, records and income tax returns of any
operator subject to the tax levied by this chapter for the purpose of verifying
the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was made, of ascertaining the
tax due under this chapter. Each person shall furnish, upon the written request
of the Director or his duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities
and opportunity for making the examinations and investigations authorized
herein.
   (B)   The Director is hereby authorized to order any person to appear in his
office and to examine such person, under oath, concerning any transaction or
receipt from any transaction which was or should have been returned for
taxation under this chapter. For such purposes, the Director may compel the
production of books, papers, records, income tax returns and the attendance of
any person before him, whether as a party or a witness, whenever he believes
that such person has knowledge of such transaction or receipt of such
transaction pertinent to such inquiry.
   (C)   Any information gained as a result of any return, investigation,
hearing or verification required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, except for official purposes or in accordance with judicial
order. No person shall divulge such information otherwise.
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
890.11   FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION BY DIRECTOR OF
TAXATION.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the Hotel-Motel Tax or to file a
return and to make a remittance of such tax or any portion thereof, as required
by this chapter, the Director of Taxation shall proceed in such a manner as he
deems best to obtain information on which to base his estimate of the tax due.
When the Director has such information as he is able to obtain upon which to
base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any
operator who has failed or refused to collect the same, to file a return and to
make a remittance of the proper amount thereof, he shall proceed to determine
and assess against such operator the tax and interest and/or penalty provided
for in this chapter.
   In any case wherein such determination is made, the Director shall give
notice of the amount to be assessed by serving it personally or by registered
or certified mail upon such operator. Such operator may, within ten days after
the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the
Director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax and penalty determined by the
Director shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If
such application is made, the Director shall give not less than five days'
written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show
cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amounts specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax and penalty. At any such hearing, the
operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax and penalty
should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Director shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
operator, in the manner prescribed in this section, of such determination and
the amount of such tax and penalty. The amount determined to be due shall be
payable within fifteen days.

remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a delinquency penalty equal to ten
percent of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to the tax
and the ten percent penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal to ten
percent of the total tax and penalty of the previous thirty-day period shall be
added for each successive thirty-day period that the operator remains
delinquent.
   (C)   Fraud. If the Director of Taxation determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to
twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalty stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof
   (D)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
   (E)   Abatement. Upon recommendation of the Director, the Board of Review
may abate the penalties or interest, or both. Upon appeal from the refusal of
the Director to recommend abatement of the penalties or interest, the Board may
nevertheless abate the penalties or interest, or both.
(Ord. 70-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
890.14   ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall
be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to
the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action
brought in the name of the City for recovery of such amount of tax, together
with any interest and penalties thereon.
   Except in the case of fraud, no assessment shall be made or issued against
an operator or transient guest for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this
chapter more than five years after the return date for the period in which the
lodging was furnished, or more than four years after the return for such period
is filed, whichever is later.

(Ord. 157-56. Passed 10-22-56.)
1020.04   PUBLIC UTILITIES.

provisions of this chapter. Such repairing and repaving shall be done under the
supervision of the Director of Public Works exclusively, upon due notice given
to him by the City Engineer.
1020.06   BACKFILL METHODS.
   The method of making the necessary backfill where an excavation has been
made shall be as follows:
   (A)   If a sewer is to be covered, stone sand shall be tamped solidly under
and around the sewer, with proper tools for that purpose, to a depth of twelve
inches. The remainder of the backfill shall be deposited in layers not
exceeding four inches in thickness, each of which layers shall be well pounded
and rammed with a rammer of suitable weight or with an approved pneumatic
tamper.
   (B)   In the case of an excavation other than a sewer, the earth backfill
shall be compacted in four-inch layers the same as stone backfill and shall at
all times be compacted to a density of not less than ninety percent of the
maximum density, according to the provisions of the State of Ohio Department of
Transportation Construction and Material Specifications, the latest edition.
Care that the backfill material contains the proper amount of moisture so as to
obtain the maximum compaction shall be exercised at all times.
   (C)   In lieu of subsections (A) and (B) hereof, ready-mixed "flowable fill"
may be used. If "flowable fill" is used, then overcutting the trench, as shown
in the Standard Drawings is not necessary. The fill shall be placed to within
two inches of the existing surface. The mix shall be: 100 pounds of Portland
concrete cement, 300 pounds of (Class C) fly ash, 2,600 pounds of fine
aggregate and approximately seventy gallons of water. The mix will yield
approximately ICY of flowable mortar with a compressive strength of
approximately 100 psi.
   Additional details of backfill methods can be found in the City of Lima's
Standard Drawings available in the office of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 5-86. Passed 1-6-86.)
1020.07   WARNING LIGHTS AND BARRICADES.
   (A)   Whoever makes or causes to be made any excavation in or adjoining any
street or public ground and whoever occupies or causes to be occupied any
portion of any street with any building material or obstruction shall provide
sufficient warning lights and barricades, as required herein, to adequately
protect pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (B)   Not less than two warning lights shall be secured and conspicuously
posted in or near such excavation, building material or obstruction, one or
more at each end of the space so excavated or occupied. If the space occupied
by such obstruction exceeds ten feet in length, then additional lights shall be
posted as aforesaid for every additional ten feet in length so excavated or
occupied. Such lights shall be lighted during the hours of darkness and at any
time when ordinary visibility is obscured. The City Engineer or any Assistant
City Engineer may, at his discretion, require additional lights in the case of
any excavated area.
   (C)   In the case of excavations, whether in or adjoining a street or public
ground, and in the case of other open or exposed places within the City,
suitable warning barriers shall be set up to protect against accidents.
(1956 Code Sec. 301.07)

branches. Notice shall also be sent to all public utility corporations and City
departments to install all necessary mains, conduits, service branches and
structures. Property owners, public utility corporations and City departments
shall he allowed the necessary and legal time required for the aforesaid
installations before the new pavement is laid. Thereafter, for three years from
the final completion and acceptance of the new pavement, no permit for making
an opening in such pavement shall be issued by the City except by express
authority in each case from the City Engineer, which authority shall be
exercised only for reasons of public necessity or of undue private hardship
where the necessity for the opening arises from causes over which the applicant
had no control. Lack of foresight in not installing service connections prior
to the laying of a new pavement shall not be considered an adequate reason for
abrogation of the three-year restriction.
(1956 Code Sec. 301.08)
1020.09   CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ALLEY CROSSINGS.
   (A)   All public or private alley crossings abutting any street being

1030.01   CONSTRUCTION OF CROSSINGS.
   All crossings of public streets and the tracks of railways within the
corporate limits shall be constructed and maintained in the following manner,
unless special permission is received from the Director of Public Works. There
shall be placed adjacent to each rail, oak timbers, commonly referred to as
guard logs, of a depth equal to the combined height of the rail and tie plate.
Two such guard logs shall be required outside each rail, constructed so that
only the necessary opening to maintain the rail remains. One guard log shall be
required inside each rail and constructed so that only necessary flangeway
opening is between the guard log and the gauge line of the rail. The guard logs
shall be eight inches wide minimum and shall be securely spiked to the cross-
ties by screw spikes. The guard log shall be pre-bored and counter-sunk so that
the top of the spike is flush with the top of the guard log or below it. The
crossing shall extend the full width of the street and beyond for a minimum
distance of eight feet to allow for a minimum four-foot sidewalk, as defined in
Section
1030.03. The area between the inner guard logs shall be constructed to within
two inches of the top of the rail with Bituminous Aggregate Base, Item 301 of
the State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and Material
Specifications, the latest edition. The remaining two inches shall consist of
Asphaltic Concrete, Item 404 of such Specifications.  The openings between the
rail and the adjacent guard log shall be filled with Item 404 or an oak timber
filler. Item 405, Bituminous Cold Mix, may be used as a temporary patch when
the local asphalt plants are closed. The area between the tracks of multitrack
crossings shall be constructed in the same manner, and with the same material
as between the rails of single track crossings. Solid timber or rubber
crossings shall be required as prescribed and directed by the Director of
Public Works when vehicular or railroad traffic warrants the same.
(Ord. 181-72. Passed 8-21-72.)
1030.02   MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING APPROACHES.
   The approaches to the tracks shall be defined as the full width of the right
of way owned by the railroad company, in accordance with the provisions of Ohio
R.C. 4955.20. Approaches shall be constructed of pavement equal to the pavement
of the street which is crossing at that point.
(Ord. 181-72. Passed 8-21-72.)
1030.03   MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING SIDEWALKS AT CROSSINGS.
   Sidewalks at all points where crossed by railroad tracks shall be
constructed and maintained in the following manner: The sidewalk shall extend
from the outside of the outer guard logs specified in Section
1030.01, shall not be less than four feet in width and shall be made of Class
"C" concrete not less than four inches in thickness according to specifications
available in the office of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 181-72. Passed 8-21-72.)
1030.04   NOTICE TO RAILROAD COMPANIES TO REPAIR CROSSINGS, APPROACHES OR
SIDEWALKS.
   It shall be the duty of the City Engineer, whenever ordered by Council to do
so, to notify any railroad company owning or controlling a railroad line
passing through the limits of the City to construct or repair, as the case may
be, crossings, approaches or sidewalks in accordance with the provisions of
Sections
1030.01 through
1030.03. Such notice shall be in writing, shall describe the place where such
crossing, approach or sidewalk is to be constructed or repaired, shall set
forth the kind and extent thereof and the manner in which the same is to be
constructed or repaired, as provided in the abovementioned sections, and shall
require that such crossing, approach or sidewalk be constructed or repaired
within thirty days from the date of service of the notice. Such notice shall be
serviced upon the nearest station agent or section foreman, and a true copy
thereof, with the date of service and manner of service endorsed thereon, shall
forthwith be filed by the City Engineer with the Clerk of Council.
1030.05   PROCEDURE IF RAILROAD COMPANY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH NOTICE.
   If a railroad company fails to construct or repair such crossing, approach
or sidewalk within thirty days after service of the notice provided for in
Section
1030.04, Council may cause such crossing, approach or sidewalk to be
constructed or repaired and charge the cost of so doing to the railroad
company. Such cost, with interest, shall be recovered by a civil action, in the
name of the City, against the railroad company, as provided by the laws of the
State.

CHAPTER 1034
Street Naming, Re-Naming and Honorary Street Naming
1034.01   (Reserved for) Street Naming.
1034.02   (Reserved for) Street Re-Naming.
1034.03   Honorary Street Naming.
1034.01   (RESERVED FOR) STREET NAMING.
1034.02   (RESERVED FOR) STREET RE-NAMING.
1034.03   HONORARY STREET NAMING.
   Honorary street names are signs posted under official city street name
signs, which are intended to honor and memorialize certain individuals or
historic and community events for a period of time, not to exceed 5 years, 
without changing the official name of the street or the official addresses of
residences and businesses on the street.
   (A)   Policy and Procedures.  This policy applies to all public streets in
the City of Lima. It does not attempt to regulate honorary street names on
private streets and driveways.  The intent is to provide opportunities to honor
and memorialize citizens who have made outstanding contributions to the nation,
state, city or community.  Historic and community events may also be
memorialized.  For this purpose, certain public roadways may be designated.  A
public roadway is a dedicated street, alley, bridge or other access route used
as an official address by properties abutting that roadway.  In order for such
opportunities to gain general public acceptance and proceed in a consistent and
orderly manner, the following procedure is prescribed.
      (1)   Filing of Application.  Any Lima city resident or organization
based in the community of Lima-Allen County may file with the Traffic
Commission an Application in the form approved by the Traffic Commission, and
all supporting documentation required therein, which must include the
following:
         (a)   The signatures of greater than 50% of the property owners on the
street segment being requested for the honorary naming;
         (i)   the additional signatures of at least 5 residents from each
ward;
         (b)   Non-refundable application fee of $450.00.
      (2)   Decision Criteria.  Honorary designations shall meet the following
criteria:
         (a)   The designation shall be confined to the roadway within the
vicinity of the home, business or location associated with the person or event.
         (b)   The roadway may not be a State Highway or U.S. Highway, as
determined by the City Engineer.
         (c)   There shall be only one honorary designation per public roadway,
and only one honorary sign will be allowed at an intersection.  There shall be
a maximum of 3 signs total over a two block length of public roadway.
         (d)   Preference shall be given to intersections and no more than
three blocks may be designated, such as the block where the person lived and
two adjacent street segments associated with the recognition.
         (e)   A well-known person or an important community event is:
            (i)   A person who has made a sustained contribution, over a long
period of time, above and beyond the call of duty and demonstrated leadership
relating to governance, human relations and development, or neighborhood
development.
            (ii)   A person who has made specific and sustained contributions
to an organization of significant import to the city or community.
            (iii)   A person who has demonstrated vigilance in changing the
nature and characteristics of the specific neighborhood, community or city.
            (iv)   An event which has historic significance to the city, state,
or country.
         (f)   Only one honorary designation shall be permitted for each
person, or event.
         (g)   No honorary designation shall be given to persons still alive.
      (3)   Staff Report.  The City Engineer shall evaluate the merits of the
Application and make a written report and recommendation to the Traffic
Commission within 45 days of the date of the application.
      (4)   Traffic Commission Action.  The Traffic Commission shall approve or
reject the application within 30 days of receipt of the City Engineer's report,
and forward its decision to Council.  The Commission may require the applicant
or City Engineer to submit any additional information the Commission determines
to be appropriate for it to consider, and may extend the time for decision on
the application if it determines it is necessary to do so.
         (a)   If the Commission denies a application, it shall specify its
reasons for denial, in writing, and serve its decision on the applicant
together with a notice of any rights to appeal the applicant may have.
      (5)   Appeals. In case of denial, the applicant may appeal the case to
the Mayor who may, based on the merits of the case and with due regard to the
deliberations of the Traffic Commission, uphold or reverse the decision.    The
Mayor shall forward his decision to Council.
      (6)   Public Notification.  A public notice of a meeting by City Council
on the matter shall be published in a daily newspaper of general circulation in
the city, thirty (30) days prior to the time of the City Council meeting.
      (7)   City Council Action.  Only applications approved by the Traffic
Commission and the Mayor, by way of appeal, shall be considered by City
Council.  Adoption shall be by Resolution, approved by at least two-thirds (2/
3) of the members elected to Council.
   (B)   Honorary Sign Standards.  In order to distinguish an official street
name sign from an honorary street name sign, the following standards are
prescribed (see also Attachment A for an illustration):
      (1)   The honorary sign shall be of  the same shape as the adjacent
official street name sign but of a size that is one (1) inch smaller in height
and width than the adjacent official street name sign.
      (2)   The font markings will be the same as the adjacent street sign but
of a height  that is one (1) inch smaller than that of the adjacent street name
sign.
      (3)   The color shall be green on white with green outline or the reverse
of the official street name sign currently adopted.
      (4)   A logo or an iconic symbol may be allowed provided that it is
related to the honoree's profession, trade, or legacy, and does not overwhelm
the sign itself, as determined by the Traffic Commission.
   (C)   Cost of Signs.  In addition to the application fee above the applicant
shall pay, in advance, an amount to cover the cost of design, fabrication,
installation, and maintenance over the 5 year period the signs would be in
place, as determined by the City Engineer.  This fee shall be payable to the
City of Lima Treasurer for deposit into the General Fund.
   (D)   Renewals.  Renewals, if desired at the end of the 5 year period, will
be handled like new requests with all applicable rules and fees in effect at
that time, and will require new signage.  If a renewal is not arranged the
honorary designation will be discontinued at the end of 5 years. Upon renewal
or the expiration of the honorary designation the Department of Public Works
shall remove the signage and make the signs available to the applicant.

(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.03   GENERAL DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter and except where expressly provided in
Section
1036.04, Definitions Applicable to Type I Applications for Minor Modifications,
the following words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section regardless of whether or not the words and
phrases are capitalized.
   (a)   "Antenna" means any apparatus designed for the purpose of the
transmission and/or reception of radio frequency ("RF") radiation, to be
operated or operating from a fixed location to facilitate wireless
communications services including but not limited to the transmission of
writings, signs, signals, data, images, pictures, and sounds of all kinds.
   (b)   "Applicant" means any person that submits an application to the City
to site, install, construct, collocate, modify, and/or operate a wireless
communications facility in the right-of-way.
   (c)   "Base station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. §
1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended and interpreted by the FCC and any other
authority with competent jurisdiction, which defines that term as follows:
      (1)   A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-
licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a
communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47
C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower.
      (2)   The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with
wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety
services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services
such as microwave backhaul.
      (3)   The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers,
antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and
comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including
distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks).
      (4)   The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the
time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under
this section, supports or houses equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(I)
through (ii) of 47 C.F.R.1.40001(b) that has been reviewed and approved under
the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local
regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or
primary purpose of providing such support.
      (5)   The term does not include any structure that, at the time the
relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this
section, does not support or house equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-
(ii) of 47 C.F.R. 1.40001(b).
      (6)   As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition
refers to any structure that actually supports wireless equipment even though
it was not originally intended for that purpose. Examples include, but are not
limited to, wireless facilities mounted on utility poles and other structures
in the right-of-way, light standards, or traffic signals when such structure is
approved by the City as an appropriate support for wireless transmission
equipment. An existing structure without wireless equipment replaced with a new
one designed to bear the additional weight from wireless equipment constitutes
a base station.
   (d)   "Collocation" means the mounting or installation of a wireless
communications facility on an existing eligible support structure or potential
support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio
frequency signals for communications purposes, as more specifically defined by
the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended or superseded.
   (e)   "Design guidelines" means those detailed design guidelines and
examples promulgated by the Department for the design and installation of
structures supporting wireless communications facilities in the right-of-way,
which are effective insofar as they do not conflict with FCC rules and
regulations or the design standards established in Section
1036.09.
   (f)   "Design standards" means those standards established in Section
1036.09 for the design, construction, and installation of wireless
communications facilities in the right-of-way, which are supplemented by design
guidelines, and which are effective insofar as they do not conflict with State
or Federal law, including without limitation any applicable FCC rules and
regulations.
   (g)   "Department" means the Department of Public Works of the City of Lima.
   (h)   "Director" means the Director of the Department of Public Works of the
City of Lima.
   (i)   "Eligible support structure" means the same as defined by the FCC in
47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny
tower or base station as defined in this section, provided that it is existing
at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local
government under this section."
   (j)   "Potential support structure" means an existing building or structure,
other than a tower as defined in this section, that may be transformed into a
base station through the mounting or installation of an antenna or transmission
equipment after that city approves it as a support structure and the permittee
installs transmission equipment pursuant to such approval; potential support
structures include but are not limited to buildings, steeples, water towers,
utility poles, light poles, City-owned structures in the right-of-way, and
outdoor advertising signs.
   (k)   "Person" means, without limitation, a natural person, a corporation,
whether nonprofit or for profit, a partnership, a limited liability company, an
unincorporated society or association, and two or more persons having a joint
or common interest.
   (l)   "Right-of-way" means real property for or devoted to (1) public
transportation purposes; or (2) the placement of the City's municipal utility
easements and other traditional uses along a transportation route, whether by
dedication, prescription, or otherwise, as well as the spaces above and below.
In addition to the foregoing, the definition of right-of-way includes, without
limitation, public highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges,
aqueducts, and viaducts within the City.
   (m)   "Substantial change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R.
§1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, and as applicable to facilities in the
public right-of-way, which defines that term as a collocation or modification
that:
      (1)   Increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet
(whichever is greater);
      (2)   Increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the
wireless tower or base station;
      (3)   Involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the
ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets;
      (4)   Involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment
cabinets that are ten percent larger in height or volume than any existing
ground-mounted equipment cabinets;
      (5)   Involves excavation or deployment of equipment outside the area in
proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on
the ground;
      (6)   Would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support
structure as determined by the Department; or
      (7)   Violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the
collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to
height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the
thresholds for a substantial change.
         Note: For clarity, the definition in this chapter includes only the
definition of a substantial change as it applies to facilities in the public
right-of-way. The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are
disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds
means that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height
increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated
deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted
support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless
equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically
separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site
dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012, the date that Congress passed
Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act.
   (n)   "Tower" means any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of
supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated
facilities, that are constructed for wireless communications services
including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services,
as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as
microwave backhaul, and the associated site, as more specifically defined by
the FCC in 47 C.F.R. §1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended or superseded.
   (o)   "Transmission equipment" means any equipment that facilitates
transmission of any FCC licensed or authorized wireless communications service,
including but not limited to radio transceivers, and other relevant equipment
associated with and necessary to their operation, including coaxial or fiber-
optic cable, and regular and backup power supply, as more specifically defined
by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(8). This definition includes equipment in
any technological configuration associated with any FCC authorized wireless
transmission, licensed or unlicensed, commercial mobile, private mobile, fixed
wireless microwave backhaul, and fixed broadband.
   (p)   "Wireless communications facility" means any unstaffed installation
for the transmission and/or reception of radio frequency signals for wireless
communications services, typically consisting of a tower or base station,
transmission equipment, equipment cabinets, and all materials or techniques
used to conceal the installation.
   (q)   "Wireless communications service" means any FCC-licensed or authorized
wireless communication service including, without limitation, any personal
wireless services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(D).
   (r)   "Wireless ROW permit" means a wireless facility right-of-way occupancy
permit as further defined in Section
1036.07(c).
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.04   DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO TYPE I APPLICATIONS FOR MINOR
MODIFICATIONS.
   For Type I applications for minor modifications, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them below, regardless of whether
or not the words and phrases are capitalized. In the event that any defined
term conflicts with any applicable Federal law or regulation, the Federal law
or regulation shall control.
   (a)   "Eligible support structure request" means the same as defined by the
FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as
"[a]ny request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does
not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station,
involving: (i) [c]ollocation of new transmission equipment; (ii) [r]emoval of
transmission equipment; or (iii) [r]eplacement of transmission equipment."
   (b)   "Existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001
(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that "[a] constructed tower or base
station is existing for purposes of [the FCC's Section 6409(a) regulations] if
it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting
process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, provided
that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a
zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for
purposes of this definition."
   (c)   "Site" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)
(6), as may be amended, which provides that "[f]or towers other than towers in
the public right-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property
surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to
the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to
that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment
already deployed on the ground."
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.05   APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   Pre-Application Requirement.  Before submitting an application,
applicant must submit a pre-application request form to schedule a meeting with
the Department.  The purpose of this meeting is so the applicant can share its
desired plans and receive informal feedback from the Department.  No
application will be accepted unless applicant has first completed its pre-
application meeting.
   (b)   Application.  Anyone seeking to site a wireless communications
facility in the right-of-way shall first duly file a written application with
the Department, in accordance with the requirements in this section and the
application requirements set forth in the design guidelines as modified from
time to time by the Director by the authority granted in Section
1036.09(c).
   (c)   Single Facility per Application. A single application shall propose
modification of no more than one existing eligible support structure,
installation on a potential support structure, or construction of a new tower
or base station.
   (d)   Recovery of Additional Costs Incurred in Processing Application.  The
Department is authorized to charge the applicant for recovery of additional,
reasonable costs incurred in its analysis, evaluation, and response to an
application under this chapter if the actual costs of review exceed the
application fee.  Nothing in the reasonableness limitation on additional costs
shall be construed to bar or limit the City's authority to incur costs it deems
necessary or appropriate in connection with the application.  Additional costs
may include unforeseen City staff review costs and the costs of third-party
technical experts hired to assist with review application. No City construction
or ROW wireless permits shall issue until and unless the applicant pays the
application fee and such additional costs as are authorized to be recovered
under this subsection.
      (1)   Authorization to retain independent consultants.  The Director 
may, in his or her discretion, and at any time in the review process, select
and retain an independent consultant with expertise in telecommunications
satisfactory to the Department in connection with any permit application. In
the event that the Department decides to retain an independent consultant for
technical review, it shall send written notice to the applicant including a
nonbinding estimate of the cost for such review. The applicant shall have five
business days from the date of mailing of notice to elect to withdraw the
application without any liability for any costs or expenses in connection with
the independent technical review.
      (2)   Scope.  The Department may request independent consultant review on
any issue that involves specialized or expert knowledge in connection with the
permit application. Technical review issues may include, but are not limited
to:
         A.   Permit application completeness or accuracy;
         B.   Planned compliance with applicable RF exposure standards;
         C.   Whether and where a significant gap exists or may exist, and
whether such a gap relates to service coverage or service capacity;
         D.   The applicability, reliability, and/or sufficiency of analyses or
methodologies used by the applicant to reach conclusions about any issue within
this scope; and
         E.   Any other issue that requires expert or specialized knowledge
identified by the Department.
      (3)   No permit until payment.  The applicant must pay for the cost of
consultant technical review and for the technical consultant's testimony in any
hearing as requested by the Department. No permit shall issue to an applicant
where that applicant has not timely paid any fee required under the Municipal
Code or established by the Director, or if the applicant owes payment on
outstanding invoices for costs recoverable by the City under this chapter.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.06   CATEGORIES OF APPLICATIONS.
   In accordance with FCC regulations, the Department shall classify every
application to locate a wireless communications facility in the right-of-way as
one of the following three types:
   (a)   A Type I application is for a minor modification that:
      (1)   Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and
      (2)   Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the
existing wireless tower or base station.
   (b)   A Type II application is for a modification that:
      (1)   Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and
      (2)   Substantially changes the physical dimensions of the existing
wireless tower or base station or does not qualify for approval pursuant to 47
U.S.C. §1455(a) for any lawful reason.
   (c)   A Type III application is one that proposes:
      (1)   Siting new transmission equipment on a potential support structure
in the right- of-way that does not already support transmission equipment; or
      (2)   Siting a new wireless communication facility on a new tower or
other support structure in the right-of-way.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.07   APPLICATION REVIEW AND WIRELESS FACILITY RIGHT-OF-WAY OCCUPANCY
PERMIT.
   (a)   General Standard of Review for Wireless Communications Facilities. 
All wireless communications facilities in the right-of-way shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter and to the design guidelines as modified from time
to time by the Director. The Department shall review and consider each
application according to the application classifications, review processes, and
deployment standards described in the design guidelines.
   (b)   Notice to Residents.  Within ten days of filing a Type II or Type III
application, the applicant shall provide the Department with proof of notice to
the owners of all real property located within a 200-foot radius of the site of
the proposed wireless communications facility as well as notice to the
corresponding neighborhood association, if any.  The notice shall inform
interested persons of the opportunity to file written comments to be submitted
to the Department, which comments should address whether the application
conforms to the provisions of this chapter.  The applicant shall provide the
Department with proof that the notice required under this section has been
given, including a mailing list for all recipients and a copy of the mailed
notice.  Notwithstanding the above, the Department may, at its discretion,
provide additional public notice if it determines such notice is in the best
interests of the public. Notice shall not be required for Type I applications.
   (c)   Written Decision.  Within five working days after the Department
renders a decision on an application, it shall send written notice to the
applicant.  Any denial shall include the reasons for the denial and information
regarding the process for an administrative appeal under Section
1036.07.
   (d)   Approval.  Approval of an application shall include the following
permissions:
      (1)   Permit to construct. A permit to construct the approved wireless
communications facility, subject to any conditions established by the
Department to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter and the Lima
Municipal Code.
      (2)   Wireless facility right-of-way occupancy permit. A wireless right-
of-way occupancy permit ("wireless ROW permit") granting the applicant
permission to occupy the right-of-way at the proposed site and subject to (a)
the standard conditions required by Section
1036.08 and (b) any additional conditions required by the Director  to carry
out the purposes and intent of this chapter and the Lima Municipal Code.  The
wireless ROW permit shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the right-
of-way.
   (e)   Restrictions on Wireless ROW Permits.  A wireless ROW permit may be
transferred upon notification to the City and acceptance by the transferee to
allow the transferee to site wireless facilities in the same location on the
same supporting structure as the transferor. Such a transfer may be made only
to a provider who possesses a current wireless ROW permit from the City for
siting wireless facilities elsewhere in the right-of-way.
   (f)   Denial.  The City reserves the right to deny an application if any one
of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The applicant has not demonstrated that its application conforms to
the provisions of this chapter and the Lima Municipal Code, including the
design guidelines established pursuant to this chapter;
      (2)   The applicant is not authorized to conduct business in the State of
Ohio;
      (3)   For any Type I application, the applicant has failed to show that
the project qualifies for approval pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) and the
related FCC regulations at 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001 et seq.;
      (4)   For any Type II or Type III application, the applicant has failed
within the prior three years to comply with or is presently not in full
compliance with the requirements of this chapter with regard to another
wireless communications facility that is not the subject of the application in
question;
      (5)   The applicant is in default of its obligation to pay to the City
fees imposed by this chapter;
      (6)   The design or location does not comply with the relevant standards
promulgated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) and utilized by the Department of Transportation of
engineering for construction in the right-of-way;
      (7)   The design or location does not comply with current or proposed
Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) promulgated by
the United State Access Board.
   (g)   Appeal of Denial on the Merits.  Upon denial of an application for
failure to meet the requirements of this chapter, the applicant may appeal the
decision to the Director for reconsideration.  The appeal must be in writing
and delivered to the Director no later than 5:00 p.m. (EST) on the tenth
business day after written notification by the City of denial of the permit. 
An appeal must provide a detailed explanation, in writing, of the reasons the
applicant contends the proposed wireless facility satisfies the requirements of
this chapter  (including if the application qualifies for a limited exemption
for personal wireless service facilities under subsection (h) hereof). The
appeal should include supporting documentation.  The Director shall review the
written appeal together with other evidence in the record and grant the permit
if the Director determines that, based on substantial evidence in the
application record, the permit complies with the requirements of this chapter.
The Director shall issue a written decision within ten business days of the
filing of the appeal. Failure by applicant to appeal and request
reconsideration under this section shall constitute a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies for purposes of any subsequent appeal in a court of
law.
   (h)   Limited Exemption for Personal Wireless Service Facilities.  Federal
law prohibits a permit denial when it would effectively prohibit the provision
of personal wireless services. Due to wide variation among wireless facilities
and technical service objectives, and due to changed circumstances over time, a
limited exemption for proposals in which strict compliance with this chapter
would effectively prohibit personal wireless services serves the public
interest.  Circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are
extremely difficult to discern, and specified findings to guide the analysis
promotes clarity and the City's legitimate interest in well-planned wireless
facilities deployment. Therefore, in the event that any applicant asserts that
strict compliance with any provision in this chapter, as applied to a specific
proposed wireless communications facility, would effectively prohibit the
provision of personal wireless services, the Director  may grant a limited,
one-time exemption from strict compliance, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Required findings. The Director  shall not grant any exemption
unless the applicant provides each of the following:
         A.   Evidence that the proposed wireless facility qualifies as a
"personal wireless services facility" as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(C)
(ii);
         B.   A clearly defined and reasonable technical service objective and
a clearly defined potential site search area; and
         C.   A meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual
reasons why (1) any alternative location(s) or design(s) suggested by the City
or otherwise identified in the administrative record are not technically
feasible and (2) the proposed location and design deviation is the least
noncompliant location and design necessary to reasonably achieve the
applicant's technical service objective.
      (2)   Scope of exemption.  The Director  shall limit the exemption to the
extent to which the applicant demonstrates such exemption is necessary to
reasonably achieve its reasonable technical service objectives.  The Department
may adopt conditions of approval specific to a permit issued as a limited
exemption pursuant to this section, as reasonably necessary to promote the
purposes in this chapter and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.08   STANDARD CONDITIONS OF PERMIT APPROVAL.
   (a)   Standard Conditions of Approval. Permission to site wireless
communications facilities in the right-of-way shall be conditioned on
compliance with the standard conditions of approval provided in this section. 
The Department may add or modify conditions of approval as necessary or
appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Wireless ROW Permit Duration.  For Type II and Type III permits, the
wireless ROW permit will automatically expire ten years from the issuance date,
except when Federal or State law authorizes the City to issue a permit with a
shorter term.  Any request for a permit renewal shall be reviewed as request
for a new permit subject to all applicable procedures and standards in effect
at the time the request is received.
   (c)   Standard Conditions of Approval for Type I Permits.  Any Type I permit
approved or deemed granted by the operation of law shall be automatically
subject to the following conditions of approval:
      (1)   Permit duration.  The City's grant or grant by operation of law of
a Type I permit constitutes a Federally-mandated modification to the underlying
permit or approval of the subject tower and/or base station. The City's grant
or grant by operation of law of a Type I permit will not extend the permit term
for any underlying permit or other regulatory approval, and its term shall be
coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the
subject tower or base station.
      (2)   Accelerated permit terms due to invalidation.  In the event that
any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of 47 U.S.C. § 1455
(a) or any FCC rule that interprets 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) such that Federal law
would not mandate approval of any Type I permit, such permit shall
automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order,
unless the decision specifically does not authorize accelerated termination of
previously approved Type I permits.  A permittee shall not be required to
remove its improvements approved under the invalidated Type I permit if it
submits an application for a Type II or Type III permit for those improvements
before the one-year period ends. The Department may extend beyond one-year the
time in which a permittee may apply for a Type II or Type III permit for an
invalidated Type I permit.
      (3)   No waiver of standing.  The City's grant or grant by operation of
law of a Type I permit does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any
standing by the City to challenge 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), any FCC rules that
interpret 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), or any particular Type I permit.
   (d)   Standard Conditions of Approval for All Wireless ROW Permits. All
applications for Type I, II, and III permits shall be subject to the following
standard conditions of approval by operation of law:
      (1)   Compliance with all applicable laws. Permittee shall at all times
maintain compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws,
regulations, ordinances, or other rules.
      (2)   Inspections; emergencies.  The City or its designee may inspect a
wireless communications facility in the right-of-way upon reasonable notice to
the permittee. The permittee shall cooperate with all inspections. The City
reserves the right to support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the
facility in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons
or property.
      (3)   Contact information for responsible parties. Permittee shall at all
times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for the
facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address, and email
address for at least one natural person.  All such contact information for
responsible parties shall be provided to the Department.
      (4)   Indemnities.  The permittee and, if applicable, the non-government
owner of a wireless communications facility shall defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless the City and its agents, officers, officials, and employees from:
         A.   Any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and
expenses arising out of any claims, demands, lawsuits, writs of mandamus, or
other actions or proceedings brought against the City to challenge, attack,
seek to modify, set aside, void, or annul the City's approval of the applicable
wireless ROW permit; and
         B.   Any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and
expenses and any claims, demands, lawsuits, or other actions or proceedings of
any kind, whether for personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out
of or in connection with the activities or performance of the permittee or its
agents, employees, licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or independent
contractors.
         C.   In the event the City becomes aware of any such actions or
claims, the City shall promptly notify the permittee and shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense. It is expressly agreed that the City shall have the
right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal
counsel providing the City's defense, and the permittee (as applicable) shall
reimburse City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by
the City in the course of the defense.
      (5)   Interference with public safety radio services.  In the event that
the City has reason to believe that permittee's radio communications operations
are causing interference with the City's radio communications operations, then
the permittee shall, at its cost, immediately cooperate with the City to either
rule out permittee as the interference source or eliminate the interference.
Cooperation with the City may include, but shall not be limited to, temporarily
switching the transmission equipment on and off for testing.
      (6)   Adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Permittee shall undertake
all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse impacts to adjacent properties
and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance,
modification, or removal of the facility.
      (7)   General maintenance. The site and the facility, including but not
limited to all landscaping, fencing, and related transmission equipment, must
be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved
plans and conditions of approval.
      (8)   Good condition required.  Wireless communications facilities shall
at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair by
qualified maintenance and construction personnel, so that the same shall not
menace or endanger the life or property of any person.
      (9)   Graffiti abatement.  Permittee shall remove any graffiti on the
wireless facility at permittee's sole expense.
      (10)   RF exposure compliance.  All facilities must comply with all
standards and regulations of the FCC and any other State or Federal government
agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards.
      (11)   Relocation for public improvement projects. Permittee shall remove
and relocate the permitted wireless communications facility at permittee's sole
expense to accommodate construction of a public improvement project by the City
as the City may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion.
      (12)   Removal if discontinued use. In the event that the use of a
wireless communications facility is discontinued, the owner shall provide
written notice to the City of its intent to discontinue use and the date when
the use shall be discontinued. If a wireless communications facility is not
removed within ninety days of discontinued use, the City may remove it at the
owner's expense irrespective of the notice requirement under this section.
      (13)   Taxes and assessments.  To the extent taxes or other assessments
are imposed by taxing authorities on the use of City property as a result of an
applicant's use or occupation of the right-of-way, the applicant shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise
required by the taxing authority.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.09   DESIGN STANDARDS AND SITING PREFERENCES.

      (4)   The proposed wireless facility shall comply with all applicable
design, construction and location provisions in the design guidelines.
   (b)   Design Guidelines.  The Department shall promulgate additional
detailed design guidelines for the design and installation of wireless
communications facilities in the right-of-way, which the department shall
consider in reviewing an application. The design guidelines will accord with
this section but will provide greater detail, description, and examples of
acceptable wireless facilities including visual depictions.  In addition, the
design guidelines shall provide administrative and procedural guidance to
applicants such as, for example, a list of minimum application requirements. 
The provisions in this section shall not limit or prohibit the Department's
discretion to promulgate and make publicly available other information,
materials or requirements in addition to, and separate from, the design
guidelines.
   (c)   The Director  shall have authority to update or supplement the design
guidelines to address relevant changes in law, technology, or administrative
processes.  In the event of any conflict between the design guidelines and the
standards articulated in this chapter, the language of this chapter takes
precedence over the language of the design guidelines.
   (d)   Revisions to the design guidelines that would materially modify the
physical design requirements for wireless facilities to make them more
unobtrusive or materially modify the standard and minor review locations for
wireless facilities shall be subject to a duly-noticed hearing prior to
adoption by the Director.  The notice shall be transmitted, at minimum, to all
neighborhood associations and any person holding a wireless ROW permit under
this chapter or having an active permit application for the same, and shall
provide reasonable time (not less than fourteen days) for those persons to
review and comment on the proposed modifications.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.10   RECOVERY OF COSTS; USE OF REVENUE.
   All costs recovered under this chapter shall be used to reimburse the
Department for its costs incurred in responding to applications and monitoring
installation and maintenance of wireless communications facilities in the
right-of-way pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.11   SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Prevention of Failures and Accidents. Any person who owns a wireless
communications facility sited in the right-of-way shall at all times employ
ordinary and reasonable care and install and maintain in use nothing less than
the best available technology for preventing failures and accidents which are
likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public.
   (b)   Compliance with Fire Safety and FCC Regulations.  Wireless
communications facilities, wires, cables, fixtures, and other equipment shall
be installed and maintained in substantial compliance with the requirements of
the National Electric Code, all FCC, State, and local regulations, and in such

   (c)   Surety Bond or Equivalent Financial Tool for Cost of Removal.  All
owners must procure and provide to the City a bond, or must provide proof of an
equivalent financial mechanism, to ensure compliance with all provisions of
this section. The bond or equivalent financial method must specifically cover
the cost of removal of each wireless communications facility which the owner
installs in the right-of-way in case the City has to remove or pay for removal
of the wireless facility. Two acceptable alternatives to a bond include a funds
set-aside and a letter of credit.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.12   NONCONFORMING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (a)   Any wireless communications facility sited in the right-of-way that is
legally in existence on the date of the adoption of this chapter but that does
not comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be permitted to remain
in the right-of-way but shall be considered a nonconforming wireless
communications facility.
   (b)   As of the March 27, 2017, the owner of the nonconforming facility and
the facility itself are subject to the standard conditions found in Section
1036.08 and the maintenance requirements found in Section
1036.11.
   (c)   If a nonconforming wireless communications facility is hereafter
damaged or destroyed beyond repair, any replacement facility must be designed
in accordance with all provisions of this chapter and the design guidelines.
   (d)   The provisions in this section shall not be applied to prohibit or
deny any collocation or modification pursuant to a Type I application, as
required by FCC regulations.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.13   SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of any part of this chapter are severable. If any provision
or subsection, or the application of any provision or subsection to any person
or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions, subsection, and
applications of such chapter to other persons or circumstances shall not be
made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.
(Ord. 070-17.  Passed 3-27-17.)
1036.99   PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any person who shall erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair,
convert, attach, or maintain any wireless communications facility in violation
of any of the terms of this chapter, or who, being the owner or agent of the

   (B)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, upon examination and testing by the Director of Utilities,
to meet all the requirements of this chapter. Abandoned sewers or openings
shall be plugged to prevent dirt or fill material from entering the sewerage
system.
   (C)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building sewer.
   (D)   No connection or lateral extending to private property from a public
sewer or drain shall be constructed except in accordance with specifications
issued by the Director.
   (E)   All connections, tappings or openings shall be made under the
supervision of the Director. The holder of a building sewer permit shall notify
the Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to
the public sewer.

Section 1040.101   SEWER BACKUPS INTO PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (A)   Property owners are responsible for ensuring the sanitary and/or storm
sewer drainage system connected to their building is at such height and in such
condition as to not allow backups in the public sewer system to infiltrate back
into the property owner’s building.
   (B)   Notwithstanding subsection (A), the Director of Utilities in his sole
discretion may make case-by-case determinations that due to the design or
installation of the public sewer system it is impracticable, unreasonable, or
it would be a substantial hardship, for the property owner to properly correct
the existing sewer connection between the property owner’s building and the
public sewer system.
      (1)   In the event the Director makes such a determination, the Mayor is
authorized to enter into an Agreement with the affected property owner whereby
the City agrees at the City’s cost and expense to perform all or part of the
work necessary to improve the sewer connection to the public sewer system to
minimize the risk of backups in the public sewer system infiltrating back into
the property owner’s building, under terms and conditions the Director
determines to be reasonable.
      (2)   The Mayor is authorized to enter into contracts with other persons
or entities to cause such work to be performed on behalf of the City, provided
some form of competitive bidding is allowed for such contracts, except in cases
of emergency to protect the public health, safety or welfare, or to protect the
integrity of the public sewer system, as the Director determines to be
appropriate.
      (3)   The Auditor is authorized to make payment as called for in such
contracts without separate approval of Council.
      (4)   The cost to the City associated with this section shall be included
in the rate base for all customers within the same classification.

1040.11   CONNECTIONS OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS.
   (A)   Whenever sewers are about to be or have been constructed for the
purpose of carrying off sewage and drainage from lots and lands outside the
City limits, no permission shall be given or granted to connect such sewers
with the sewers or treatment works of the City, nor shall the use of the
treatment works be permitted for the sewage and drainage of such lots and lands
outside the City limits, unless written permission has been secured from the
Director of Utilities as to sanitary sewers, and the City Engineer as to storm
sewers, which permission shall be given only if the sewers or system of sewers
for which such connection or use is sought conform to the plans theretofore
adopted by the City. A certificate of approval of such sewers by the Ohio EPA
shall also be furnished where, by law, such plans are required to be approved.
   (B)   Whenever annexation of any territory to the City is sought or
petitioned for, such annexation shall not be considered until a report of the
Director and/or the Engineer is filed with Council in regard to the status,
adequacy and efficiency of existing sewers or the sewerage system in such
territory.
   (C)   In addition to the approval of the Engineer and the Director as
required by this section, applicants for permission to use or connect with the
City sewerage system shall execute such agreements as to terms, conditions and
compensation for use of such sewers and treatment works as are required by the
City and authorized by law.
(Ord. 175-91.  Passed 7-8-91.)

Director.
   (C)   Amendment to Incorporate National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
The City reserves the right to amend this chapter and the terms and conditions
hereof in order to assure compliance by the City with applicable Federal and
State laws and regulations. Within nine months of the promulgation of a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, this chapter shall be amended to
require compliance by users with such standards within the time frame
prescribed by such standards. All National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
adopted after the promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by the City as
part of this chapter, by reference. Where a user, subject to National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, has not previously submitted a baseline
monitoring report, the user shall file a baseline monitoring report with the
City within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. EPA. In addition, any user
operating on the basis of a previous filing of a baseline monitoring report
shall submit to the City within 180 days after the promulgation of an
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the additional
information required by subsection (e) hereof. The user shall be informed by
the Director of any proposed changes in this chapter at least thirty days prior
to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in this chapter
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (D)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.  National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards as promulgated by the U. S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) pursuant to The Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as
amended, shall be met by all categorical industrial users of the treatment
works. Categorical standards for pretreatment of such pollutants are published
under the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, and are
available from the Director. All owner(s) of any source to which categorical
pretreatment standards are applicable shall be in compliance with such
standards within the shortest reasonable time, but no later than the time
prescribed by the standard for the applicable industrial category. The City
reserves the right to convert mass per unit of production limits contained in
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards to equivalent mass per day or
concentration limits. If the City develops these equivalent limits, they are
deemed pretreatment standards, applicable to categorical industrial users in
lieu of the promulgated standards.
   (E)   Initial Compliance Report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the significant industrial user with applicable
pretreatment standards set forth in this chapter or within ninety days
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the treatment
works by the industrial user, any significant industrial user subject to this
chapter shall submit to the City a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, the average and maximum daily flow in gallons, and, if subject to
production-based standards, the industrial user shall provide production data. 
Sampling and analysis of the typical wastewater discharge from the facility
shall also occur, which shall follow the same requirements as outlined in
1040.12(A)(2).  The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to
bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user as required in subsection (h) hereof, and
certified to by a professional engineer.
   (F)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard
set forth in this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
standard, or, in the case of a new significant industrial user, after
commencement of the discharge to the City, shall submit to the City during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the City, a
report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated
substances in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards
hereof. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported
in subsection (F) hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual
measurement, provided, however, where cost or feasibility considerations
justify, the City may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by
verifiable techniques. The City, for good cause shown considering such factors
as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating
factors, may authorize the submission of such reports on months other than
those specified above.
      (2)   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the City, during the reporting period.
The frequency of monitoring by the industrial user shall be as prescribed in
the industrial discharge permit pursuant to Section
1040.121. The City shall require the frequency of monitoring necessary to
determine compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136,
and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA
publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutant, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of
the U. S. EPA.
      (3)   If any industrial discharger subject to the reporting requirements
in subsection (F) hereof, monitors any pollutant more frequently than required
by the Director using procedures specified in paragraph (F)(2) hereof, the
results of this monitoring must be included with any compliance reports
required by the Director.
   (G)   Sampling Procedures.
      (1)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the discharger shall notify the Director within twenty-four hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The discharger shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within
thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not
required to resample if:
         (a)   The City performs sampling of all regulated parameters at the
industrial user at least once per month; or
         (b)   The City performs sampling at the industrial user between the
time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
      (2)   If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted
by the City, the City shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis within 30
days of becoming of the violation unless the industry is notified of the       
    violation and the City requires it to perform the repeat sampling and
analysis.

   (L)   Burden of Proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (M)   User Responsibility in Case of Upset. The industrial user shall
control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (N)   Notification of Problem Discharges. All categorical and noncategorical
industrial users shall notify the Director immediately of all discharges that
could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings by the industrial
user. Any event of noncompliance with pretreatment standards shall be reported
immediately to the POTW, upon first awareness of the commencement of
noncompliance. Where such information is given orally, a written follow-up
report thereof shall be filed by the user with the Director within five days.
The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the noncompliance event, the cause thereof and the
impact on a user's compliance status;
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of

Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within twenty- four hours.
   (S)   Prohibition of Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited and the Director may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
subsection (Q) hereof.
      (2)   The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet
the three conditions listed in paragraph (R)(1) hereof.
   (T)   Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the City
with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the
public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the industrial
user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or
proprietary information of the user. When requested by an industrial user
furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for
uses related to this chapter, the NPDES permit, State disposal system permit
and/or the pretreatment programs, provided, however, that such portions of a
report shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the industrial user furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be recognized as
confidential information. Information accepted by the City as confidential
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by
the City until and unless a notification is given to the industrial user.

1040.13   USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (A)   The following described substances, materials, waters or waste shall
be limited in discharges to the Municipal system to concentrations or
quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process
or equipment; will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; will not
cause violations of the NPDES regulations; will not inhibit the City's sludge
use or disposal method; or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public
property, or constitute a nuisance. The Director may set limitations more
severe than the limitations established in this chapter if in his opinion such
more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming
his opinion as to the acceptability, the Director will give consideration to
such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the
wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant,
and other pertinent factors. Discharges to the sanitary sewer with the
following characteristics or pollutants are prohibited:
      (1)   Any waters or wastes containing pollutants which create a fire or
explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with
a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or sixty degrees
Centigrade using the test method specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      (2)   Any waters or wastes containing pollutants which result in the
presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that
may cause acute worker health and safety problems.
      (3)   Where continuous pH measurement is not employed, any water or
wastes having a pH lower than 6.0, or higher than 11.0 or as otherwise
required, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the treatment works.
      (4)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit
(sixty- five and one-half degrees Celsius) at the point of entrance to the main
sewer. This discharge shall not cause the composite waste received at the
wastewater treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (forty degrees
Celsius).
      (5)   Wastewater containing amounts of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable
cutting oils or product of mineral oil origin that can pass through or cause
interference.
      (6)   Wastewater from non-domestic users containing floatable oils, fat
or grease.
      (7)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders
may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage
originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers.
      (8)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, cadmium, chromium, copper,
lead, nickel, zinc, mercury or other objectionable or toxic substances to such
degree that any such material received in the composite wastewater at the
wastewater treatment plant exceeds the limits established by the Director for
such materials.
      (9)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Director.
      (10)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life concentration
as may exceed limits established by the Director in compliance with applicable
State or Federal regulations.
      (11)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a slug
as defined herein.
      (12)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such a degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (13)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes. The Director shall require
all discharges to conform to all NPDES permit requirements and any other State
or Federal regulations.
      (14)   Any substance which may cause the treatment works effluent or any
other product of the treatment works such as residues, sludges or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation
process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the treatment works cause
the treatment works to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal
criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, as amended, 33
U.S.C. 1251 et seq.
      (15)   Any substance which causes pass through or interference as defined
in Section
1040.01.
      (16)   Any water or wastewater which is categorized as "hazardous waste"
as regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
      (17)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions.
      (18)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metals, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair, fleshings or entrails.
   (B)   No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way
for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
chapter.
   (C)   Where an industrial user continuously measures the pH of its discharge
to the sanitary sewer, the user shall maintain the pH of such wastewater within
the range set forth in Section
1040.13 (a)(3). Excursions from the range are permitted subject to the
following limitations:
      (1)   The total time during which the pH values are outside the required
range of pH values shall not exceed six hours in any calendar month;
      (2)   No individual excursion from the range of pH values shall exceed
fifteen minutes in any sixty minute period; and
      (3)   No instantaneous excursion of pH values shall be below 2.0.
   For purposes of this Subsection
1040.13(b), an "excursion" is an unintentional and temporary incident in which
the pH value of a discharge to the sewer exceeds the range set forth in 
Section
1040.13(a)(3).
   (D)   The following is the calculated pollutant levels that can be safely
managed at the headworks of the Lima Waste Water Treatment Plant:
 
Maximum Parameter lb/day
Chromium          24.0
Copper            12.0
Lead              5.04
Nickel            8.55
Zinc              19.2
Mercury           Narrative Limit - See discussion below
 
    A part of each pollutant above has been allocated to the industries that
discharge them.  A schedule of that allocation may be obtained from the
Director’s office.  Should a new industry that intends to use any of the above
metal in its process locate its facility within the confines of the City’s
sewer system, or a sewer system which discharges to the City’s sewer system (a
satellite system),  that industry will be required to negotiate with the City
for its discharge limits of the above pollutants.  Also, any entity found
through sampling to be discharging the above pollutants above background
concentrations may be placed on a monitoring schedule at the discretion of the
Director.
For mercury, every industrial user will be required to develop a plan outlining
the best management practices (BMP) it will employ to eliminate the
introduction of mercury into the collection system from its process flow.  A
copy of this BMP plan shall be filed with the Director.
   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the judgment of
the Director may cause the pass through or interference of the POTW, or
otherwise be incompatible with the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment
or receiving waters, inhibit the City's sludge use or disposal method, violate
any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter, endanger the health or safety
of POTW employees or other persons, create a hazard to the environment, cause
the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit or constitute a public
nuisance, the Director may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Suspend the treatment service to a user as provided for in Section
1040.143, or take other enforcement action.
   If the Director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Director, and of OEPA.
   (F)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable
wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Director, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and
shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Director. Any removal and hauling of the collected material not
performed by the owner(s)' personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.
   (G)   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at his expense.
   (H)   When required by the Director, the owner(s) of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable
structure together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such structure, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The
structure shall be installed by the owner(s) at his expense and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   The Director may require a user of sewer services to provide
information needed to determine compliance with this chapter. These
requirements may include the information described in Section
1040.12.
   (J)   No provision of this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or  arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, provided the special arrangement does not violate then
existing State or Federal regulations. 
(Ord. 42-01, Passed 3-26-01; Ord. 32-04,  Passed 2-23-04; Ord. 153-14, Passed
6-23- 14.)
1040.14   INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The Director of Utilities and/or other duly authorized employees of
the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling and testing pertinent to discharge to the POTW in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The Director and/or designated employees shall be authorized to
examine and to copy any records retained by an industrial user pertaining to
its sewer discharge or pretreatment requirements.
   (C)   The Director and/or other duly authorized employees are hereby
authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes which have a
direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater collection
system.
   (D)   While performing the necessary work on private properties, referred to
in this section, the Director and/or duly authorized employees of the City
shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the
company, and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to City
employees, and the City shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to
its property by City employees and against liability claims and demands for
personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing out
of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by
negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
(Ord. 175-91.  Passed 7-8-91.)
1040.141   ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES PROTECTION.
   (A)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
chapter. Where required by the Director to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials, facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing such facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Director for
review and shall be approved by the Director before construction of such
facility. Industrial users required to provide such facilities shall submit
plans within ninety days after the Director has required such plans. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Director shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as
necessary to meet the future requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Industrial users shall notify the City immediately upon the occurrence
of an accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this chapter. The notification shall include location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume and
corrective actions. Any industrial user who discharges prohibited materials or
other substances regulated by this chapter exceeding limits imposed by this
chapter shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the treatment works,
in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the City on account thereof
under State or Federal law, or in addition to any penalties assessed to the
industrial user under Section
1040.99.
   (C)   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on industrial
users' premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 175-91.  Passed 7-8-91.)
1040.142   RECORDS RETENTION.
   All users subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve for no less than
three years any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence
and any and all summaries thereof relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical
analyses made by or in behalf of a user in connection with its discharge. All
records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative
adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the
Director pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the user until all
enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with
respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 175-91.  Passed 7-8-91.)
1040.143   ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Notification of Violation.  Whenever the Director finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter or a wastewater
permit or order issued hereunder, the Director may serve upon said user written
notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to
the Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.
   (B)   Show Cause Hearing.  The Director may order any industrial user which
causes or contributes to violation of this chapter or wastewater permit or
order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal
executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified
industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be
pursued.
   (C)   Administrative Order.  When the Director finds that an industrial user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued
thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the
discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may
also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
   (D)   Emergency Suspensions.  The Director may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.
   Any user notified of an emergency suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment
to any individuals. The Director shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
set forth in subsection (E) hereof are initiated.
   A detailed written statement shall be submitted by the user within fifteen
days of the date of the occurrence, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.
   (E)   Termination of Permit. Any user who violates the following conditions
of this chapter, or an industrial discharge permit or order, or any applicable
State and Federal law, is subject to permit termination:
      (1)   Violation of permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling.
   Noncompliant industrial users shall be notified of the proposed termination
of their discharge permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
subsection (B) hereof why the proposed action should not be taken.
   (F)   Annual Publication. At least annually, the Director shall publish a
list of all industrial users which at any time during the previous twelve
months were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in
significant noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the following
criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits (applies only to
SIUs) , defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all of the
measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) an
instantaneous limit, the daily maximum limit, or the average limit for the same
pollutant parameter;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations (applies only to SIUs),
defined here as those in which thirty-three percent or more of all of the
measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal
or exceed the product of an instantaneous limit, the daily maximum limit, or
the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats,
oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum
or longer term average) that the Director determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Any violation of an established BMP that adversely affects the
operation of the POTW or implementation of the pretreatment program;
      (6)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (7)   Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, initial compliance reports,
periodic self- monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
      (8)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (9)   Any other violation or group of violations which the Director
determines will or has adversely affected the operation or implementation of
the City's pretreatment program.
   (G)   Judicial Remedies, Penalties and Administrative Fines. See Section
1040.99.

1040.15   CHARGES LEVIED.
   (A)   On and after January 1, 1976, there is hereby levied and assessed upon
each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having any sewer connection with
the sanitary sewer system of the City or otherwise discharging sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into
the City wastewater treatment system, a charge or rental.
   (B)   The users of the system shall be divided into classes. Classes shall
be groups of users for which the wastewater characteristics are approximately
equal and services provided are essentially the same. Initially, there shall be
established two classes of users, as follows:
      (1)   Industrial users; and
      (2)   Nonindustrial users.
   The Director of Utilities may recommend additional classes as determined to
be necessary.
   (C)   Charges for wastewater treatment service shall be paid by each user
connected to the system and shall be computed in accordance with the probable
demand a user places on the system and the quantity of water discharged to the
system, as measured by the City water meter installed thereon or by a sewage
meter installed on the discharge pipe therefrom, or as estimated by the City,
in accordance with the charge schedule hereinafter set forth.
   (D)   When a considerable amount of water delivered to any premises is not
returned to the City's sewage disposal system, the Director may establish a
special basis upon which the sewage disposal charges to such premises will be
computed, or upon a determination by either the Director or the customer that
the use of direct metering of sanitary sewage flow is necessary or is a more
equitable method of determining sewage disposal charges, the Director shall
order the installation of wastewater meters.

1040.241   REPLACEMENT OR  REHABILITATION OF SEWER LATERALS IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT
OF WAY AND IN PUBLIC SEWER EASEMENT AREAS.
   (A)   For purposes of this section, a “sewer lateral” is defined as a sewer
that connects the sanitary plumbing in a structure to the City’s public main
sewer line.  Sewer laterals which convey both storm and sanitary flows
(combined sewers) are also included in this definition.
   (B)   Sewer laterals shall be installed and maintained in proper working
order, as determined by the Director of Utilities, at the expense of the owner
and in accordance with any applicable provisions of this Chapter or applicable
provisions of other state, federal, or local laws, rules, or regulations. The
City of Lima has no legal obligation to maintain or repair any sewer lateral or
other part of the sewer system beyond the City’s main sewer line, but may under
take such action provided for in this section at the sole discretion of the
Director of Utilities.  Nothing in this section is intended to allow the
property owner to avoid the legal obligation for the installation, maintenance,
and repair of sewer laterals from the structure to the City’s main sewer line.
   (C)   If the Director of Utilities determines a sewer lateral located within
the public right-of-way or a public sewer easement area is not properly
functioning, or is otherwise in need of rehabilitation or repair, the Director
is hereby authorized to cause such rehabilitation or repair to be performed at
the City’s cost.

within the public right-of-way or a public sewer easement  area  is not
properly functioning, or is otherwise in need of rehabilitation or repair, the
Director shall issue a notice to the owner identifying the correction that
needs to be made and the time limits for the correction to be made.
      (1)   If the owner fails to make the necessary correction the Director of
Utilities is hereby authorized to take all necessary action to cause such work
to be performed upon such a sewer lateral, as the Director determines is
appropriate to properly provide for the sewer lateral connection to the City
sewer.
      (2)   The Director of Utilities, with the approval of the Mayor,  is
authorized to enter into special agreements or arrangements between the City
and a private property owner to accomplish the rehabilitation or repair of such
a sewer lateral.
      (3)   If the owner fails to pay the cost of any work performed or caused
to be performed by the City, the Director of Utilities shall certify the cost
of same to the City Auditor, who is hereby authorized to certify such costs to
the County Auditor as a special sewer assessment to the property served by the
sewer lateral.

wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, value and
delivery flow-rate characteristics shall be included to ensure a proportional
distribution of the costs.
   (B)   The charges shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically as
required.
   (C)   The charges shall derive revenue sufficient to meet all costs of
operation, maintenance and replacement of the system.
(Ord. 175-91.  Passed 7-8-91.)
1040.26   LIABILITY OF OWNER FOR CHARGES; TENANT ACCOUNTS; PAYMENTS.

the real estate.  As a condition of receiving sewer service from the City, any
owner of real estate agrees to be governed by the provisions of this Code and
Ordinances of the City of Lima, and all rates, rules and regulations
established by the Mayor and Department of Utilities, and the owner shall be
liable for all sewer, service, or other charges for such accounts.
   (B)   Notwithstanding subsection (A), the Mayor is authorized to develop and
implement rules and regulations relating to the establishment of sewer accounts
in the name of a tenant occupying any real estate, provided however that the
owner of such real estate shall remain ultimately liable for payment of the
account as set forth subsection (A) if the tenant fails to pay the same.
   (C)   All charges for connection, permits, etc. shall be payable upon
application.

   (G)   A penalty of $10.00 or 10% of the bill, whichever is greater, shall be
added to each charge if it is not paid promptly at the time established by the
Mayor.  The Director of Utilities shall have the authority to waive the late
fee for first-time occurrences of late payment, per account, and to also waive
second-time occurrences of late payment if the account payor establishes an
automatic payment option suitable to the Director.
   (H)   Each charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a
lien upon the corresponding real estate served by a connection to the
wastewater system of the City, and if the same is not paid within thirty days
after the due date, it may be certified as delinquent by the Director of
Utilities to the County Auditor, who shall place the same on the tax duplicates
of the County, with interest and penalties allowed by law, and it shall be
collected as other taxes and assessments on the property are collected.

sanitary sewer by permission of the Director of Utilities.
   (B)   Whenever the Director finds that any provision of this section is
being violated, he shall issue a written order to the person responsible for
the removal, elimination or correction of such condition, for removal of such
connectors or drains from such sanitary sewer within ninety days after service
of such order.
   (C)   The service of such order shall be made upon the person to whom it is
directed, either by delivering a copy of the same to such person, or by

to the entrance of such premises.
   (D)   Storm water, other than that exempted under this section, and all
other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged into such sewers as are

   (A)   Judicial Remedies. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes,
or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions
of this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the Director, through
the City Law Director may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the Court of Common Pleas for Allen County.
      (1)   Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued
hereunder, the Director, through counsel may petition the Court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the
industrial user. The Director shall have such remedies to collect these fees as
it has to collect other sewer service charges.
      (2)   Civil penalties. Any industrial user who has violated or continues
to violate this chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder shall be liable
to the Director for a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars
($10,000), but at least ($1,000) per violation per day for as long as the
violation continues, plus actual damages incurred by the POTW. In addition to
the above described penalty and damages, the Director may recover reasonable
attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the
enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses. The
Director shall petition the Court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In
determining amount of liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the
violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the
industrial user's violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the
compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
      (3)   Criminal prosecution.
         (a)   Any industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more
than one year, or both.
         (b)   Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or
wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or
both.
   (B)   Administrative Fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter,
or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct
violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer
service charge and the Director shall havesuch other collection remedies as he
has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall
constitute a lien against the individual user's property. Industrial users
desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the Director to
reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the
Director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter
within fifteen days of receiving the request from the industrial user.
   (C)   Recovery of Costs Incurred by the Authority. Any user violating any of
the provisions of this chapter, or who discharges or causes a discharge
producing a deposit or obstruction or causes damage to or impairs the City's
wastewater disposal system shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss or
damage caused by such violation or discharge. The City may bill the user for
the costs incurred by the City for any cleaning, repair or replacement work
caused by the violation or discharge.

containers as provided in Section
1052.06. However, brush and branch clippings may be tied securely in bundles
not exceeding four feet in length and placed at the curb line or alley line,
whichever is the usual place of collection. Items which exceed the capacity of
the container, and large items, such as Christmas trees, discarded furniture,
appliances, bicycles, sleds, swing sets, tools and comparable materials, shall
be placed at the curb line or at the alley line, whichever is the usual place
of collection by the contractor.
      (1)   No person shall place any item or material at the curb or alley
line for collection service which is not defined for purposes of this Chapter
as “garbage” or “refuse” under Section
1052.01, or which is otherwise prohibited under the current garbage and refuse
contract entered into between the city and any garbage and refuse collection
contractor, or as otherwise prohibited by the Director of Utilities.  The
Director of Utilities shall make available to the public a listing of all the
types of items not permitted for collection service, which shall also be
included in the annual month of May garbage and refuse bill, and may also be
posted on the City’s website.
      (2)   The total volume of items or material set out for collection shall

or large items permitted in subsection (A) above, on any street, curbside, or
public right of way for collection and disposal thereof any earlier than 6:00
p.m. the day before the scheduled collection day and such resident or owner
must remove the garbage container(s) no later than 6:00 p.m. the day after the
scheduled collection day.  When not set out for collection in accordance with
this subsection, all garbage containers must be kept behind the front building
line of the residence or structure served for collection service, and must be
placed on a solid, generally non-porous surface, such as concrete, asphalt,
brick, block, stone (excluding loose stone) or wood-decking type platform.
      (1)   Upon a violation of any part of this subsection (B), the resident
and owner shall be notified by the Utilities Department of the violation of the
service contract or city code.  If the owner or resident signs and returns the
notice of violation by U.S. mail, postmarked within seven (7) days of the date
of mailing of the notice, no penalty shall be assessed for the violation.  If
the notice is not returned within the 7 day period, the owner or resident shall
be assessed a non-compliance administrative fee of twenty-five dollars
($25.00).  Any subsequent violation within a 24 month period from the first
violation shall result in the imposition of a non-compliance administrative 
fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). 
      (2)   However, notwithstanding the above, if a violation of this
subsection (B) results in the city or the city’s contractor picking up any
material for which there is a separate cost or charge to the city, the Director
of Utilities shall issue a notice of violation to the resident or owner and
shall impose the following:
         (a)   On a first offense, the owner shall be charged all actual costs
of removal of the items or material;
         (b)   On a second offense within 24 months of the first offense, a
non- compliance administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50), plus an
administrative fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), plus all actual costs of
removal of the items or material;
         (c)   On a third or more offense within 24 months of the first
offense, a non- compliance administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50), plus an
administrative fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00), plus all actual costs of
removal of the items or material;
   (C)   The Director of Utilities shall have the discretion to waive any or
all of an administrative fee or fine imposed under this section if he
determines there are sufficient mitigating circumstances that indicate the
violation was an isolated incident, not likely to be repeated, that the fee or
fine would impose an undue financial hardship, or for other good cause
consistent with the goals of this section. The Director shall further have the
authority to waive or adjust the requirements for garbage container storage
behind the front building line when the director determines it is necessary or
appropriate to do so under the particular circumstances then existing to avoid
undue hardship to the resident.
   (D)   Any person receiving a notice of violation under this section may
appeal the same through the Claims Advisory Board as set forth within City Code
Chapter 272.  Such appeal must be mailed to the City Director of Law, and
postmarked within 7 days of the date of mailing of the notice of violation. 
The Board shall have the authority to reverse or modify any order or decision
of the Director of Utilities, as it deems appropriate.

place any recycling container or material for collection on any street,
curbside or right-of- way earlier than 6:00 p.m. the day before the scheduled

recycling container from the collection site no later than 6:00 p.m. the day
after the scheduled collection day.
   (D)   Following receipt of a complaint or observance of a violation of 
division (C) of this section, the resident or owner shall be notified by the
City as to a violation of this section.  After issuance of such notice, the
resident or owner shall, within 24 hours, remove the recycling container from
the street, curb or public right-of-way.  Should the property owner or resident
fail to remove the container, the Utilities Department shall cause the removal
of such container(s).  The owner or resident shall be billed for the cost of
the removal service, together with a twenty-dollar ($20.00) administrative
fee.  These charges shall be added to the next garbage and refuse charge for

each such collection in violation hereof from one or more designated recycling
collection locations during said 24-hour period shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense punishable as provided in this code.

1066.01   PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of Lima residing within the corporation limits and
downstream communities.  This Chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the
following objectives. 
   Specific objectives include the following:
   (A)   To prevent accelerated soil erosion and to control stormwater runoff
resulting from Land Disturbance Activities proposed within the City of Lima,
both during and after construction.
   (B)   To assure that property owners control the volume and rate of
stormwater runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
groundwater quality is protected, soil erosion minimized, and flooding
potential reduced.
   (C)   To preserve and use the natural drainage system for receiving and
conveying stormwater runoff and to minimize the need to construct enclosed,
below-grade storm drain systems.
   (D)   To preserve natural infiltration and the recharge of groundwater and
to maintain subsurface flows which replenish lakes, streams and wetlands.
   (E)   To restrict stormwater runoff entering and leaving development sites
to non-erosive velocities by requiring temporary and permanent soil erosion
control measures.
   (F)   To assure that soil erosion control and stormwater runoff control
systems are incorporated into site planning at an early stage in the planning
and design process.
   (G)   To prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soils,
especially adjacent to lakes, streams, watercourses, and wetlands.
   (H)   To prevent construction activity that may cause mass movement,
slumping, or erosion of land surfaces.
   (I)   To eliminate the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, ditches, streams, lakes, wetlands, and stormwater control
facilities which are the result of inadequate soil erosion and stormwater
runoff control.
   (J)   To reduce long-term expenses and remedial projects which are caused by
uncontrolled stormwater runoff and soil erosion.
   (K)   To encourage the design and construction  of stormwater control
systems which serve multiple purposes, including but not limited to flood
prevention, water quality protection, wildlife habitat preservation, education,
recreation, and wetlands protection.
   (L)   To reduce the detrimental impacts of stormwater flows on downstream
communities.
   (M)   To allow for off-site stormwater control facilities and measures if
proposals meet the requirements of these regulations.
   (N)   To assure that all stormwater control facilities will be properly
designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (O)   To provide for enforcement of this Chapter and penalties for
violations.

than  five degrees between two centerline tangent sections of a street, a curve
of adequate radius shall connect them (See Table 1.) Between reverse curves, a
minimum tangent of 100 feet shall be introduced.
      (3)   Vertical alignment.
         (a)   All changes of grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to twenty times the algebraic difference in the
rate of grade for arterials and industrial streets and fifteen times such
difference for collector and local streets.
         (b)   Minimum vertical visibility shall conform to Table 1 and the
Ohio Department of Transportation's regulations in effect on the date of the
approval of the preliminary plat.
         (c)   No street grade shall be less than 0.60 percent and in no case
shall a street grade be more than three percent within 100 feet of an
intersection.
      (4)   Intersection design standards.
         (a)   The design and improvement standards for intersections are
suggested minimum standards for all street intersections in a subdivision.
These standards are included in Table 1. Streets shall remain tangent for at
least 100 feet beyond the point of intersection. The minimum angle of
intersections shall be seventy-five degrees with ninety-degree intersections
preferred.
         (b)   Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than two
streets are not permitted.
         (c)   Four-way intersections of local streets should be avoided and
threeway or T-intersections should be encouraged wherever possible.

regulations of the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. 221-18.  Passed 9-24-18.)
1242.02   INTERPRETATION; PURPOSES.
   The provisions of this Zoning Code, for purposes of interpretation and
application, shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general
welfare. The lot or yard areas required by this Zoning Code for a particular
building shall not be diminished and shall not be included as a part of the
required lot or yard areas of any other building. The lot or yard areas of
buildings existing on June 6, 1949, shall not be diminished below the
requirements herein provided for buildings hereafter erected, and such required
areas shall not be included as a part of the required areas of any building
hereafter erected. This Zoning Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any
way impair or interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance or any
rules or regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or
issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises. However,
when this Zoning Code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings
or premises or upon the height of buildings or requires larger lots or yards
than are imposed or required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance or
by such rules and regulations, the provisions of this Zoning Code shall
control.
(1956 Code Sec. 1313.02)
1242.03   AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Council may, from time to time, on its own motion or on petition,

established. However, no amendment shall become effective unless it is first
submitted for approval to the Planning Commission, which shall be permitted a
reasonable time for consideration thereof and report thereon. No amendment
disapproved by the Commission shall take effect unless it is passed by two-
thirds of the full membership of Council.
   (B)   If an amendment, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, transfers any
area to another district by changing the district boundaries, the provisions of
this Zoning Code, with regard to buildings or premises existing on or before
June 6, 1949, or buildings for which permits were issued prior to June 6, 1949,
shall apply to existing buildings or premises in such transferred area for
which permits have been issued prior to the passage of such amendment.
(1956 Code Sec. 1313.03)
1242.04   DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   (A)   Submission and Approval; Requirements. The owner of any tract of land
shall submit to the Planning Commission a plan for the use and development of
such tract primarily for residential purposes. If such development plan is
approved, after public notice and hearing, by the Planning Commission and by
Council, the application of the use, height, area and yard regulations
established in this Zoning Code shall be modified as required by such
development plan. However, for the tract as a whole, excluding street area, but
including, area to be devoted to parks, parkways or other permanent open
spaces, there shall be not less than the required area per family, for the area
district in which such tract of land is located, for each family which under
such development plan may be housed on such street. Further, under such
development plan the appropriate use of property adjacent to the area included

1248.04   SIDE YARDS IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   In a Class I Residential, Class II Residential or Class III Residential
District, except where within an Unrestricted Area District, each dwelling and
each apartment house shall be deemed a separate building. For every building
erected, there shall be a side yard along each lot line other than a front line
or a rear line, except that in a Class III Residential District any number of
residences may be built as a continuous structure and be considered as a single
building for the purpose of this section. At least twenty percent of the width
of each lot shall be devoted to side yards, provided that not more than sixteen
feet need be so devoted. The least dimension of a side yard shall not be less
than five feet. However, in the case of any building more than two and one-half
stories in height, such least dimension shall not be less than one-sixth of the
height of the building. Any dwelling house existing on June 6, 1949, and having
side yards that do not comply with the provisions of this section may be
extended along such existing side yard lines.
(1956 Code Sec. 1319.04)
1248.05   SIDE YARD EXCEPTIONS.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1248.04 when a lot in an existing subdivision located in a Residential District
does not exceed fifty-five feet in width, the minimum side yard setback
dimension shall be three feet.
(Ord. 85-52. Passed 5-12-52.)

District, every building erected shall have a rear yard. The least dimension of
a rear yard shall be not less than fifteen percent of the depth of the lot.
However, in the case of any building more than two and one-half stories in
height, such least dimension shall not be less than one-half the height of the
building. Such least dimension need not be more than twenty-five feet in any
case.
(1956 Code Sec. 1319.06)
1248.07   SIDE AND REAR YARD OBSTRUCTIONS.

the established grade, or from the finished grade if higher than the
established grade, to the sky. However, ordinary projections such as window
sills, belt courses, cornices and other ornamental features may project not
more than four inches. When the wall of the building is not within five feet of
the lot line and the building is not over two and one-half stories in height,
the cornice or eaves may project not more than two feet into such yard.

   Between a building line, as herein established, and the street line no
building or portion of a building other than an unenclosed porch may be
erected. In a Class I Residential, Class II Residential or Class III
Residential District, building lines shall be established as follows:
   (A)   On property fronting on any street, a line which is back of the street
line a distance equal to twenty percent of the average or normal depth of the
lot, provided such distance is not less than thirty feet, shall be the building
line for such street frontage. When in any portion of such street frontage
there are lots of markedly less depth than the normal, the Board of Adjustment,
in defining and applying the front yard line regulation established herein,
may, when in its opinion the general purpose and intent of this section will be
better served thereby, divide such street frontage into sections for the
application of the above twenty percent building line requirement.
   (B)   Building lines shall be based on existing alignment in the following
cases:
      (1)   On property fronting upon any street where twenty-five percent or
more of such frontage on the respective side of the street is improved with
residences between two adjacent streets, the average distance back from the
street line of the houses already built in such square shall be the building
line instead of the thirty feet herein established.
      (2)   On property fronting upon any street where sixty percent or more of
such frontage between two adjacent streets is improved with buildings that are
built at the street line, the street shall be the building line for that
square.
   (C)   On property abutting two intersecting streets, the front yard shall be
the yard serving as the principal means of access to the respective residences.
In cases of connected residences having principal access from both streets,
there shall be front yards upon both streets, and each building line shall be
distant from its respective street line twenty percent of the lot dimension as
measured from the respective street line or as otherwise specified herein. In
cases where corner lots are developed with more than one residence building,
the buildings, other than the one bordered by both streets, shall each have
building lines distant from their front street lines twenty percent of the lot
dimensions from such street lines, provided that buildings upon corner lots
shall conform to the alignment of building or yard lines on adjacent lots which
have similar direction of principal dimension in the original plat.
(1956 Code Sec. 1319.08)
1248.09   FRONT YARD EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to vary the building line
requirements of Section
1248.08.
   (B)   Whenever a recorded plat of a subdivision imposes building lines upon
a particular parcel of land, the action of the Board shall have no effect
thereon.
   (C)   Any person may enclose an existing front porch without obtaining a
variance from the Board, provided that:
      (1)   Such enclosure will not expand existing foundation lines or extend
any portion of the building beyond such lines.
      (2)   The written consent of all abutting and adjoining owners is
obtained and filed with the Building and Zoning Administrator prior to
obtaining a building permit.
(Ord. 109-76. Passed 8-2-76.)

1248.09(c)(3) was repealed by Ordinance 192-86, passed December 1, 1986.)
1248.10   VISION CLEARANCE IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   On a corner lot no fence or other structure more than three and one-half
feet in height above the plane of the established grades of the streets shall
be erected on any part of the front yard or side yard herein established that
is included within the street right-of-way lines of intersecting streets and a
line connecting such street lines, at a point which is twenty feet from their
point of intersection measured along such street lines. No planting or foliage
shall be placed or maintained within such area that, in the judgment of the
Zoning Administrator, will materially obstruct the view of a driver of a
vehicle approaching the intersection.
   No fence which is more than three and one-half feet in height above the
plane of the finished grade of the lots at the division line between lots shall
be erected in any part of a front yard or side yard between the front building
line and the front lot line. The provisions of this section shall apply only to

the services of persons using the premises as their private residences and
entailing no external changes in the building and no internal changes in the
structural form of the building, such as the removal of partitions or floors or
parts thereof, shall be permitted. Such permitted uses shall be restricted to
those that are not offensive by reason of the emission of odor, dust, smoke,
gas, noise or vibration, those that are not accompanied by an unreasonable
number of calls or stops by either pedestrians or vehicles and to those that

         (e)   The special permit shall be valid for such period as designated
by the Board of Adjustment, but in no event shall exceed six months. The permit
may, however, be renewed by the Board for a successive six month period.
         (f)   The applicant for the special permit shall submit to the Board
of Adjustment a site plan describing the operation and demonstrating compliance
with the conditions set forth herein.
   (B)   Any use specified in subsection (a) hereof existing in any Use

1256.02   NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   A nonconforming use may be continued until such time as there is an

use prior to June 6, 1949 or prior to annexation, upon which property the work
of changing or remodeling for the nonconforming use has been begun and for
which a building permit has been issued, may be used for the nonconforming use
for which such changing or remodeling was undertaken, notwithstanding any
provision of this Zoning Code to the contrary. Nothing in this Zoning Code

such nonconforming use on or before June 6, 1949 or on or before annexation,
shall be permitted. Further, a building arranged or designed for and devoted to
a nonconforming use on June 6, 1949 or on annexation, which use has been
conducted without abandonment as provided in subsection (a) hereof, may be
reconstructed, structurally altered or enlarged in any lawful manner or to any
extent so as to increase the floor space thereof over that existing on June 6,
1949 or on annexation, by not more than fifty percent (50%), unless the use of
such building is changed to a conforming use. Any building which has been used
for a nonconforming use may be replaced by a new building on the same area,
which new building shall be used for such nonconforming use, such shall not
contain more than one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the floor space of
the replaced building and shall conform to all building regulations of the
City. A nonconforming yard use, operated without abandonment since June 6, 1949
or since annexation, may be housed to provide floor area of not more than that
of the yard so used, upon a special permit as provided in Section

   (b)   Any use authorized in a Class III Residential District may be

1244.05, and according to the provisions of this section.
   (f)   (1)   In addition to the standards and procedures required to be
followed by the Board of Adjustment as set forth in Section
1244.05, except those regarding notification, the Board of Adjustment shall
only grant special use permits pursuant to this section in the following
situations:
         A.   The permitted uses are not anticipated to be offensive because of
additional or unreasonable odor, dust, smoke, gas, noise, or vibration;
         B.   The permitted uses are not anticipated to cause an unreasonable
degree of disturbance or have an adverse impact to the immediate or surrounding
area by an increase in the amount of pedestrians or vehicles, or otherwise be
unsightly or otherwise objectionable;
         C.   The permitted uses are not anticipated to result in unreasonable
diminution in the value of property in the area; and
         D.   All abutting property owners and City Council are given ten days
advance notice of the hearing on the special use permit by regular mail
service, with a Certificate of Mailing issued by the U.S. Postal Service.
      (2)   If the Board denies a requested permit, it shall specify its
reasons for denial, in writing, and serve its decision on the applicant
together with a notice of any rights to appeal the applicant may have.
      (3)   The decision of the Board whether to grant or deny an application
for a special use shall be filed with City Council.
   (g)   The Board of Adjustment is authorized to establish reasonable
conditions and limitations on the allowed use of the property as an expressed
condition of the granting of the special use permit to effect the maintenance
of the standards by which the special permit is issued.  The property owner’s
failure to maintain compliance with such conditions shall be grounds for
revocation of the special use permit.
   (h)   The special use permit shall be transferable to a successor in title,
but is limited to the use and subject to all conditions as originally
authorized by the Board.  Upon the transfer of real estate subject to a special
use permit, the transferor shall provide the City written notice of the
transfer and the name and address of the purchaser within fifteen days of the
transfer.  Failure to provide the required notice may be cause for the Board to
terminate the special use permit and shall be deemed to be a minor misdemeanor
offense, punishable by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (i)   A fee as required in
Chapter 1290 shall be paid with the filing of an application for a special use
permit.  The Board of Adjustment may waive up to ninety percent of the fee for
just cause.
   (j)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the duty to investigate the use
requested and shall make a written report and recommendation to the Board of
Adjustment within forty- five days of the date of the application, or such
later date as may be authorized by the Board.  The Board may require the Zoning
Administrator to submit any additional information the Board determines to be
appropriate for it to consider.
   (k)   The Board shall conduct a hearing on the advisability of issuing a
special use permit within ninety days of the date of the application, or as
soon thereafter as the Board determines is practicable.
   (l)   Notwithstanding any provisions set forth above, Council may, upon its
own motion, review any special use permit considered by the Board of
Adjustment.  Council may thereafter by ordinance reverse, alter, amend, revise,
or otherwise modify any decision of the Board of Adjustment provided such
ordinance is approved by at least two-thirds of the members elected to Council,
within thirty days of Council’s receipt of the Board’s decision.
   (m)   Unless the Board’s decision is modified by Council as provided in
division (l) of this section, the special use permit may only be revoked or
modified after a hearing by the Board and having found the original conditions
of the permit are not being met or remedied after reasonable notice to the
permit holder.  Reasonable notice shall be a period of not less than sixty days
following written notification mailed by regular mail to the permit holder.
   (n)   Any special use permit shall automatically terminate, without
recourse, if the use is abandoned for six consecutive months.  Abandonment
shall mean a cessation of the special use at the location for six consecutive
months, removal of substantially all of any equipment required by the special
use, or modification of the premises in a manner inconsistent with the special
use.
   (o)   Once approved, no change in the specified use or conditions of a
special use permit shall be allowed.  Any proposed change or modification shall
require a new application which shall be considered in every manner as an
original application.
   (p)   The Board may promulgate rules necessary to effectuate the provisions
herein.

      (3)   However, in the event that the governing body of any such public
school, church, library, playground, hospital, orphanage or children's home
files its consent in writing with the Zoning Administrator, a public garage,
garage repair shop or filling station may be erected or established less than
200 feet but not less than fifty feet from the building structure of any such
institution.
   (c)   Stables. No building or structure for housing more than one bovine or
equine animal shall be erected or established which has any part thereof
located within 200 feet of a residence, the distance to be measured as provided
in this section.

height above the grade of the street shall be erected in both directions from
the intersection of the streets.
   (D)   Vision Clearance and Fences.  Because of the particular nature of a
certain lot, should a fence cause an obstruction to vision for vehicular
traffic, the City Engineer has the authority to require that the fence be taken
down, or erected, constructed or maintained at a height that will not obstruct
a vision to vehicular traffic, or to deny the erection, construction or
maintenance of said fence.
   (E)   Construction and Maintenance.  A fence permitted pursuant to this
section shall be maintained in good condition, shall be structurally sound and
installed in a workmanlike manner of materials normally used in fence
construction and acceptable to the City Engineer, and shall be attractively
finished on both sides at all times.  The ground between such fence and the
property line shall be maintained at all times.

1266.01   AUTHORITY; FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Authority.   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the  legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for
promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. 
   (B)   Findings.   The City of Lima has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
1266.02   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
1266.03   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.   
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
1266.04   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Lima as identified in Section
1266.05, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.
1266.05   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.   
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (A)   Flood Insurance Study – Allen County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, and
Flood Insurance Rate Map – Allen County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, effective
May 2, 2013.
   (B)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1266.26 Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   (C)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the office of the City Engineer.
1266.06   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances or
resolutions including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes, not
otherwise repealed herein. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance or resolution, the more restrictive shall be followed.
These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement
but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
1266.07   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
1266.08   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
1266.09   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
1266.10   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (A)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (B)   Appeal. A request for review of the floodplain administrator's

   (I)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (J)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (K)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (L)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (M)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (N)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (O)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (P)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (Q)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 2 feet of freeboard above HAG.  In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (R)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. 
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (S)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (T)   HAG or highest adjacent grade.  The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to the construction next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   (U)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (V)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (W)   LAG or lowest adjacent grade.  The lowest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to the construction next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
   (X)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (Y)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (Z)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a

of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Section 3781.06 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (AA)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (BB)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (CC)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Lima Flood
Insurance Rate Map, February 15, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (DD)   Person.   Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.

Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (JJ)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (NN)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (OO)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections 1266.33 - 1266.37, Appeals and Variances.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
1266.22   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
   (A)   After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other

   (B)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Section
1266.32(A)(2), items (a) and (c)-(e).
   (C)   Alterations of a Watercourse.   For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1266.20(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
1266.33   APPEALS BOARD. 
   (A)   The City of Lima Board of Building Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
administration or enforcement of these regulations.  The Records of the Appeals
Board shall be kept and filed at the City’s Department of Public Works, 50 Town
Square, Lima, OH 45801.
   (B)   The Board shall also authorize variances in accordance with Section
1266.35 of these regulations.
1266.34   FILING APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 21 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
1266.35   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a Variance
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Lima.
   (B)   Public Hearing.   The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a public
hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (C)   Factors.   In considering such variance applications, the Appeals
Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the
following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Criteria for Variance.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (E)   Grant of Variance.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the
purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
these regulations.
   (F)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1266.35(C)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
1266.36   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (A)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires.
   (B)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (C)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (D)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (E)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (F)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (G)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.
   (H)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service may be collected in advance.
   (I)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
1266.37   APPEAL TO THE COURT.
   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such
decision to the Allen County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506
of the Ohio Revised Code.
1266.38   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in
Section
1266.19.
   (B)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation
of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with Section
1266.40.
   (C)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1266.40.
1266.39   NOTICE OF VIOLATION.   
   Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a
violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give notice of such
violation to the person responsible therefore and order compliance with these
regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and order shall:

   (C)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
   (D)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;

the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
1266.40   VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.   
   Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense, and
shall constitute a Third Degree misdemeanor. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.

regulation made thereunder or contrary to a fair interpretation or application
thereof; or

rule or regulation made thereunder, in the specific case, will not be contrary

unless the Design Review Board has first issued a Certificate of

   (B)   A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be required by the Building

(Ord. 188-03. Passed 10-20-03; Ord. 218-05. Passed 11-21-05.)
1409.05   CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS; APPROVAL.
   (A)   When any owner intends to make an Alteration to any Structure or cause
New Construction within the Design Review District, the owner shall first apply
for and obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Design Review Board. 
The application for a Certificate shall be filed with the Building Commissioner
together with such plans, specifications, photographs of the Structure subject
to the proposed Alteration or New Construction, and any other documents or
material that the Design Review Board may from time to time request.  The
Building Commissioner shall immediately transmit such application, documents
and materials to the Design Review Board.
   (B)   Within thirty (30) days of filing of the application with the Building
Commissioner, the Board shall consider the application and all supporting
material and determine 1) whether any Alteration or New Construction as defined
in this Chapter is involved, and 2) whether a Certificate of Appropriateness
should be issued or denied.  If the Board determines that no Alteration or New
Construction is involved the Certificate of Appropriateness shall be approved
and forwarded to the applicant.  A copy of the approved Certificate and all
application materials shall be returned to the Building Commissioner.  If the
Board fails to act on an application within thirty (30) days of filing, the
application shall be deemed approved, unless the owner consents, in writing, to
an extension of the 30 day period.
   (C)   In the event the Design Review Board finds that an Alteration or New
Construction is involved in the work proposed in the application, the Board
shall determine whether the proposed Alteration or New Construction is
consistent or inconsistent with the Downtown Lima Design Guidelines (Appendix
A).  In the case of archeological properties, the Design Review Board shall
refer to the current edition of the “Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation’s Treatment of Archeological Properties: A Handbook.”  If the
Board finds that the proposed Alteration or New Construction is consistent with
the Guidelines or Handbook, then the Board shall approve and issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness to the Owner.
   A copy of the approved Certificate and all application materials shall be
returned to the Building Commissioner.
   (D)   In the event the Design Review Board determines within the thirty (30)
day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness should not be issued,
it shall issue a conditional denial of the application and state in writing the
reason for such determination, and shall include recommendations with respect
to the proposed work.  The Board shall forthwith notify the Applicant and the
Building Commissioner of such determination and transmit to the Applicant a
copy of the reasons for the conditional denial, along with any recommendations
by the Review Board.
   (E)   Upon issuing a conditional denial the Design Review Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days, but not to exceed ninety (90)
days from the date of denial. During this time the Board shall negotiate with
the Applicant in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both
parties.  The first meeting between the Board and the Applicant shall be held
within thirty (30) days from the date of the conditional denial of the
Certificate of Appropriateness.  If a compromise proposal is accepted by both
parties, the Board may issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the revised
application.
   (F)   In the case of a conditional denial of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for any Alteration or New Construction not including
demolition:
      (1)   The Design Review Board and the Applicant shall undertake
meaningful and continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find
an alternative to the proposed Alteration or New Construction.  If the Board
and the Applicant do not agree on an alternative solution at the initial
meeting, then they must continue to undertake meaningful discussions for the
purpose of seeking a compromise solution, and such good faith meetings shall be
held at least every thirty(30) days after the initial meeting, not to extend
beyond the waiting period unless agreed to in writing by the Applicant.
      (2)   If, after holding such good faith meetings during the waiting
period, the Board determines that a failure to issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the Applicant, and that
such Certificate may be issued without substantial detriment to the public
welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of this Chapter,
then, the Board shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed
Alteration or New Construction to the Applicant.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meetings during the waiting
period, no alternative solution to the proposed Alteration or New Construction
is reached, or if the Applicant fails to meet with the Design Review Board in
good faith at the time specified, then the Board shall issue a final denial of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (G)   In the case of a conditional denial of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for demolition:
      (1)   The Design Review Board and the Applicant shall undertake a
meaningful and continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find
a means of preserving the Structure.  The Board and the Applicant shall
investigate all means of preserving the Structure.  If the Board and the
Applicant do not agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial
meeting, then they must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing
discussions for the purpose of finding a method of saving the Structure, and
such good faith meetings shall be held at least every thirty(30) days after the
initial meeting, not to extend beyond the waiting period unless agreed to in
writing by the Applicant.
      (2)   If, after holding such good faith meetings during the waiting
period, the Design Review Board determines that a failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
Applicant, and that such Certificate may be issued without substantial
detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the
purposes of this Chapter, then the Board shall issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness for such proposed demolition.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meetings during the waiting
period, no alternative property use is developed, or no offer to save the
structure is made by the Applicant, the Design Review Board, or a third party,
or if the Applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the time
specified, then the Board shall issue a final denial of the application.
(Ord. 218-05. Passed 11-21-05.)
1409.06   APPEALS.
   Any Applicant who receives a final denial of an Application to Alter a
Structure or New Construction may appeal the decision of the Design Review
Board to the Lima City Council by serving a notice of the appeal to the Clerk
of Council within fourteen (14) days of the date of the decision of final
denial.  Such appeal shall be heard by Council as an administrative appeal. 
Council may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the Review Board as it
determines to be appropriate.  Any person adversely affected by a decision of
Council under this Chapter may appeal to the Allen County Common Pleas Court,
according to law.

provided such work involves no change in material, design, texture, or outer
appearance.  Any Alteration of any Structure which in the view of the Building
Commissioner is required or desirable for the public health or safety because
of an unsafe or dangerous condition shall not be subject to the provisions of
this Chapter, as may be determined in the discretion of the Building
Commissioner.
(Ord. 141-01. Passed 9-24-01.)

State shall pay a claim of the named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (A)   (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds
and the company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) or
Ohio R.C. 505.86, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Building
Commissioner in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000.00), and each fraction of that amount, of a claim. 
However, if, at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured
or insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named insured or
insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, then the
insurance company or companies shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate.
      (2)   The Building Commissioner or his or her designee shall establish
the criteria for securing such structure and/or such property.
      (3)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or other structure.  Policy proceeds remaining
after the transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy
terms.
      (4)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure.  After the transfer, the Building Commissioner shall return the
amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds,
provided that the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
   (B)   (1)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this
section, the Building Commissioner shall place the proceeds in a separate fund
to be used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (2)   When transferring the funds as required in division (a) of this
section, an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address
of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named
insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City,
and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
         (a)   The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when
securing and removal or repairs of the building or other structure have been
completed, as approved by the Building Commissioner, and the required proof has
been received by the Building Commissioner. 
         (b)   If the City has not incurred any costs for such repairs, removal
or securing, the City shall transfer the fund to the named insured or insureds
no later than 60 days after the Building Commissioner receives the required
proof that the building or other structure has been secured and removed or
repaired as approved by the Building Commissioner. 
         (c)   If the City has incurred any costs for the repairs, removal or
securing of the building or other structure, such costs shall be paid from the
fund, and if excess funds remain, the Building Commissioner shall transfer the

on which the building exists or existed, to be added to the tax duplicate as an
assessment, to be levied as a special tax against the land upon which the
building exists or existed or to be recovered in a suit at law against the
owner. However, the Mayor may, in cases where it is desirable and where any

shall cause the same to be paid and levied as a tax assessment against the
property. 
   (C)   Any cost incurred under subsection (B) hereof shall be paid out of the

persons failing to comply with the notice and order provided for in Section

material derived in the abatement, he may sell such material at private or
public sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an account of the
proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in the General
Fund. Any difference between the amount so received and the cost of the
abatement shall be levied as an assessment against the property by Council,
certified to the County Auditor and collected as any other assessment by the
City. Should the proceeds of such sale exceed the cost of abatement, the
surplus shall be paid to the owner of the premises when his proper claim
therefor is established. In abating such nuisance, the Mayor may, by private
contract, obtain the abatement thereof, if such private contract may be let
without any expense to the City.

dangerous building. The cost of such emergency repair, vacation or demolition

   (A)   Permit Required. No person shall erect, convert, repair, alter, or
enlarge any  mechanical system or part thereof without first obtaining a
mechanical permit therefor, as provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   Submission; plans and specifications.
         (a)   The application for a permit required by division (A) of this
section shall be made in writing on approved forms and shall be accompanied by
three complete sets of dimensional plans, showing each habitable floor,
basement and cellar, and by specifications describing the kind, size, quality
and grade of all construction materials and service equipment. Such plans and
specifications shall be examined by the Building Commissioner. The plans shall
be forwarded to other departments of the City, if necessary to determine
compliance with those laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction. If the
Building Commissioner is satisfied that the work described on the application
and the plans filed therewith conform to the requirements of this Mechanical
Code and other applicable laws and ordinances, he or she shall issue a permit
therefor to the applicant.
         (b)   The Building Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing
plans when the work involved is of a minor nature and the building operation is
adequately described in the application. All plans submitted for filing shall
be prepared and signed as required by State law. When compliance with State law
is required, the application shall be accompanied by a set of the plans
approved by the proper authority. The Building Commissioner may require plans
and specifications to be prepared and designed by an engineer or architect
licensed by the State to practice as such. Computations, stress diagrams and
other pertinent data sufficient to show the correctness of the plan shall be
submitted when required by the Building Commissioner.
   (C)   Approved Plans. One copy of the approved plans and specifications,
together with the signed permit, shall be kept at the site of the operation at
all times that the work is in progress and until completion of the mechanical
system. One set of the approved plans of every mechanical system shall be kept
on file in the office of the Building Commissioner as a permanent official
record. After issuance of a mechanical permit, the approved plans and
specifications shall not be altered unless any proposed change is first
approved by the Building Commissioner in conformity with the provisions of this
Mechanical Code.
      (1)   Expiration.  Every permit issued by the Building Commissioner under
provision of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if
the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one hundred and
eighty (180) days from the issue date of the permit, or if the work authorized
by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days or more after
the work has been commenced.  Before such work can be commenced or resumed, a
permit extension or renewal as required by
1444.01(c)(2) or
1444.01(c)(3) shall be obtained.
      (2)   Permit Extensions.  A holder of an unexpired permit may apply for a
one-time 180-day extension, provided the permit holder can show good and
satisfactory reasons, beyond the control of the permit holder, that the work
cannot be commenced within the 180 day period from the original permit issue
date.  No additional fee is required for this one- time extension.
      (3)   Permit Renewal.  A permit which has expired for 180 days or less
may be renewed provided no changes have been made in the original plans and
specifications for such work.  The renewal fee shall be one half the amount
required for a new permit.  Permits which have been expired for greater than
180 days require a new application and payment of the full permit fee.
   (D)   Permit for Partial Construction. The Building Commissioner may issue a
permit for the construction of part of a mechanical system before the plans and
specifications for the entire building or structure have been submitted or
approved, provided that adequate information and detailed statements have been
filed complying with all applicable requirements of this Mechanical Code. The
holder of such permit shall proceed at his or her own risk, without assurance
that the permit for the entire system will be granted.
(Ord. 096-10. Passed 4-19-10.)
1444.02   PERMIT REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   In addition to any other provision set forth in this chapter, a permit shall
be subject to revocation or suspension by the Building Commissioner whenever it
appears that the work for which the permit was issued is being installed,
erected, constructed, altered, repaired, added to, demolished or disposed of in
violation of any of the terms upon which the permit was issued, in violation of
any provisions of this Mechanical Code or any law or ordinance relating
thereto, for failure or refusal to comply with any lawful order made by the
Building Commissioner under the provisions of this Mechanical Code, or if the
Building Commissioner determines that any of the information supplied by the
applicant is false, incorrect, or otherwise misleading.  The revocation or
suspension of the permit shall be in writing, shall be served by the Building
Commissioner upon the person or other entity the permit is issued to, and shall
be posted upon the building or structure for which the permit was granted. 
From and after the permit revocation or suspension and the posting thereof, all
labor shall be discontinued on any and all portions of the structure for which
the permit was granted.
(Ord. 096-10. Passed 4-19-10.)
1444.03   FEES.
      A.   Before receiving a mechanical permit, an owner or his or her agent
shall pay the fees provided in division (F) of this section.  Such fees shall
include the costs of the prescribed inspections to determine whether or not the
actual construction or alteration permitted is in conformity with this
Mechanical Code.
      B.   When work for which a permit is required by this Mechanical Code is
begun prior to obtaining a permit, the fees shall be doubled.  However, the
payment of the doubled fees shall not relieve any person from full compliance
with the requirements of this Mechanical Code, in the execution of the work, or
from any penalty provided.  In no event shall the penalty portion of the
doubled fees exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).
      C.   If there are any changes in the plans and specifications at any time
before the completion of the work for which the permit has been granted, if
such changes are in compliance with this Mechanical Code and if such changes or
additions increase the cost of the work to be done, the permit fee shall be

architectural, or historic character of the structure and property pursuant to
the design criteria established by this chapter;
      (2)   Consistent with the spirit and purposes of this chapter and the

as found in the Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 67.7;
      (3)   In concert with the Archeological Guidelines as prepared by the
OHPO;
      (4)   In accordance with the following considerations regarding

character of the area and the City, and will be an improvement of existing
conditions;
         B.   The applicant has adequately documented the existing structure

AND NEW CONSTRUCTION) TO DESIGNATED RESOURCES.
   (a)   No person shall demolish or make any alteration or change to any
designated property without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness.
   (b)   The Historic Preservation Board shall make a determination on an
application for a certificate of appropriateness within thirty days of the
filing of the action unless the applicant approves an extension of time. The
Historic Preservation Board may also table the application for additional
information, or for lack of information or clarification until the next meeting
or for a specific period of time. If the Board fails to render its decision
within sixty days, the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall
be deemed approved.  This provision shall not apply if the application is
tabled due to lack of information provided by the applicant, or due to the
applicant requesting that the application remain tabled.
   (c)   In making such a determination, the Historic Preservation Board shall
refer to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, and to
the design guidelines adopted by the Historic Preservation Board.
   (d)   In addition to the above procedures, if an application for a
certificate of appropriateness seeks approval of demolition, the Historic
Preservation Board may delay determination of the application for a period of
sixty days upon a finding that the structure is of such importance that
alternatives to demolition may be feasible and should be actively pursued by
both the applicant and the Historic Preservation Board.  In the event that
action on an application is delayed as provided herein, the Historic
Preservation Board may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the
structure in accordance with the purposes of this section.  Such steps may
include but are not limited to, consultation with civic groups, public
agencies, and interested citizens, marketing plans, recommendations for
acquisition of the property by public or private bodies or agencies, and
exploration of the possibility of moving the structure or structures.
   (e)   Following its review, the Historic Preservation Board shall either:
      (1)   Approve the certificate of appropriateness as submitted;
      (2)   Approve the certificate of appropriateness subject to specific
conditions; or
      (3)   Deny the certificate of appropriateness.
   (f)   A certificate of appropriateness shall be conditional upon the
commencement of work within one year of issuance.  If work has not commenced
within one year of issuance or work has not been more than fifty percent
completed within one and one-half years of issuance, the certificate shall
expire and be revoked.
   (g)   Design Criteria.  The following design criteria shall apply to all

character, historical significance, and architectural style of the existing
buildings, site elements, structures, and property.  Such changes shall be
visually compatible with the subject structure, property, and area.
      (2)   Materials.  Traditional building materials such as wood, brick, or
stone shall be used for construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or
other exterior structure or site element change.  Modern man-made materials may
be utilized at the discretion of the Board if the proposed project keeps in
character with the existing building, site, area structures, and the Board’s
Guidelines.
      (3)   Building massing.  For new construction and additions, the
structure’s width, height, surrounding setbacks, and style shall be considered
in relation to adjacent structures.  This relationship between structures shall
allow for consistency of style, size, and density in each given neighborhood
area.
      (4)   Enhancement of pedestrian environment.  Where possible, elements
which can contribute to the quality of the pedestrian environment and other
public amenities should be promoted.  Included among these may be benches,
water features, seating areas, arcades, awnings, or canopies.

designed to coalesce with the subject building, site and area.

   (B)   Abatement Plan. Within 10 days of the issuance of the order to abate
the public nuisance, the owner shall file an abatement plan which must include
one of the following terms
      (1)   Rehabilitation Plan.  A plan that sets forth a practicable
rehabilitation schedule designed to eliminate any condition constituting a
public nuisance.  The Drug House  Nuisance Administrator will not approve plans
that do not remove all nuisances within a three (3) month period;
      (2)   Property Sales Plan.  A plan that places the property for sale with

accompanied by a properly issued demolition permit. 
   (C)   Terms of Plans

months following the finding of the public nuisance.  The Drug House  Nuisance

period, not to exceed three (3) months, for good cause, and upon proper showing
of substantial work completed on the plan, or extreme hardship. 
      (2)   Financial Ability.  Additionally the owner must present information

The Drug House  Nuisance Administrator will provide information to the owner
regarding financial assistance that may be available through City programming.
   (D)   Plan Approval.  The Drug House  Nuisance Administrator shall examine
the owner’s proposal and timetable to see if it is a reasonable response which
will eliminate the nuisance condition on the premises or related to a
structure.  If the Drug House  Nuisance Administrator determines that the
proposed timetable outlined to rehabilitate, sell, or demolish is reasonable
and the proposed work will result in bringing the structure into compliance
with the law, then the owner’s proposal shall be approved and become an order
of the Drug House Nuisance Administrator. 
   (E)   Plan Disapproval.  If the Drug House  Nuisance Administrator
determines that the timetable is unreasonable, or that the proposed work
program will not bring the structure or premises in compliance with law or that
there is no financial ability to  complete the work program, the Drug House 
Nuisance Administrator shall disapprove the proposal, state the reasons
therefore in writing, and the City shall continue enforcement of the abatement
order to require securing of the structure, sale of property, rehabilitation,
demolition, or other applicable terms. 
   (F)   Abatement Costs.  If the owner fails to abate the nuisance within the
10-day period following the finding of the public nuisance or otherwise fails
to respond with an appropriate abatement plan, the Drug House  Nuisance
Administrator, may issue a supplemental order requiring the owner to abate the
nuisance or pay costs to the City for such abatement.  Such costs may be
