575.0.0 CONSERVATION OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT
(Adopted March, 2010)
575.1.0 AUTHORITY & PURPOSE
This Conservation Open Space Development (COSD) is authorized and enacted in accordance
with RSA 674:21. This COSD ordinance is intended to enhance and protect the health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare of the residents of Litchfield while encouraging flexibility in
the design and development of land, promote environmentally sound planning, conserve open
space, retain and protect important natural and cultural features, provide for efficient use of land
and community services, and preserve the traditional rural character of Litchfield to advance the
goals stated in the master plan.
575.2.0 OBJECTIVES
A. To preserve the natural beauty and rural character, preserve farmland, forests, and provide
open space that serves as wildlife corridors, greenways, and provides the opportunity for
light and passive recreation opportunities in close proximity to dwellings.
B. To discourage sprawl by reducing the footprint of subdivisions by more efficient use of the
land, which allows for reduced road length and associated water lines and utilities, less
consumption of rural and agricultural land, preservation of those areas of the site that have
the highest ecological value including wildlife habitat areas of highest condition identified
based on NH Fish and Game’s Wildlife Action Plan, drinking water supply areas,
watersheds, wetlands, brooks and rivers.
C. To locate buildings and structures on those portions of the site that are the most appropriate
for development and avoiding developing in areas ill-suited for development, including
areas with historic, archeological, and cultural features, poor soil conditions, high water
table, which may be subject to frequent flooding.
D. To create a contiguous network of open spaces or “greenways” by linking the common
open spaces within the subdivision and to open space on adjoining lands wherever possible.
E. To reduce the impacts on water resources by minimizing land disturbance and the creation
of impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff.
F. To provide alternative housing opportunities that meet the needs of residents of varying age,
income and need.

575.4.0 APPLICABILITY
To facilitate the purpose and objectives of this ordinance and achieve the goals in the Litchfield
Master Plan, all subdivisions twenty (20) acres or greater intended for residential use shall use a
Conservation Open Space Development (COSD) design approach, unless the applicant can
demonstrate mitigating circumstances that prevent such a development or the application is
granted a conditional use permit as detailed in the following paragraph.
575.4.1 Authorization to Issue a Conditional Use Permit:
Authority is hereby granted to the Planning Board, as allowed under RSA 674:21, II, and under
section 406 of Litchfield’s Zoning ordinance, to issue a conditional use permit to modify the
requirements of this section as follows:
A. The Planning Board may issue a conditional use permit for the parcel to be developed as a
conventional subdivision when it finds that:
1. The parcel is ill-suited for development using Conservation Open Space Development
design, or a conventional design provides greater or equal benefits to the community;
and the conventional subdivision design retains and protects important natural and/or
cultural features identified by the Planning Board and/or the site inventory, or;
2. The subdivision creates lots that are equal to or greater than eleven (11) acres and each
lot created has existing deed restrictions prohibiting further subdivision, or:
3. The subdivision creates not more than one (1) additional lot accommodating one (1)
dwelling unit, or;
4. The subdivision creates five (5) or fewer dwelling units and does not require a road, or;
5. The proposal is for Workforce Housing and meets 575.4.1 A, 1 above, or demonstrates
it is not economically viable under COSD (Incentives do not apply to COSD standards),
or;
6. Public water is not available to the site.
B. The Planning Board may issue a conditional use permit for a modified Conservation Open
Space Development design to allow for variations from certain requirements of this section
as specified herein. Such modifications shall be consistent with the purposes and standards
of this section; fall within the guidelines contained herein, and shall not be detrimental to
public health, safety or welfare.

575.4.2 Sequential Subdivisions:
The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to the sequenced development of a parent parcel over
time through separate successive applications. When a subdivision is proposed that involves part
of a larger parcel or includes lots that are capable of further subdivision, the Planning Board may
require that a site inventory and a conceptual (non-binding) long-range plan be submitted for the
entire parcel and used to evaluate the proposed subdivision.
575.4.3 Review Process:
A. A subdivision application under this section shall comply with the application and review
process specified in the subdivision regulations.
B. Subdivision plans shall comply with any additional applicable standards that govern the
location and layout of lots and structures found elsewhere in this ordinance and as set forth
in the Subdivision Regulations, except where in conflict with COSD standards.
C. The Planning Board strongly encourages pre-application review. The preliminary review
shall be informational and shall not bind the applicant or the Planning Board. However, the
Planning Board shall be entitled to make recommendations with respect to the material
presented during the preliminary review to assist the potential applicant in preparing a
formal application. (E.g. Site Context Map, Site Inventory Map, Conceptual Plan) No
decisions relative to the plan shall be made at the preliminary review.
A conceptual plan is required. Applicants shall demonstrate that their conceptual plan is
consistent with the following approach for designing a subdivision:
1. Step One: Identify Conservation Areas. Identify those areas of the parcel containing
or supporting important natural resource features and functions, as listed in the
subdivision regulations or otherwise identified by the Planning Board for priority
consideration for inclusion within the designated open space. If not included in the
designated open space, other protective mechanisms, such as a substantial setback of
development or maintenance of an undisturbed buffer around the feature, shall be
identified.
2. Step Two: Locate House Sites and Building Envelopes. To the maximum extent
feasible, house sites and building envelopes shall be located outside of those areas
delineated in Step One. The location of the house sites and building envelopes shall also
reflect the design objectives identified elsewhere.
3. Step Three: Align Streets and Trails. The minimum length and network of streets
necessary to access each house lot shall be identified, subject to the road standards of
the Town and with consideration given to conforming the street to the natural landscape.
Proposed trails shall be identified where access to the designated open space is
appropriate and/or to provide for pedestrian circulation within the development as well
as pedestrian access to areas outside the development.
4. Step Four: Identify Lot Lines. Lot lines for each house site, or group of homes on a
common lot, shall be identified. The placement of the lot lines shall give consideration
to those areas identified in Step One as well as conform to the natural features of the
landscape to the greatest extent possible, e.g., follow stone walls, lines of boundary

trees, streams. The delineation of lots shall also consider the privacy provided for
individual homeowners and opportunity for future owners to reasonably expand the
structures on the lot.
575.4.4 Legal Review:
Prior to final approval by the Planning Board, the applicant shall submit for review and
approval by Litchfield’s Town Counsel any restrictive covenants, condominium or
cooperative agreements, conservation easement, deed restrictions, or other legal agreements
proposed for use in the Conservation Open Space Development. The applicant shall pay all
associated costs of the legal review.

photographically document the building. The Commission shall also encourage the applicant
to salvage significant architectural features.
1044.02 Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent immediate demolition where public safety
is at stake and the building has been determined by the Code Enforcement Officer and Fire
Chief to be a public hazard and demolition is the only viable recourse. Such a determination is
to be made within three (3) business days of the application filing. Every attempt will be made

In recognition of the requirements of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, this
ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of Litchfield,
telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of
telecommunications facilities within the town so as to ensure coordinated development of
communications infrastructure while preserving the health, safety and welfare of the Town and
its residents. This ordinance establishes general guidelines for the siting of
telecommunications towers and antennas to enhance and fulfill the following goals:
a. Preserve the authority of Litchfield to regulate and to provide for reasonable opportunity
for the siting of telecommunications facilities, by enhancing the ability of providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively, and efficiently;
b. Reduce adverse impacts such facilities may create, including, but not limited to, impacts
on aesthetics, environmentally sensitive areas, historically significant locations, flight
corridors, health and safety by injurious accidents to person and property, and prosperity
through protection of property values;
c. Provide for co-location and minimal impact siting options through assessment of
technology, current location options, future available locations, innovative siting
techniques, and siting possibilities beyond the political jurisdiction of the Town;
d. Permit the construction of new towers only where all other reasonable opportunities have
been exhausted, and to encourage the users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas;
e. Require cooperation and co-location, to the highest extent possible; between competitors
in order to reduce cumulative negative impacts upon the Town;
f. Provide for constant maintenance and safety inspections for any and all facilities;
g. Provide for the removal of abandoned facilities that are no longer inspected for safety
concerns and Building code compliance. Provide a mechanism for the Town to remove
these abandoned towers to protect the citizens from imminent harm and danger; and
h. Provide for the removal or upgrade of facilities that are technologically outdated.
1051.00 Definitions.
1051.01 Alternative tower structure. Innovative siting techniques such as artificial trees, clock towers,
bell towers, steeples, light poles, and similar alternative design mounting structures that
camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.

1200.00 WETLANDS CONSERVATION DISTRICT (Amended March 2001)
1200.01 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the public health, safety and
general welfare by controlling and guiding the use of land areas which have been found to be
subjected to high water tables for extended periods of time. It is intended that this ordinance
shall:
a. Prevent the development of structures and land uses on and around naturally occurring and
artificial wetlands, because those structures and land uses may contribute to pollution of
surface and groundwater by sewage or toxic substances.
b. Prevent the destruction of, or significant changes to, natural and artificial wetlands. These
wetlands provide many functions such as flood protection, ground water recharge, pollution
abatement, and water storage for later discharge to enhance stream flow during dry periods.
c. Protect unique, ecologically sensitive and unusual natural areas.
d. Protect wildlife habitats, wildlife corridors and maintain ecological balances.
e. Protect potential water supplies and existing aquifers (water-bearing stratum) and aquifer
recharge areas.
f. Prevent expenditure of municipal funds for the purpose of providing and/or maintaining
essential services and utilities, which might be required as a result of misuse or abuse of
wetlands.
g. Encourage those low-intensity uses that can be harmoniously, appropriately and safely
located in or near wetlands.
1201.00 Definitions. See Section 200.26 for the definition of wetlands.
1201.01 Swamps. The vegetation community typically consists mostly of trees and woody shrubs,
including:
Alders Poison Sumac Arrow-wood
Red Maple Atlantic White Cedar Rhodora
Black Ash Sphaghum Moss Spicebush
Black Spruce Sweet Pepperbush Buttonbush
Tamarack (Larch) Common Elder Willows
High-bush Blueberry Winterberry March Rose
Black Gum
1201.02 Marshes. Treeless wetlands dominated by soft-stemmed herbaceous plants. The surface of the
marsh is covered with water year round, though seasonal fluctuations in water depth are expected.
Marshes range from the wet meadow variety to deep marshes, which can be covered with several
feet of water. The vegetation community is typically made up of some or all of the following:
Arums Leatherleaf Bladderworts
Pickerel Weeds Bur-weeds Rushes
Sedges, including Bullrushes Duckweeds Cotton-grasses & Wool-grasses
Eelgrass Smartweeds Frog's-bits
Sweet Gale Horsetails Water-lillies
Wetland Grasses Water Milfoil Cat-tails

ZONING ORDINANCE
01-225LIT-2018_ZN_Ord.doc.doc Page 65. Amended March 2018
1201.03 Bogs consist of peat or muck deposits of significant depths and are characterized by a distinct
group of trees and plants, which are adapted to the bog's highly acidic conditions. The water in a
bog is practically devoid of oxygen and nutrients. Bogs usually develop in undrained glacial
depressions. Typical plants are:
Atlantic White Cedar Pale Laurel Black Spruce
Pitcher-plants Bladderworts Rhodora
Bog or Buckbean Sedges Bog-laurel
Sheep Laurel Bog-rosemary Sphagnum Moss
High-bush Blueberry Sweet Gale Leatherleaf
1201.04 Wetland Soils. Soil series and land types commonly associated with wetlands, as described by the
Soil Survey of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, Eastern part, dated October, 1981,
including, "very poorly drained" and "poorly drained" soils:
1201.05 Artificial Wetlands. Wetlands that were created during mitigation for wetland losses due to
approved construction or wetland violations.
1201.06 Vernal Pools. Temporary bodies of water varying in size that provide essential breeding habitat
for certain amphibians and invertebrates, but does not support fish, as defined in Identification
and Documentation of Vernal Pools in New Hampshire; published by the New Hampshire Fish
and Games Department (1997), as amended.
1201.07 Fen (groundwater / seepage wetlands). Sedgey / shrubby peatlands influenced by groundwater
seepage and/or water of streams and lakes. More minerotrophic compared to bogs. Water
fluctuations are less pronounced that in marshes. Water quality / pH has a strong influence.
They can be found as groundwater basins, drainageways, bases of slopes, sloping upland til
positions, and riverbanks.
1201.08 Basin Marshes and sandy pondshore marshes. Wetlands that have broadly fluctuating ground or
surface water levels from spring inundation to nearly dry late summer drawdown. They occur on
porous substrates of sandy pondshores, outwash, glacial lakebed and river plain deposits. They
have feeding and breeding ground for amphibians and reptiles.
1201.09 Buffer. A naturally vegetated upland area adjacent to a wetland or surface water. "Naturally
vegetated" includes uncut or undisturbed forest and abandoned pasture or fields. Buffers reduce
the adverse effect of human activities on the wetland or surface water by protecting water quality,
protecting and providing wildlife habitat, reducing direct human disturbance from dumped debris,
noise, carnivorous pets, and many other possible effects. Buffers help to maintain biodiversity,
aesthetic diversity and recreational value.
1202.00 Wetland Delineation.
Wetlands shall be determined by using Field Indicators for Identifying Hydric Soils in New
England. Version 2, New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, 1998, and the
1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual, as amended.

1203.00 Wetlands Incorrectly Delineated.
Where it is alleged that an area has been incorrectly delineated as a wetland, or that an area not so
designated meets the criteria for wetlands designation, the Conservation Commission shall
determine whether the area has been correctly delineated. The Conservation Commission shall
make their judgment under this section only upon the determination by a certified wetlands
scientist(s) on the basis of additional on-site investigation or other suitable research, that the
information contained on the Wetlands Map is incorrect. This evidence shall be acceptable only
when presented in written form by said scientist(s) to the Conservation Commission. Any
necessary wetlands delineation procedures shall be conducted at the expense of the landowner or
developer. Once an area has been determined to be a wetland under this section, the area shall
become part of the Wetland Conservation District. (Adopted March 1987)
1204.00 Wetlands Conservation District Boundaries
The limits of the Wetlands Conservation District are hereby determined to be wetland areas and
surface waters of 2,000 square feet or more in size; or wetland areas of any size if contiguous to

2100.00 GROWTH MANAGEMENT (Expires May 1, 2010)
(Adopted March 2000; Amended March 2001)
2100.01 Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to RSA 674:16-17 and 674:22.
2100.02 Findings. As documented in the Litchfield Master Plan, the Town hereby finds that:
a. Litchfield’s developable land resources are sufficient to support extensive new growth and
development. A 1997 Town of Litchfield Buildout Analysis estimated there were 2,258
acres of Developable Land Area (DLA) in residential districts in 1996. Assuming 139
acres were used for new residential development in 1997 to 1998, that it is a Planning
Board desire to preserve 320 acres of prime agricultural lands from residential
development, and assuming 20% of remaining DLA is reserved for roads and utilities,
1,439 acres of DLA remain in residential zones in 1999. Using a 1990 to 1998 housing
unit uncompounded growth rate of 3.3% annually (61 new units per year) it is probable
that residential buildout will be reached by 2022.
b. Litchfield’s population increased 32.9% from 1980 to 1990 and 24.1% from 1990 to 1998,
for an overall increase of 64.9%, or 3.6% annually over the 18-year period.
c. The number of housing units in Litchfield increased 39.9% from 1980 to 1990. The rate
of housing growth was another 26.5%, from 1990 to 1998, representing a 1990 to 1998
period growth rate of 3.3 % annually.
d. Litchfield’s housing growth rate is greater than the region’s. As shown in Table V-24 of
the December 7, 1999 Population and Housing Chapter of the Litchfield Master Plan,
based on U.S. Census building permit data and building permits issued data in the
Litchfield Annual Reports, from 1990 to 1998, the average annual rate of new unit
construction in Litchfield is 1.5% higher than the average for a Litchfield fair share region
that consists of Litchfield and the five adjacent communities: Hudson, Londonderry,
Manchester, Merrimack and Nashua. The 3.3% annual rate of new housing construction
in Litchfield is second highest in the Nashua Regional Planning Commission (NRPC)
region to Brookline at 5.8%. Similarly, of 15 New Hampshire communities adjacent to or
1 municipality away from Litchfield, the only local growth rate higher than Litchfield is
Bedford at 4.6% annually.
e. Population projections for Litchfield by the NH Office of State Planning (OSP) in 1998
project a 2,982 person, or 44.6% increase in population from 1997 to 2010.
f. High levels of demand for housing in Litchfield are expected to continue according to the
1999 Regional Housing Needs Assessment by NRPC. With the region divided into four
parts, the eastern region towns Litchfield, Hudson and Pelham had the largest increase in
number of sales in 1991 to 1998 at 116 percent.
g. According to analysis by the Litchfield Economic Development Working Group, a
subcommittee of the Planning Board, the proposed Circumferential Highway and the
Airport Connector Access Road present potential to increase the pace of residential
growth to levels above those experienced from 1970 to 1999. This is due to the easy
access to interstate highways that these projects will generate.
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
01-225LIT-2018_ZN_Ord.doc.doc Page 99. Amended March 2018
h. Growth is stimulating increasing demand for Town school facilities. According to the
August 18, 1998 Litchfield School Building Committee, Report to the School Board,
Elementary School Space Evaluation, the stated capacity of Griffin Memorial (elementary)
School (GMS) is 500 students and with an ideal number of classrooms equaling 21. The
Litchfield Middle School (LMS) core capacity is 500 including recent additions and the
ideal classroom number is 20. Based on 1999 enrollments, GMS is at 100% of capacity
and LMS is at 98% of capacity. The 1998 – 2003 Litchfield Capital Improvements
Program Update notes that the School Board is evaluating different school space
alternatives to address overcrowding.
i. Much of the Litchfield public sector is straining to meet projected service and facility
demands. Town facilities at Liberty Way are adequate for current population but need
expansion to adequately accommodate personnel and storage needs associated with new
development. Two new fire substations need to be constructed; a portion of which will
service new residential and commercial development. There are many categories of
recreational facilities where the Town does not meet the recommended service level for a
municipality the size of Litchfield.
j. As of November 17, 1999 the Town finds that the Litchfield Fair Share Region Average
Growth Rate is 1.5%.
k. Based on the limitations listed above, the Town finds that as of November 17, 1999 this
growth management ordinance is in effect.
2100.03 Purpose. The Town finds the purposes of this section of the Zoning Ordinance to:
a. Promote the development of an economically sound and environmentally stable
community, which considers and balances local and regional development needs.
b. Guide efforts by the Town to monitor, evaluate, and establish a rate of residential growth
in Litchfield that is consistent with the municipal capacity for planned, orderly, and
sensible expansion of local public services to accommodate growth.
c. Provide a mechanism to control the growth of development of residential projects to
manage the impact on municipal services.
d. Provide a mechanism when and where municipal services are strained to reduce the rate of
residential growth to allow the Town time to correct such deficiencies.
e. Protect the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of Town residents.
f. Address community development goals in the Town of Litchfield Master Plan.
g. Address public facility needs in the Town Capital Improvements Plan.
h. Establish a policy mechanism to moderate a rapid rate of local residential growth
compared with adjacent communities. Therefore, the main purpose is to institute a
maximum growth rate on new residential construction. This sustainable rate of
development is based on the average percentage increase in building permits issued in
Litchfield and the five adjacent municipalities. Instituting a maximum annual rate of
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
01-225LIT-2018_ZN_Ord.doc.doc Page 100. Amended March 2018
residential growth as reflected in a sustainable rate of development allows Litchfield to
grow at a rate similar to the adjoining region, while also enabling Litchfield time to plan
for capital facility expansions and provide for orderly development.
2101.00 Applicability and Effect.
This ordinance applies to all lots of record as defined in 2102.00, as well as to all future
residential development. The application of this ordinance to lots of record is for tracking
purposes only. To receive a residential building permit an applicant is required to possess a
building certificate (also referred to herein as a certificate) from the Planning Board for each
approved dwelling unit. It is a prerequisite that in order to receive a certificate an applicant
must supply to the Town Clerk a properly filled-out application for a certificate. This
ordinance does not apply to non-residential building or to the expansion, alternation,
renovation or replacement of existing dwelling units. Beginning on the effective date of this
ordinance, no building permit for a new dwelling unit shall be issued except in accordance
with the issuance of a certificate pursuant to this ordinance.
2102.00 Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply only to the growth management section and shall not be
affected by provisions of any other ordinance of the Town.
2102.01 Building Certificate. A certificate obtained from the Planning Board entitling the holder to
obtain one building permit for one dwelling unit
2102.02 Housing for Older Persons. Housing designed specifically for occupancy by older individuals
in compliance with all applicable local, state and federal requirements.
2102.03 Litchfield Fair Share Region Average Growth Rate (LFSRAGR). Average annual percentage
increase in residential building permits issued in the five adjacent municipalities of Hudson,
Londonderry, Manchester, Merrimack and Nashua for the preceding five-year period
according to building permits issued listings.
2102.04 Lot of Record. Land designated as a separate and distinct parcel prior to the date of posting
(November 17, 1999) of this ordinance either in a legally recorded deed filed with the
Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds or lots submitted as part of a subdivision application
accepted by the Planning Board prior to the date of posting.
2102.05 Sustainable Rate of Development. A target number of building permits to be issued in the
current year equaling the Litchfield Fair Share Region Average Growth Rate Factor
(LFSRAGRF) for the preceding five (5) years times the total number of dwelling units existing
in Litchfield in the preceding year. Round any fraction calculated herein to the next whole
number
2102.06 Total Target Dwelling Units (TDU). The total dwelling units present in the Town of Litchfield
on 31 December. This number includes single-family homes, as well as dwelling units and
duplexes, apartments and other multifamily structures. NOTE: For 1998, the TDU number is

ZONING ORDINANCE
01-225LIT-2018_ZN_Ord.doc.doc Page 101. Amended March 2018
2103.00 Periodic Review.
It shall be the responsibility of the Planning Board to monitor growth in the Town and region
and notify the Town of the findings.
a. (2002) The Planning Board or its agent(s) shall assemble in March such information
necessary for assessing whether unsustainable rates of development continue to exist, and,
if so, to determine the sustainable rate of development. Information should include
statistics on building permits issued, building permits issued and redeemed. Reliable
information that may be used includes: statistics provided by the local Building Inspector
and 'Permit Authorized Construction in Permit-Issuing Places by State and County' as
reported by the Building Permits Branch of the U.S. Census.
b. The Building Inspector shall provide to the Planning Board information describing the
status of requests and issuance of building permits on a semi-annual basis to aid in
monitoring the issuance of certificates and permits. The information provided shall
include: 1) the number of permits issued in each of the last four (4) semi-annual periods.
For reporting purposes, half-year periods conform to the calendar year January 1 - June 30,
and July 1 - December 31. Information for each period shall be submitted within 31 days
of the end of December and June.
2104.00 Calculation of Annual Certificate Pool and Semi-Annual Certificate Allocation
Data shall be collected for the previous six (6) years on the number of new dwelling units for
the five regional towns (see definitions). For the purposes of Section 2104.00 calculations, the
yearly statistics to be utilized are based upon a calendar year of January 1 to December 31. To
calculate the certificate allocation for the current year, steps a, b and c must be completed as
described below:
a. Calculation of the Litchfield Fair Share Region Average Growth Rate Factor.
(See Definitions)
b. Calculate the Sustainable Rate of Development. (See Definitions)
c. Calculate the Current Year Certificates Available for Disbursement in Semi-Annual
Allocations.
1.) Calculate the net available additional current year certificates (discretionary allocation
in 2105.00.e) by subtracting from 2104.00.b the quantity of certificates issued for lots
of record in the prior year and any certificates to be guaranteed allocation in the
current year, as described in Guaranteed Allocation in 2105.00.c, from the gross
available current year certificates calculated above.
(a) If the calculated net available current year certificates is less than or equal to
eight (8) then the number of certificates available through discretionary
allocation for the current year shall be eight (8).
(b) If the calculated net current year certificates are greater than eight (8) then
the number of certificates for the current year available through discretionary
allocation shall be the calculated number.
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
01-225LIT-2018_ZN_Ord.doc.doc Page 102. Amended March 2018
2.) Divide the net current year certificates by two (2) to determine the quantity of
certificates that may be issued each semi-annual period. NOTE: Should this
ordinance be enacted during the course of a year, the Planning Board shall calculate
the semi-annual certificate allocation as described above but shall only issue the
quantity of certificates available for the remaining half-year period(s).
(a) If the calculated certificates available for semi-annual allocation equals a fraction
then distribute the certificates over the year assigning the largest quantity to the
first half-year period such that both half-year periods certificate allocation equals
a whole number.
2105.00 Procedures for Distributing Certificates.
Certificates shall be distributed according to the following allocation rules:
a. One building certificate must be obtained for each dwelling unit. .
b. From January 1 through December 31, the Town Clerk, on a form prepared by the
Planning Board, shall receive applications for certificates for the current year. These
applications shall be time and date stamped when received. The basis for determining the
priority standing among all applications for the semi-annual allotment of certificates shall
be the order of submission of the applications as indicated by the Town Clerk office
stamp. Except for lots of record, no application for certificates may be made prior to
recording with HCRD of an approved subdivision. Lots to be built with a duplex are
required to obtain two building certificates. NOTE: All applications for certificates for a
subdivision shall be placed onto a single form provided by the Planning Board and must
list all lots.
c. Guaranteed Allocation: So that all developments are assured an allocation of certificates
appropriate to the size of their subdivision and investment, all subdivisions approved by
the Planning Board shall receive a guaranteed allocation of certificates beginning with the
next calendar year after subdivision recording with HCRD a minimum certificate
allocation according to the following schedule: all subdivisions shall receive at least one
(1) certificate per year; subdivisions with ten (10) to nineteen (19) lots shall receive at
least two (2) certificates per year; subdivisions with twenty (20) to twenty-nine (29) lots
shall receive at least three (3) certificates per year; subdivisions with thirty (30) to thirtynine
(39) lots shall receive at least four (4) certificates per year; subdivisions with forty
(40) or more lots shall receive five (5) certificates per year. See Section 2105.00(f),
Discretionary Allocation, for procedures by which subdivisions approved under this
ordinance may be granted a discretionary allocation of certificates during the year of their
recording at the HCRD.
d. Subdivisions approved under this ordinance and recorded at HCRD may request allocation
of certificates during the year of their recording.
e. Each subdivision may receive their minimum guaranteed certificate allocation pursuant to
2105.00(c) at any time during the year and are not required to wait until semi-annual
allocations.
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
01-225LIT-2018_ZN_Ord.doc.doc Page 103. Amended March 2018
f. Discretionary Allocations: The remaining certificates shall be allotted semi-annually by
the following system:
1.) Subdivisions approved under this ordinance and recorded at the HCRD may request
discretionary allocation of certificates during the year of their recording.
2.) (2002) During March and September the Planning Board shall conduct its semi-annual
certificate allocations which each respectively cover the six (6) months after the date of
the meetings. (Ex. March for April, May, June, July, August, September, and
September for October, November, December, January, February and March.)
3.) If a surplus of certificates are left over from distribution in the prior half-year period,
the remaining certificates may at the discretion of the Planning Board be added to the
number of permits available in the current period.
4.) When the number of certificate applications exceeds the number of certificates
available, the semi-annual allocation is distributed among applications using a priority
based upon the order in which the Town Clerk received the applications. An applicant
on the waiting list may receive some part of the available certificates based on the size
of their subdivision; subdivisions less than ten (10) units may receive one (1)
certificate; ten (10) to nineteen (19) lot subdivisions may receive two (2) certificates;
twenty (20) to twenty-nine (29) lot subdivisions may receive three (3) certificates; thirty
(30) to thirty-nine (39) lot subdivisions may receive four (4) certificates and forty (40)
or more lot subdivisions may receive five (5) permits. Based on the number of
certificates available, the first applicant on the list receives either: a) the maximum
allocation they are allowed corresponding to the subdivision size, or b) they receive the
total quarterly allocation if this number is less than a. This is repeated by moving down
the waiting list until all available certificates are allocated.
5.) At the next semi-annual allocation, the allocation commences with the next applicant
scheduled to receive a certificate that did not receive any certificates in the prior
allocation.
6.) The owners of lots allocated certificates may formally apply to the Building Inspector

300.00 PROCEDURE
310.00 Preapplication Review (Amended May 19, 2015)
Prior to the submission of a completed application, the applicant is encouraged to come to the
Board for a preapplication review. The preapplication review provides an opportunity for the
applicant and the Board to discuss the concept of the proposal in the context of the Town’s
master plan and regulations. The purpose of the review is to ensure complete knowledge of
applicable rules and regulations, to save time in the preparation of plans, to ensure that an
adequate plan is submitted and to acquaint the board with the intentions of the applicant. All
discussions during the preapplication review phase by both the applicant and the Board are
non-binding. Though the preapplication review phase is optional, the Board strongly
recommends that applicants for major subdivisions participate in this process. There are two
optional phases to preapplication review, conceptual consultation and design review.
310.01 Conceptual Consultation. The applicant may request a meeting with the Board to discuss a
proposal in conceptual form and in general terms. Conceptual consultations must be conducted
at a public meeting of the Board but do not require formal notification of abutters. The
conceptual consultation is informal and will adhere to the following.
a. All requests for conceptual consultations shall be made in writing and received no less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting at which the applicant wishes to appear.
b. The applicant may bring in a site location map or a base map of the site, which provides
minimal detail of the proposal.
c. The board and the applicant may discuss the basic concept of the proposal, review the
proposal with regard to the master plan and the zoning ordinance, explain the applicable
local regulations and provide guidance relative to other state and local requirements.
310.02 Design Review. (Sept. 2001) The applicant may request a design review with the Board or its
designee prior to the submission of a completed application. This phase involves a non-binding
review of specific design and engineering details of the proposal. Formal notification of abutters
and the general public is required for design reviews. Requests for design review will adhere to
the following.
a. All requests for design review must be submitted no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
scheduled meeting of the Board at which the design review will be considered, with the
application form, the appropriate fees and the following information:
1. A list of abutters and their addresses obtained from the Town records not more than
five (5) days before submission and the name and business address of every engineer,
architect land surveyor or soil scientist whose professional seal appears on any plat
submitted to the Board.
2. Six copies of the proposal for initial plan submission, four copies of subsequent plan
revisions, at a horizontal scale of not more than 1 inch equals 100 feet (1"=100') showing:
a) topography for the entire parcel with contours not to exceed five (5) feet;
b) soil boundaries certified by a soil scientist, engineer, the HCCD or the Soil
Conservation Service;
c) the location of wetlands, lakes or ponds and rivers or streams;

all of the information required in Section 500.00 Plat Submission Requirements, Section 700.00
Design Standards, the Subdivision Plan Review Checklist, requests for waivers per Section

procedures.
320.01 Application Filing. (Sept. 2001) A Subdivision Review Application must be completed and filed

Section 500.00 Plat Submission Requirements, the Subdivision Plan Review Checklist, request
for waivers, variances granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment and any additional studies
requested by the Board must accompany the application. Revised plans, letters and other
information and materials submitted to the Board or its agents after the filing deadline of 21-
days shall not be considered in determining the completeness of a subdivision plan for approval
by the Planning Board for that meeting.
320.02 Waivers. (Sept. 2001) The applicant may request in writing that the Board waive any of the
requirements contained in Section 500.00 Plat Submission Requirements, the Subdivision Plan
Review Checklist and any other standards contained in this regulation. Written waivers
requests shall use the Waiver Request Form found in Appendix K and provide the specific
section number, title and a justification, which explains how the waiver will not detract from the
intent of these regulations. Requests for waivers should accompany the application filing and
be discussed with the Board’s designated representative prior to the submission of the
application. The designated representative will advise the Board on the request for a waiver.
The Board shall vote to grant or deny the applicant’s written request for a waiver from a specific
section of these regulations after a determination of application completeness and the decision
shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting and contained in a written response to the
applicant.
320.03 Preliminary Review. All subdivision proposals must be reviewed by the Board’s designated
representative prior to the submission for Planning Board consideration of application
completeness. This process will review if the application and the plats conform to the
requirements of the Town’s land use regulations and ordinances. At this time, the applicant will
be informed of any deficiencies, which will need to be corrected before the proposal can be
placed on the agenda for formal consideration. If the application conforms to the regulations or
needs only minor revisions, the Subdivision Plan Review Application may be submitted to the
Board with the consent of the Board Chairman.
320.04 Public Notice. A public hearing shall be held for all submitted applications prior to the
acceptance and approval of a subdivision. The secretary will notify the applicant and/or his
agent, all abutters and every engineer, architect land surveyor or soil scientist whose
professional seal appears on any plat of the submission of an application and/or the date of the
public hearing on a proposal by certified mail at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. Public
notice shall be posted in two (2) public places and printed in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Town at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. If the notice for the public hearing was
included in the notice of application submission or any prior notice, additional notice of the
public hearing is not required. Notice of an adjourned session of a hearing is not required
provided that the date, time and place of the adjourned session is announced at the prior
meeting.
320.05 Submission and Acceptance. (Sept. 2001) An application shall only be submitted to and
accepted by the Board at a properly noticed public hearing as required by RSA 676:4,I(d).
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
Subdivision Regulations
03-225LIT-2015_SD_Reg Page 7 Amended May 19, 2015
Upon a determination that the application is complete, the Board may vote to accept the
application. Immediately after acceptance of the application, the Board will determine if the
application will have regional impact per RSA 36:54 through 36:58. If the finding of the Board is
that the application is of regional significance, the Board will not commence review of the
application until notice to the regional abutters is officially made.
Once accepted, the applicant may present the proposal to the Board and the general public. The
Board will ask questions and discuss the proposal, and then open the floor to questions and
comments from abutters and the general public. The date of acceptance recorded in the minutes
begins the sixty-five (65) day review period. Should the application not be accepted, the Board
must state the reasons and specify any additional requirements to the applicant at the meeting
and will provide a written response to the applicant listing the reasons for refusal to accept.
Any plan revisions proposed subsequent to acceptance must be filed a minimum of 7 days prior
to the scheduled or continued public hearing.
320.06 Minor Subdivisions / Lot Line Adjustments. (Sept. 2001) Minor subdivisions, including lot-line
adjustments and lot consolidations shall follow the same application and approval procedures
as other subdivisions; however, they may receive expedited review by the Board where deemed
appropriate upon a written request of the applicant. Minor subdivisions which do not create
lots that are further sub-dividable may be accepted and approved in one meeting provided the
application has been properly noticed and the required information has been provided to the
Board to make an informed decision. Applications for lot consolidations must include a
notarized, written statement by the owner that the lots being consolidated are not subject to
separate mortgages or other encumbrances.
320.07 Action on a Completed Application. (Sept. 2001) The Board shall act to approve, conditionally
approve or disapprove a completed application within sixty-five (65) days of its acceptance.
The Board may apply to the Selectmen for an extension of the review period not to exceed
ninety (90) days. In addition, the applicant may waive the requirement for Board action within
the specified time limit and consent to a mutually agreed upon extension.
If the Board has not taken action on a completed application within sixty-five (65) days of its
acceptance and has not obtained an extension, the applicant may obtain an order by submitting
a written request to the Board of Selectmen requesting them to direct the Planning Board to act
on the application within thirty (30) days If the Planning Board fails to act on the order, the
Selectmen shall have forty (40) days to certify that the plat is approved unless noncompliance
with some specific provision of the subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance or other
ordinance is identified in writing. Failure of the Selectmen to issue an order to the Board or act
to certify approval of the plat shall constitute grounds for the applicant to petition the superior
court as provided in RSA 676:4,I(c)(2).
320.08 Approval. Approval of the subdivision plat shall be by affirmative vote of the majority of the
Board present at the meeting. The plat is certified by the signatures of the Board Chairman and
Vice-chairman and the date of approval on the plat. The Board will transmit the signed and
dated Mylar copy of the plat to the Hillsborough County Register of Deeds along with the
recording fees paid by the applicant. The approved plat will not be recorded until all fees have
been paid by the applicant. The applicant may not commence construction of the subdivision
until the plat is recorded.
320.09 Conditional Approval. (Sept. 2001) The Board may grant conditional approval of an application
if the remaining actions on the application: are administrative in nature; involve the applicant’s

codes, state and federal laws or regulations. Consistent with NH RSA 676:4,I(i)(3), the planning
board may conditionally approve a plat or application, subject to the applicant obtaining all
applicable local, state and/or federal permits. (Amended May 19, 2015)
403.00 Site Analysis.
The applicant will conduct a site analysis to assess the positive and negative development
characteristics of the site. The analysis will include, but not be limited to, the following: soils;
topography; existing vegetation; threatened and endangered species; wetlands and surface
waters; drainage patterns; groundwater resources; existing structures and road networks;
existing and future easements; open space and visual features; historic features; impact on
public services and facilities such as water, schools, fire and police; and surrounding land uses.
The layout of the subdivision will be based on the site analysis. To the maximum extent
possible, development will be located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid
environmentally sensitive areas and to minimize negative impacts.
403.01 Soils:
The purpose of this section is to assure that the land indicated on plats submitted to the
Planning Board is of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to
public health. The subdivision or site plan shall provide soil maps and information in
accordance with the Site Specific Soil Maps for New Hampshire and Vermont, SSSNNE Special
Publication No. 3, June 1997, as updated and amended. The maps shall be prepared and
stamped by a certified soil scientist. All costs of preparing the soil data shall be borne by the
applicant. (March 2000)
404.00 Land Characteristics.
Land of such character that it cannot, in the judgment of the Board, be safely used for building
development purposes because of exceptional danger to health or peril from fire, flood, poor
drainage or other hazardous conditions, shall not be platted for residential, commercial or
industrial subdivision, nor for such other uses as may increase the danger to life or property, or
aggravate the flood hazard. Land with inadequate characteristics or capacity for subsurface
sewage disposal shall not be subdivided for residential, commercial or industrial purposes
unless connected to a municipal sewer.
405.00 Special Flood Hazard Areas.

c. The Planning Board shall require the applicant to submit sufficient evidence (construction
drawings, grading and land treatment plans) so as to allow a determination that:
1. all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
2. all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, are
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and,
3. adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
406.00 Scattered and Premature Subdivision.
The Board shall provide against any scattered or premature subdivision of land which would be
injurious to public health, safety or prosperity because of inadequate water supply, drainage,
transportation, schools, fire protection or other public services, or would necessitate the
excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.
407.00 Fire Protection.
(Sept. 2001) Adequate fire protection shall be provided for all major subdivisions. All fire
protection systems shall be designed in accordance with the standards contained in NFPA 1231,
“Water Supplies for Suburban and Rural Firefighting.” The Litchfield Fire Department shall
review and approve the proposed fire protection method prior to Planning Board approval of
the subdivision.
In order to protect the general health, safety and welfare of the Town’s residents and to promote
the use of hydrants for fire protection, it is the general administrative policy of the Board to
require subdivisions to connect to the public water system and install hydrants when a
connection to the water system is available within a reasonable distance of the proposed
subdivision. In instances where a connection to the public water system is not feasible at the
time of subdivision approval, the Planning Board in conjunction with the Fire Chief or his
designee shall determine an acceptable and appropriate method of fire protection. No building
shall be located more than 500 feet from a fire protection water source which complies with the
NFPA standards. Measurement is taken along a public or private right-of-way.
408.00 Additional Studies.
The Board may require the applicant to conduct and submit additional studies needed to assist
the Board in making an educated and informed decision on the proposal including, but not
limited to, traffic, fiscal impact, recreation, public service and environmental impact analyses.
409.00 Visual Quality.
In examining and passing upon a proposed subdivision, the Board may make recommendations
to the applicant relating to earth movement and retention of natural cover in order to preserve
the natural, visual quality of Litchfield and its environs. Due regard shall be shown for all
natural features, such as large trees, water courses, stone walls, scenic points, historic spots and
similar community assets which if preserved will add attractiveness and value to the
subdivision.
410.00 Parks and Open Space
If there is a specific need created by a proposed subdivision, the Board may require the
provision of recreation or open space land to meet the needs of the development. Areas set
aside for recreation or open space must be of reasonable size and character to suit the proposed
use. No more than 25 percent of any recreation land dedicated to public use shall be wetland
unless specified on the plan and approved by the Board.

Control ), and include temporary and permanent control measures. The Board may waive this
requirement upon the request of the applicant provided all local ordinances; state and federal
statutes are satisfied. The Board may require an evaluation of the potential erosion and
sedimentation impacts of the proposed development by the HCCD, the consulting engineer or
other consultant selected by the Board prior to granting a waiver. (Amended May 2003)

800.00 PRECONSTRUCTION MEETINGS.
A preconstruction meeting will be required by the Planning Board for all major subdivisions
with roadways or drainage. The preconstruction meeting shall be held prior to the
commencement of any activity on the site. The purpose of the preconstruction meeting(s) is to
ensure that all parties involved with the development of the project are familiar with the
approved design, terms and conditions, and to ensure all performance guarantees are adequate
and in place. Representatives from the Planning Board and the Board of Selectmen shall be
notified a minimum of fifteen (15) days prior to a scheduled meeting and may designate a
representative to attend these meetings. Attendees shall include, but are not limited to, the
owner and/or the developer, the contractors and builders, the Planning Board’s designated
representative (consulting engineer), and as required, the Code Enforcement Officer, and the
road agent or their designated representatives.
The owner and/or the developer shall be responsible for the expense and personnel required
for recording and distribution of pre-construction meeting minutes to attendees and the Town
Clerk in accordance with RSA 91-A:2 and 91-A:4. (Amended July 20, 2004)
850.00 POST APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
(Adopted August 1, 2006)
Post approval procedures provide a way to ensure compliance with the subdivision plan and any
conditions of approval. They also ensure that necessary funds to guarantee project completion are
provided.
850.1 Final Plat.
850.1.1 Recording. Upon a vote by the majority of the Planning Board to approve a subdivision plan,
the application shall be deemed to have final approval and the subdivision plan shall be
signed by the Chairperson of the Board and shall be filed with the Planning Board secretary
and/or the Code Enforcement Officer. Any plan not so filed within thirty (30) days of the
date upon which such plan is approved and signed by the Board shall become null and void.
In addition, the signed plan shall be recorded in the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds
(HCRD) within sixty (60) days of the vote to approve the plan. Plans are not valid until
recorded at the registry of deeds. The Planning Board, by vote, may extend the filing period
for good cause.
Approved plans should be signed by the Chair of the Planning Board and filed with the registry of
deeds within 60 days of approval or the plan will expire. Extensions may be granted to deadlines.
850.1.2 Incorporation of Approved Plan. One copy of the approved subdivision plan shall be
provided prior to the initial (first) building permit for the project and all construction
activities shall conform to the approved plan, including any conditions of approval and
minor changes approved by the Planning Board or Town Engineer/Inspector/Code
Enforcement Officer to address field conditions.
A copy of an approved plan shall be provided prior to the initial (first) building permit application
so that the Building Inspector is aware of the Planning Board’s approval. All construction must
comply with the approved plan, including any conditions.
850.2 Conditions of Approval. All terms of a conditional approval shall be met as determined by
the Planning Board in its affirmative vote on the motion for conditional approval, prior to
recording of the plan at the HCRD. All other requirements, bonds and/or guarantee shall be

in place prior to construction beginning. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued prior
to all required improvements necessary to support the dwelling(s) has been completed as
required by the regulations and approved plan (E.g. road base-course, signage, guardrails,
stormwater drainage, utilities, fire protection, etc.). .
All conditions of approval must be met prior to recording plans. All bonds or other requirements
should be met prior to recording plans.
850.3 As-Built Plans Required. Any project involving the construction of public or private roads,
common driveways, or any Stormwater Management construction, including required
driveway culverts, shall provide the Planning Board or Town Engineer and/or Code
Enforcement Officer with a set of construction plans showing the building(s) and site
improvements as actually constructed on the site. These "as-built" plans shall be submitted
within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the project or
upon completion of applicable improvements, whichever comes first. A copy of this plan
shall also be provided the Planning Board for their records.
As-Built plans are required for any plan with public or private roads, common driveways, or
which stormwater management devices will be constructed.
850.4 Inspections and Site Visits. Prior to approval, site visits may be required by the planning
board to better understand the features of the land and the relationship and effect of the
proposed development on the land and the abutters. Proposed centerline to roads and/or
access-ways, test-pits, existing lot lines or other markings typical in the engineering process
may be required prior to a site walk to aid the Board.
Pre-approval site inspections may be required by the Planning Board to best determine the land
characteristics before engineering plans are detailed. Road centerlines, wetlands, existing bounds
and test pit locations should be marked.
A Technical Review Fee for engineering inspections for approved subdivision plans shall
commence the establishment of an escrow account or other account for expenses for plan
review and inspections incurred by the Planning Board, in accordance with RSA 674:44 V
and RSA 676:4 I (g), shall be borne by the applicant. This includes, but is not limited to,
review by consulting engineers or other consultants to assess the environmental impact,
hydrological impact, ground water quality impact, traffic impact, or any other study deemed
necessary by the Planning Board in order to make an informed decision.
Inspections include verification of overall compliance with the approved subdivision plan. In
the case of inspections, funds are due prior to commencing site work or construction and not
at the time of application. Funds from the account will be disbursed on a monthly basis upon
satisfactory completion of service. Inspection reports shall be provided to the Board for their
records. At any time the funds in this account are depleted to $1,500.00 (one thousand five
hundred), and prior to commencement of any new inspections, the account shall be
replenished by the applicant to the full amount required in the Fee Schedule, as established
by the Planning Board or Board of Selectmen.
The use of escrow accounts for engineering inspections is cumbersome on part time staff in
smaller towns. Cash or other means of secure payment may be approved for short duration
projects.
Upon written request by the applicant, any remaining funds in excess of $5.00 (five) shall be
returned to the applicant, provided the municipality receives documentation from the

engineer/inspector that the project has been completed according to the approved plans and
to the satisfaction of the project inspector. The building inspector shall not issue a Certificate
of occupancy until all required improvements necessary to support the dwelling(s) has been
completed as required by the regulations and approved plan (E.g. road base-course, signage,
guardrails, stormwater drainage, utilities, fire protection, etc.). Final performance guarantees
shall not be released until all required improvements are constructed as shown on the
approved subdivision plan and any final inspections or approvals completed.
If permission to inspect is denied by the landowner, the designated agent shall secure an
administrative inspection warrant from the district or Superior Court under RSA 595-B,
Administrative Inspection Warrants.
Money to cover inspections and reviews should be placed in escrow prior to the inspections in
order to ensure that the community is not stuck with the bill. Payment for inspections or reviews
should be disbursed monthly to the inspector in accordance with the fee schedule.
A Certificate of Occupancy, allowing the occupation of the building for its stated purpose will not
be issued unless the improvements necessary to support the dwelling(s) is completed in accordance
with the approved plans.
850.5 Performance Guarantees.
850.5.1 Application. The Planning Board may require the posting of an improvement guarantee in
such amount and form as specified in Performance Guaranty/Bonding Requirements and
Procedures as found in Appendix A of the Town of Litchfield’s regulations, as is reasonably
necessary to ensure the proper installation of all on and off-site improvements required as
conditions of approval. The nature and duration of the guarantee shall be structured to
achieve this goal without adding unnecessary costs to the applicant.
Upon substantial completion of all required improvements, the developer shall notify the
Planning Board, in writing, of the completion or substantial completion of improvements,
and shall send a copy of such notice to the appropriate municipal officials. The respective
municipal officials shall inspect all improvements and shall file a report indicating approval,
partial approval, or rejection of such improvements with a statement of reasons for any
rejection.
The Planning Board shall approve, partially approve, or reject the improvements on the basis
of the report of the municipal officials. If the improvements are approved, the guarantee
shall be released. Where partial approval is granted, the developer shall be released from
liability only for that portion of the improvements approved.
a. Form of Guarantee. Performance guarantees may be provided by a variety of means, as
detailed in Appendix A, that shall be approved as to form and enforceability by the
Planning Board and Municipal Attorney.
Reasonable secured funds may be required to ensure completion of all required on and off-site
improvements. This section prevents the community from having to complete the improvements if
the developer fails to do so.
The security will be released once an inspection confirms they are completed as required. A
reduction in the guarantee will be granted for partially approved improvements. For example, the
developer may construct part of a roadway to access a certain phase of the development. Once
completed, the security for this section of roadway can be released.

850.6 Minor Changes to Approved Plans. Minor changes in approved plans necessary to address
field conditions may be approved by the Planning Board or Town Engineer/Inspector/Code
Enforcement Officer provided that any such change does not affect compliance with the
standards or alter the essential nature of the proposal. The Planning Board or Town
Engineer/ Inspector/Code Enforcement Officer shall endorse any such change in writing on
the approved plan.
850.7 Major Changes to Approved Plans. Approvals of subdivision plans are dependent upon and
limited to the proposals and plans contained in the application and supporting documents
submitted and affirmed to by the applicant. Any variation from the plans, proposals, and
supporting documents, except for minor changes that do not affect approval standards, are
subject to review and approval in a formal public hearing after proper abutter notification.
Engineering and studies applicable to the new subdivision plan may be resubmitted in order
to reduce cost to the applicant, at the Boards discretion.
850.8 Expiration of Approved Plans (Vesting). In accordance with RSA 674:39, Five Year Exemption,
subdivision plan approvals shall become vested from subsequent changes to zoning
ordinances and regulations for a period of five (5) years, provided “active and substantial
development and building” as defined by the Planning Board, has occurred within twentyfour
(24) months of the date of final approval, the exception being those ordinances and
regulations which expressly protect public health standards. If “active and substantial
development and building” has not been achieved within twenty-four (24) months, the plan
shall not be vested and is subject to changes in zoning and regulations. If site development
and/or construction do not achieve “substantial completion” within five (5) years from the
date of subdivision plan approval, the approved plan may be subject to revocation pursuant
to RSA 676:4-a. Once “substantial completion” of the improvements shown on the
subdivision plat has occurred in compliance with the terms of approval the plan shall be
vested from any subsequent changes to the Zoning Ordinance and/or Site Plan Review, and
Subdivision Regulations, except impact fees. If the plan does not achieve substantial
completion within five (5) years, the applicant may reapply for subdivision plan approval.
The applicant may request an extension of the approval deadline prior to the expiration of
the period. Such request shall be in writing and shall be made to the Planning Board. The
Planning Board may grant up to two (2), six (6) month extensions to the periods if the
approved plan conforms to the ordinances and regulations in effect at the time the extension
is granted and any and all federal and state approvals and permits are current. (Amended

revoked by the planning board in whole or in part except as detailed in the statute. Failure to
conform to the statements, plans or specifications upon which an approval was based; failure
to provide adequate security; failure to meet conditions of approval within the time period
set forth in the approval, or if no time period was set, then the time periods specified in RSA
674:39, Four Year Exemption, are grounds for revocation under RSA 676:4-a.

when determining the need for and scope of a traffic impact study. Note: (As of June 2009,
State roadways include NH 3A and NH 102. State maintained roadways include Hillcrest
Road.) Additional representatives may be invited in the case of a Regional Impact
determination.
Unless waived in whole or in part by the Planning Board, the following traffic impact study
and internal traffic circulation plan is required for all site plans.
a. Traffic Impact Study – for ALL roadways in the Town of Litchfield may include, but not be
limited to, any or all of the following:
1. The requirements detailed in the NHDOT document, “Declaratory Ruling No. 2000-01
Driveway Permits; Policy Relating to Driveways and Access to State Highway
Systems,” section 6 (h), as amended.

5. Internal directional signs may be required to direct traffic flow through the site.
c. Integration with adjacent uses: Where a proposed non-residential use abuts existing or
proposed non-residential uses, or a proposed residential use abuts an existing or proposed
residential use, provisions shall be made for vehicular and pedestrian circulation between like
uses. Provisions for joint access or future joint access drives with adjacent like uses are
encouraged. (Amended March 2016)
120.1.2 Street Impact
The applicant is responsible for assessing the impact of the proposed development on street
systems, and shall be responsible for any design, permitting and construction. If a
development will generate enough traffic to significantly impact the level of service of an offsite
roadway or intersection, then the developer shall be responsible for upgrading the facility
to accommodate the new development. If the Planning Board requires such actions, the
applicant shall be responsible only for the degree of improvement necessary to mitigate the
impact of the proposed development.
120.1.3 Performance.
The internal network of streets and driveways shall be designed to accommodate
demonstrated traffic demand, be safe, efficient, have a simple and logical pattern, respect
natural features and topography; and present an attractive streetscape.
120.1.4 General Street and Driveway Design
Roadway and driveway access point shall be designed utilizing current “smart growth”
techniques for context sensitive design (See Definitions), and as otherwise required in
Litchfield by applicable State and Town regulations. At such time as the Town may adopt a
Roadway Master Plan, the requirements outline therein shall also apply.
Streets shall not be over-designed for their use. For example,
streets that serve only a multi-family residential use need not
be as wide as a major arterial roadway. Overly wide
pavement widths encourage faster moving traffic and increase
the amount of impervious surface. Context Sensitive Design
techniques shall be utilized wherever possible.
a. Street Classification. The size and design needs of new streets
shall be based upon the projected number of vehicles they are to carry. All streets shall be
classified in the site plan review process according to the functional street classification defined
by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) “Green
Book,” A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, as amended.
b. Design and Dedication Standards. Private streets and streets intended for public dedication shall
satisfy the Street Standards found in this section, Public & Private Road Design Requirements
found in Appendix A, Construction Standards found in Appendix B, and Inspection and
Acceptance of Streets found in Appendix C. For State highways, standards, specifications and
procedures of NH Department of Transportation (NHDOT) shall apply. Driveways on Town
and private roads that require site plan review shall satisfy the Driveway Standards found in
LITCHFIELD LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Site Plan Review Regulations
04-225LIT-2017_SP_Reg.doc.doc Page 22. Amended December 5, 2017
this section. For driveways on State or State maintained roads and highways that require site
plan review, the minimum standards, specifications and procedures of NHDOT apply. (E.g.
“Declaratory Ruling No. 2000-01 Driveway Permits; Policy Relating to Driveways and Access to
State Highway Systems,” including Appendix II, Figures I - XV (English Unit Measurements), as
amended.) Additional requirements under the State Building and Fire Code shall be
required, where applicable. Where street design criteria are not provided, then streets shall
be designed in accordance with the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) “Green Book,” A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways
and Streets, as amended. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards shall apply where
applicable (E.g. sidewalks, ingress and egress points, parking and crosswalks, etc.)The Fire
Chief, Road Agent and Planning Board/Consulting Engineer and/or Town Engineer shall
review the design of all streets and driveways prior to final approval by the Planning Board.
c. Travel Lanes. All streets and driveways shall only have turn lanes, deceleration lanes or more
than one travel lane in each direction if it can be demonstrated, through a traffic model or study
conducted by a qualified NH licensed Engineer, that more than temporary congestion is
anticipated. Where a total of four or more lanes are planned, planted medians shall be utilized
to reduce the visual impact of pavement.
d. Conservation of Scenic Features. The proposed network of streets and driveways shall conserve
scenic features, including but not limited to mature trees, stone walls and riparian vegetation.
e. Multi-Modal Transportation. The proposed network of streets and driveways shall provide for
the smooth, safe, convenient and functional movement of all modes of transportation, including
vehicles, public transit, bikes and pedestrians. Priority shall be given to pedestrian circulation.
Conflicts between pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles shall be minimized. Separation of systems
shall be created through design elements such as changes in grade, materials, screens and
structures.
f. Construction Requirements. All streets and driveways shall be built according to the approved
site plan, as determined by the Planning Board/Consulting Engineer, prior to the issuance of a
building permit for any portion of the development. Pavement shall consist of two courses. A
2-inch base course and a 1-inch wearing course. The wearing course shall not be applied until
two (2) years after the base course, 80 percent of the occupancy permits have been issued, and
the road has been duly inspected for deficiencies. No paving of streets and roads shall take
place during the period from November 15 to April 1. In the event of suitable weather within
this period, any paving shall only be conducted with the prior approval of the Litchfield Road
Agent and the consulting engineer. (Amended July 9, 2013)
120.1.5 Number, Spacing and Width of Access Points
Driveways and access points requiring site plan approval on Town or private roads shall satisfy
the Driveway Standards found in this section. For driveways on State or State maintained roads,
the minimum standards, specifications and procedures of NHDOT apply. See section 120.1.4
“General Street and Driveway Design” above.
Section 120.1.5 is based on the principals of Access Management “…which involves providing or
managing access to land development while simultaneously preserving the flow of traffic on the
surrounding road system in terms of safety, capacity and speed.”(Source, AASHTO).

Subdivisions and RSA 236:13, Driveways and Other Accesses to Public Ways, and RSA 236:14,
Penalty, as amended.
b. General Provisions. A NHDOT DRIVEWAY PERMIT is required for ALL curb cuts intended
to take access from a current or future State or State maintained roadway. Curb cuts
intended to take access from current or future Town or Private Roadways require local
approval from the Planning Board and Road Agent during site plan review. This includes
alteration or relocation of an existing driveway. NOTE: See Appendix J, Residential
Driveway Regulations & Permit for a copy of the Town RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAY PERMIT
APPLICATION for residential curb cuts, driveway, and driveway apron design
requirements. This includes temporary access points (E.g. Access for logging, construction
entrances).
All curb cuts on State of New Hampshire highways or state-maintained portions of roadways
in Litchfield are reviewed through the office of the District 5 Engineer of NHDOT who is
responsible for issuance of permits. Contact NHDOT for current requirements.
No landowner or authorized agent may construct, or alter in any way that substantially
affects the size, grade, or function of, any drainage structure or feature, driveway, entrance,
exit, or approach within the limits of the right-of-way of any class of roadway in the Town of
Litchfield without prior approval.
The provisions in this section are based on principals of access management.
c. Driveway Approach Width (commercial and industrial): The maximum width of a driveway
approach for a two-way driveway shall not exceed fifty (50) feet. The minimum width of a
driveway approach for two-way driveway shall not be less than thirty (30) feet. These widths
may include two (2) foot shoulders.
d. Driveway Approach Width (multifamily residential): The maximum width of a driveway
approach shall not exceed twenty four (24) feet. The minimum width of a driveway
approach shall not be less than twelve (12) feet.
e. Driveway Access Spacing: Driveway access spacing shall be measured from the edge of the
proposed driveway pavement to the nearest edge of the roadway of the adjacent or opposite

driveway or street. Where possible shared driveways are encouraged and may be required.
(Amended December 2013)
1. Driveway access spacing shall meet the requirements of Table 120.1-1. See Diagram
120.1-1. Minimum spacing may be waived where access is otherwise not possible, sideby-
side driveways are approved to reduce curb cuts and as necessary for reduced
frontage lots. (Amended December 2013, March 2016)

All Other Roads or lots with access provided from a road
other than Route 102 or 3A 75 150
2. Parking lots for single tenant commercial developments shall utilize shared driveways
where possible to meet the minimum spacing and shall contact adjacent property owners
to obtain access easements as needed. At the time of site plan approval, each
development may be required to extend the easement to the next property. The Planning
Board may waive this requirement if it determines that it is physically impossible to
provide shared access to the lot or if extenuating circumstances can be demonstrated and
are approved by the by the Planning Board. (Amended December 2013)
3. Wherever a proposed development abuts undeveloped land or a future development
phase of the same development, stubs-out shall be installed in order to provide access to
abutting properties or to logically extend the street system into the surrounding area. All
street stubs shall be provided with temporary turn-arounds or cul-de-sacs. The
restoration and extension of the street shall be the responsibility of any future developer
of the abutting land. These standards may be waived by the Planning Board where
specific finding is made that the peculiar nature of the property results in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships that impede carrying out the strict letter of the
requirement. (Amended December 2013)
4. Multi-tenant non-residential developments and multi-family residential shall provide a
central drive entrance. Each development shall provide an "entrance throat" that will
direct traffic and provide for stacking space at intersections with the corridor. This
limited access will permit the Town and State to control traffic at this location. The
development shall extend access to adjacent properties in order to control access to the
corridor. (Amended December 2013, March 2016)

Diagram 120.1-1: Driveway Access Spacing
Section 120.1.5, (d), establishes a minimum distance between access points. By doing this, the
number of access points a driver has to observe, and therefore the number of conflict points, are
reduced.
f. Intersection Alignment. If a proposed driveway cannot meet the requirements of Section
120.1.5, (d), (or Diagram 120.1-1), then the proposed driveway shall be aligned directly
opposite an existing or proposed opposite driveway and the configuration shall be treated as
a four-way intersection.
g. Angle of Driveway Approach. The angle of non-residential driveway approach shall be
approximately ninety (90) degrees for two-way driveways and between sixty (60) degrees
and ninety (90) degrees for one-way non-residential driveways.
h. Turning Radii. The principal users of the roadway shall be considered when determining the
inside turning radii. The inside turning radii shall vary between a minimum of fifteen (15)
feet and a maximum of thirty (30) feet and meet the minimum and maximum requirements of
Table 120.1-2. See Diagram 120.1-2.

The size of the turning radius affects the speed at which vehicles can exit the flow of
traffic and enter a driveway. The larger the turning radius, the greater the speed of
entry. The turning radius shall be based on land use. In areas of high pedestrian traffic
or in a residential development, the turning radii should be smaller. In commercial areas
with heavy truck traffic, the turning radius will need to be larger

i. Corner Clearance. No driveway approach may be located closer to the corner than indicated in
Table 120.1-3 and Diagram 120.1-3. The measurement shall be taken from the intersection of
property lines at the corner to the nearest edge of the proposed driveway pavement. When
these requirements cannot be met due to lack of frontage, the nearest edge of the proposed
driveway pavement shall be located as far as possible from the intersection of property lines
at the corner.
Similar to the driveway spacing requirements, driveways should be located an adequate distance
from intersections so as to avoid turning vehicle conflicts

j. Driveway Throat Length. Driveway throat length shall be measured from the edge of the
property line to the furthest end of the driveway. A minimum driveway throat length of
twenty-five (25) feet for collector streets, forty (40) feet for minor arterials, and fifty-five (55)
feet for major arterials shall be required. The purpose of the driveway throat length is to
allow for traffic entering the site to be stored on site in order to avoid a queue of traffic on the
roadway causing delays and a potentially hazardous situation. See Diagram 120.1-4

k. Shared Access. Shared driveways are encouraged and may be required between adjacent lots
that front on arterial and collector streets. In such cases, a joint access easement between the
property owners may be required. The location and dimensions of said easement shall be
determined by the Planning Board. Provisions for joint access or future joint access driveways
with adjacent like uses may be substituted for buffer yards as required under Section 160. See
Diagram 120.1-5. (Amended March 2016)
Throat length is the length of the driveway that is controlled
internally from turning traffic, measured from the intersection
with the road. Driveways should be designed with adequate
throat length to accommodate queuing of the maximum number of
vehicles as defined by the peak period of operation of the
development. Providing an adequate throat length works in
concert with locating the principal structure closer to the roadway
and placing the parking at the rear or side. The photo to the right
is an example of adequate throat length.
Diagram 120.1–5, shows how the parking lots of the various structures along an arterial roadway
are connected and access taken from side roads. This allows traffic to move between the various
structures without entering the arterial roadway.

120.1.8 Drive-Through Facilities.
Any non-residential use that provides drive-through service shall be located and designed to
minimize the impact on neighboring properties and traffic circulation. Drive-through facilities
shall not be located in any buffer or setback to an adjacent residential use or zone. Vehicular
access to the drive-through shall be through a separate lane that prevents vehicle queuing within
normal parking areas. Adequate queuing space shall be provided to prevent any vehicles from
having to wait on a public street, within the entry from the street, or within designated parking
areas. The drive-through shall not interfere with any sidewalk or bicycle circulation. See
Diagram 120.1-7. (Amended March 2016)

a. Pedestrian Traffic (Multi-Family Residential): The use of interconnecting walkways, trails and
natural walking paths shall be an integral part of the design of any development to facilitate
access between common areas, groups of dwelling units and open space areas. Easements
shall be requested where trails or potential trails on abutting lands may allow for a local
connection. Appropriate timing and restrictions may apply. Primary walkways and
sidewalks shall meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. Secondary trails
and natural walking paths are exempt from strictly meeting this requirement, but the Board
encourages maximizing accessibility to residents. (Amended March 2004, March 2016)
120.3 EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS
Provisions shall be made for emergency vehicle access to and throughout the site. The Fire Chief
and Police Chief shall review all site plans to determine the adequacy of provisions for emergency
vehicle access. A clearly defined fire lane, not less than ten (10) feet in width, shall be located around
and adjacent to all principal and accessory structures intended for human occupation.
120.4 DRAINAGE

required for water intended for human consumption. For purposes of measuring the adequacy of
water volumes in fire ponds or cisterns, the bottom foot and top two feet may not be included in the
total volume of water available for fire safety.
120.6 SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
The applicant shall demonstrate the adequacy of the Town's existing solid waste disposal facility to
service the projected solid waste volumes and waste composition that is anticipated to be generated
at the site. In addition, the applicant shall demonstrate consistency with the following:
a. All operations serviced by a municipal sewer system shall be subject to the Litchfield
Industrial/Commercial Pre-treatment program to insure compliance with federal, state, and
local regulations prior to disposal in a municipal sewer system.
b. Operations utilizing subsurface waste water disposal systems shall not use, produce, store, or
dispose of any contaminant or substance of a type or in such quantities which may adversely
impact surface or groundwater resources so as to impair its use for human consumption,
recreation and public enjoyment, or wildlife habitats.
c. No waste material or refuse shall be disposed of or allowed to remain on-site except within an
enclosed building or stationary containment system. No solid wastes shall be dumped or
allowed to remain in such a way as to allow wastes to fly or be scattered due to wind or

or impact statement to determine compliance with any and or all of the environmental factors cited
above.
120.8 LANDSCAPING
A landscape design shall be included as part of the site plan to include proposed grading, existing
and proposed vegetation by species, size and location; paving materials. Cross sections and details
may be required. Indigenous vegetation, prominent natural features and waterbodies should be
retained and used to enhance the site design where possible.
Multi-Family Developments shall provide plans consistent with the Landscaping, Off Street
Parking and Loading requirements in these Site Plan Review Regulations. Due to the clustering
of dwellings, privacy screening (screen unobstructed interior views) is encouraged and will be
required when the orientation of adjacent dwellings prevents screening consistent with the overall
level found throughout the development. The landscape design shall provide for front and back
yards consistent with typical single family development in Litchfield. (Amended March 2004,
March 2016)
Where landscaping is proposed to screen unsightly features, the minimum requirements shall
include the planting of one evergreen tree or shrub per 10 linear feet of required screen length or
perimeter. The height of required trees or shrubs shall be equal to 1/2 of the maximum height of the
item requiring the screen at the time of planting. Required plantings shall be regularly spaced so as
to maximize the overall density of the landscape screen. (Amended December 2013)

120.12 PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF WETLANDS
(as defined in Section 600 of the Zoning Ordinance,) aquifers, streams, rivers, and other aquatic
bodies and tributaries. Conservation easements and/or vegetated buffers of not less than fifty feet
measured from the edge of wetlands, perennial streams or open bodies of water to any developed
portion of the site, may be required.
120.13 BUILDING ORIENTATION AND DESIGN STANDARDS.1 (ADOPTED MAY 18, 2005)
120.13.1 General Procedures
Site plans shall portray the design of all buildings and the relationship of the development to
surrounding properties, buildings, natural features and built features. All site plans shall
adhere to the specifications and guidelines set forth in Section 120.13 of these regulations. The
Planning Board may require that developments proposed in areas of special sensitivity or
significance be designed by a professional Land Planner or Architect.
120.13.2 Natural Features
Buildings, lots, impervious surfaces and accessory structures shall be sited in those portions of
the site that have the most suitable conditions for development. Environmentally sensitive
areas, including but not limited to, wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, significant wildlife
habitats, fisheries, scenic areas, habitat for rare and endangered plants and animals, unique
natural communities and natural areas, and sand and gravel aquifers, shall be maintained and
preserved to the maximum extent. Natural drainage areas shall be preserved to the maximum
extent. The development shall include appropriate measures for protecting these resources,
including but not limited to, modification of the proposed design of the site, timing of
construction, and limiting the extent of excavation.
120.13.3 Building Orientation
Building facades shall be oriented parallel to the street and maintain a consistent street edge in
relationship to adjacent structures. Buildings shall be sited so that buildings create pedestrian
plazas (non-residential) and gathering places (all development types). Buildings shall be sited
so that entrances are clearly identifiable and directly accessible from a sidewalk. Buildings
shall be accessible for pedestrians, bicyclists and future public transit users. See Diagram
120.13.3. (Amended March 2016)
Most site plan regulations do not address building orientation and design. In addition to other
standards, the control of building orientation and design is important if the community wishes to
preserve its local character. Many communities are now requesting elevation drawings for new
developments, as required in section 120.13.10.
1 For more information on community design, please see Nashua Regional Planning Commission, Non-Residential Community
Character Guidelines, 2000.
Retail centers are typically designed like
this:

Building orientation and design standards encourage
a more aesthetically pleasing, functional and higher
quality design, like this:

.
Multi-Family Residential similarly can create a more aesthetically pleasing, functional and higher
quality design through aligning front facades to the street, incorporating front walkways and porches:
(Amended March 2016)
Diagram 120.13.3 Building facades parallel to street with consistent street edge
Buildings that are parallel to the street and set back consistent with other structures on the street
are generally thought to create a more defined sense of place. However, the location of buildings in
relationship to the street and other structures will vary from
one community to the next.
Large buildings with extreme horizontal massing can seem
out of place with surrounding developments. Building
height should be similar to adjacent development. In
addition, the mass of large buildings can be tempered with
design treatments, as in the image to the right:
120.13.4 Building Heights
The applicant shall ensure that building heights are compatible with and transition from the
height of adjacent development. The building height and number of floors shall comply with
the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance. See Diagram 120.13.4.

j. Use of complementary and cohesive, yet varied, colors and materials to distinguish
individual multi-family units or structures from one another.
k. Use of traditional large single family home design character such as “big house, little house,
back house, barn” that is adaptable to multi-family homes.
(Amended March 2016)
Blank walls should be avoided. Windows should reflect
“human scale.” That is, reflect the approximate height to
width ratio of a human being.
120.13.6 Roof Forms and Materials
Rooflines shall not run in continuous planes of more than fifty (50) feet. Flat roofs are
discouraged. All roofs shall provide adequate overhangs for pedestrian activity. Roof
materials shall be composed of high quality, durable and architecturally consistent materials,

treatments. Providing options allows for flexibility in design while not permitting blank facades. The
buildings below include several features each:
Overhang, projection, and arches with
details integrated to the building
Sidelights, portico, front porch, planters
120.13.9 Building Screening
All rooftop air conditioning, heating equipment and other large mechanical equipment shall be
screened from public view. The screening may be part of the articulation of the building.
120.13.10 Building Design Review
All existing buildings within 200 feet of the boundaries of the parcel shall be delineated in plan
and elevation. Elevational drawings of all sides of proposed principal structures shall be
provided to indicate building scale and massing, location of windows and doors, building
materials, general style, and compatibility with surrounding buildings and land uses. An
axonometric and/or perspective drawing or artists rendering of the proposed site shall be
provided from the vantagepoint that will most commonly be seen outside of the boundaries of
the parcel. Such rendering shall depict the site as it is likely to appear upon opening including
automobiles, pedestrians, trucks, loading areas, and any features indicated in plan that would
be visible from the selected vantage point.
Housing for Older Persons developments shall conform to these regulations with emphasis on
the vantagepoint seen from adjacent properties to ensure appropriate scale and arrangement in
light of the underlying zoning district, the prominence of the site, viewsheds, adjacent uses and
the surrounding neighborhood. (Amended March 2004)
120.14 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
Adequacy of the off street parking and loading: Parking areas shall be located to the rear or side
of proposed principal structures and may not be located within fifty feet of any public
right-of-way or within side or rear yard setbacks. Corner lots or dual frontage lots may contain
parking areas between buildings or structures on a site and a public right-of-way if the Planning
Board determines that suitable alternative locations for required parking spaces cannot be
provided on the site. Parking areas shall be screened from adjacent parcels and public
rights-of-way, and shall be landscaped according to the following specifications:
1. Greenspace: Interior landscaping or greenspace, encompassing not less than 5% of the total

140 SUBMISSION PROCEDURE
Amended November 27, 2012
The following procedures apply to site plan review and will be followed by the Planning Board when
considering or acting upon a plat or application submitted to it for approval.
140.1
A completed application (as defined below) sufficient to invoke jurisdiction of the board shall be
submitted to the Planning Board per section 140.2 (a) below and accepted by the board only at a
public meeting of the board. The application shall include the names and addresses of the applicant
and all abutters as indicated in town records not more than 5 days before the day of filing. Abutters
shall also be identified on any plat submitted to the board.
140.2
A completed application to invoke the board jurisdiction under the site plan review regulations shall
consist of all applicable information, including that required in Section 150. Said application must
contain sufficient information to allow the board to make an informed decision. (Amended May 18,
2005)
a. Application Filing. A Site Plan Review Application must be completed and filed with the
Board at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the scheduled public meeting at which the
application shall be considered. All of the information required for a completed application
by Section 150 Submission Requirements, the Site Plan Review Checklist, request for waivers,
and any additional studies requested by the Board must accompany the application. Revised
plans, letters and other information and materials submitted to the Board or its agents after
the filing deadline of 21-days shall not be considered in determining the completeness of a
site plan for approval by the Planning Board for that meeting.
b. Waivers. The applicant may request in writing that the Board waive any of the requirements
contained in Section 150 Submission Requirements, the Site Plan Review Checklist and any
other standards contained in this regulation. Written waivers requests shall use the Waiver
Request Form found in Appendix K and provide the specific section number, title and a
justification, which explains how the waiver will not detract from the intent of these
regulations and must be provided to the PB with the application 21 days prior to the
proposed hearing. Requests for waivers should accompany the application filing and be
discussed with the Board’s designated representative prior to the submission of the
application. The designated representative will advise the Board on the request for a waiver.
The Board shall vote to grant or deny the applicant’s written request for a waiver from a
specific section of these regulations after a determination of application completeness and the
decision shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting and contained in a written response
to the applicant.
c. Preliminary Review. All site plan proposals must be reviewed by the Board’s designated
representative prior to the submission for Planning Board consideration of application
completeness. This process will review if the application and the plats conform to the
requirements of the Town’s land use regulations and ordinances. At this time, the applicant
will be informed of any deficiencies.

140.3
An application shall only be submitted to and accepted by the Board at a properly noticed public
hearing as required by RSA 676:4,I(d).
Upon a determination that the application is complete, the Board may vote to accept the application.
Immediately after acceptance of the application, the Board will determine if the application will
have regional impact per RSA 36:54 through 36:58. If the finding of the Board is that the application
is of regional significance, the Board will not commence review of the application until notice to the
regional abutters is officially made.
Once accepted, the applicant may present the proposal to the Board and the general public. The
board shall begin formal consideration of the application within 30 days after acceptance of the
completed application. The Board will ask questions and discuss the proposal, and then open the
floor to questions and comments from abutters and the general public. The date of acceptance
recorded in the minutes begins the sixty-five (65) day review period. Should the application not be
accepted, the Board must state the reasons and specify any additional requirements to the applicant
at the meeting and will provide a written response to the applicant listing the reasons for refusal to
accept.
Any plan revisions proposed subsequent to acceptance must be filed a minimum of 7 days prior
to the scheduled or continued public hearing.
Upon failure of the board to approve or disapprove the application, the applicant may obtain an
order by submitting a written request to the Selectmen requesting them to direct the Planning Board
to act within 30 days. Failure of the Planning Board to act upon such order of the Selectmen shall
constitute grounds for an applicant to petition the Superior Court in accordance with the provisions
of RSA [676:4]. (Amended April 3, 2001; March 2004, May 16, 2015)
140.4
The Planning Board may apply to the Selectmen for an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days
before acting to approve or disapprove an application. The applicant may waive the requirement
for Planning Board action within the time periods specified in Section 140.3 and consent to such
extension as may be mutually agreeable.
140.5
Notice to the applicant, abutters and the public shall be given as follows: The Planning Board shall
notify the abutters and the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the date upon
which the application will be formally submitted to the board. Notice shall be mailed at least 10
days prior to submission. Notice to the general public shall be given at the same time by posting a
copy of the notice in a public place within the town. The notice shall include a general description of
the proposal, which is the subject of the application and shall identify the applicant and the location
of the proposal. For any public hearing on the application, the same notice as required for notice of
submission of the application shall be given. If notice of public hearing has been included in the
notice of submission or any prior notice, additional notice of the public hearing is not required. Nor
shall additional notice be required of an adjourned session of a hearing when proper notice of the
date, time and place of the continuation of the adjourned session was made known at the prior hearing.
All costs of notice, whether mailed, posted or published, shall be paid in advance by the
applicant. Failure to pay such costs shall constitute valid grounds for the Planning Board to
terminate further consideration and to disapprove the plat without a public hearing.

140.6
The applicant shall be obliged to pay review fees as outlined in Appendix F, Planning Board Fee
Schedule For: Subdivisions, Site Plans, Sign Permits & Plan Recording. Reasonable fees may also be
imposed by the board to cover the total cost of special investigative studies, review of documents
and other matters which may be required by particular applications, including the costs for any
additional professional consultation deemed necessary by the board. 6-20-00
140.7
Action on a Completed Application. The Board shall act to approve, conditionally approve or
disapprove a completed application within sixty-five (65) days of its acceptance, subject to extension
or waiver as provided in Section 140.4 unless waived by the applicant or by the BOS as described
below.
If the Board has not taken action on a completed application within sixty-five (65) days of its
acceptance and has not obtained an extension, the applicant may obtain an order from the Board of
Selectmen directing the Board to act on the application within thirty (30) days If the Board fails to
act on the order, the Selectmen shall have forty (40) days to certify that the plat is approved unless
noncompliance with some specific provision of the Site Plan regulations, zoning ordinance or other
ordinance is identified in writing. Failure of the Selectmen to issue an order to the Board or act to
certify approval of the plat shall constitute grounds for the applicant to petition the superior court as
provided in RSA 676:4,I(c)(2).
a. Approval. Approval of the Site Plan plat shall be by affirmative vote of the majority of the
Board present at the meeting. The plat is certified by the signatures of the Board Chairman and
Vice-chairman and the date of approval on the plat. The Board will transmit the signed and
dated Mylar copy of the plat to the Hillsborough County Register of Deeds along with the
recording fees paid by the applicant. The approved plat will not be recorded until all fees have
been paid by the applicant. The applicant may not commence construction of the subdivision
until the plat is recorded.
b. Conditional Approval. The Board may grant conditional approval of an application if the
remaining actions on the application: are administrative in nature; involve the applicant’s
possession of permits and approvals granted by other boards or agencies, such as the NH
Departments of Transportation or Environmental Services; and/or do not involve discretionary
judgment by the Planning Board. In these instances, final approval may be granted without
further public hearing. A public hearing will be required to demonstrate compliance with the
terms of all other conditions pursuant to RSA 676:4,I(i). Final approval will be granted when the
conditions have been met to the satisfaction of the Board. The plat will not be recorded at the
Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds until all of the conditions have been met and confirmed
by the Planning Board’s designated representative, Chairman, and Vice-Chairman. If the
conditions are not met, the conditional approval shall be null and void after 90 days unless an
extension is granted by the Planning Board.
c. In case of disapproval of any application submitted to the Planning Board, the grounds for such
disapproval shall be adequately stated in the Planning Board’s meeting minutes as well as a
written notice of finding to the applicant.

163 EXTERNAL LIGHTING
(Adopted December 7, 2004)
163.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this regulation is to preserve the rural atmosphere and dark skies of the Town of
Litchfield, NH. Natural dark skies are the nighttime aspect of rural character. Increasing light
pollution and glare from inappropriate lighting degrades such rural character. This regulation is
intended to enhance public safety and welfare by providing for adequate and appropriate
outdoor lighting, providing for lighting that will complement the character of the Town of
Litchfield, reduce glare, minimize light trespass, reduce the cost and waste of unnecessary energy
consumption and prevent the degradation of the night sky.
163.2 APPLICABILITY.
Detailed lighting requirements shall be set forth in these Town of Litchfield Site Plan Review
Regulations and shall apply to all outdoor lighting in non-residential and multi-family
developments in the Town of Litchfield requiring site plan approval from the Planning Board, as
well as all new lighting. Home Occupations requiring Planning Board site plan review are
required to comply with this Section. This regulation takes effect immediately upon adoption and
certification by the Town Clerk. (Amended December 5, 2017)
a. Though they are not subject to permitting through this regulation, residential developers and
homeowners are encouraged to use full cutoff energy efficient lighting fixtures and prevent
light trespass onto neighboring properties.
b. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) standards shall apply to
those applications not specifically addressed in these regulations. Standards are available in
print and electronically at (http://www.iesna.org) (Amended December 6, 2016)
c. Proposed lighting installations or modifications that are not covered by these regulations
shall conform to the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) standards.
d. A "grandfathered" luminaire, is pre-existing outdoor lighting in use prior to the adoption of
this regulation and is exempt from this regulation. (Amended December 5, 2017)
163.3 RESERVED (DEFINITIONS REPEALED MAY 18, 2005) SEE SECTION 115 DEFINITIONS
163.4 GENERAL STANDARDS.
Lighting and lights shall be shielded or buffered to prevent off-site glare, sky-glow and light
trespass.
Full cut-off or partial cut-off fixtures, when approved, are to be used, except that low-level
lighting (Globe style, non-cut-off types) for walkways and landscape lighting may be approved
when an acceptable design meeting the Purpose and Intent of this regulation is submitted.
(Amended December 5, 2017)
Wherever outside lighting is proposed in a site plan review, it shall be accompanied by a formal
lighting plan, prepared to scale. The lighting plan shall require Planning Board approval. Home
Occupations are exempt from a formal plan but are subject to site plan review regulations. When
any site plan proposes installed street, common or public area outdoor lighting, the final plan
shall contain a statement certifying that the applicable provisions of this regulation shall be
LITCHFIELD LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Site Plan Review Regulations
04-225LIT-2017_SP_Reg.doc Page 65. Amended December 5, 2017
adhered to. Lights not required for safety or security shall be turned off within a reasonable time
of when a business or activity closes or ceases, as set forth in this regulation.
This regulation shall not apply to temporary decorative lighting, which may include colored
lamps, such as holiday lighting. Commercial lighting shall meet minimum IESNA illumination
levels while not exceeding IESNA uniformity ratios and average illumination recommendations.
163.5 LIGHTING PLAN.
Wherever outside lighting is proposed in a site plan review, it shall be accompanied by a lighting
plan that shall show:
a. The location of the site where outdoor lighting fixtures will be installed.
b. Scaled plans indicating the location of outdoor lighting fixtures on the site, the height of each
fixture, the type(s) of outdoor lighting proposed and the lamp type (i.e. Metal Halide, High
Pressure Sodium), level of wattage and initial lumens for all light sources.
c. A description of the outdoor lighting fixtures including but not limited to manufacturer’s
catalog descriptions and drawings. The required plans and descriptions shall be sufficiently
complete to enable the Planning Board to readily determine compliance with the
requirements of this regulation. If necessary, the Planning Board may require the applicant to
submit further evidence of proper design and compliance.
d. The Planning Board requires an iso-lux / footcandle plan indicating levels of illumination, in
footcandles, at ground level. The maintained horizontal illuminance standards set by the
Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) shall be observed.
e. If any site plan or subdivision plan proposes to have installed street, common or public area
outdoor lighting, the final plat shall contain a statement certifying that the applicable
provisions of these regulations shall be adhered to.
Should any outdoor light fixture, or the type of light source therein, be changed after the site plan
approval has been issued, and would present a different result than the submitted iso-lux /
footcandle illumination plan, an amended site plan shall be submitted to the Planning Board.
Changes requiring an amended site plan include, but are not limited to pole or luminaire height,
orientation, intensity, location, quantity and reduced Color Rendering Index (CRI). Where fixture
and/or luminaries are replaced with comparable or superior equipment, an amendment or
change request shall be submitted in writing to the Building Inspector for approval, together with
adequate information to assure compliance with this regulation. An iso-lux / footcandle plan
depicting pre and post illumination levels and/or manufacturers specifications data may be
adequate to make a determination. Any request for amendment or change must be received and
approved by either the Planning Board or Building Inspector prior to substitution.
163.6 CONTROL OF GLARE AND LIGHT TRESPASS.
a. Any luminaire with a lamp or lamps rated at a total of more than 1,800 lumens shall be of
fully shielded (cutoff) design and shall not emit any direct light above a horizontal plane
passing through the lowest part of the light emitting luminaire.
b. Luminaires, regardless of lumen rating, shall be equipped with whatever additional
shielding, lenses, or cutoff devices are required to eliminate light trespass onto any street or
abutting lot or parcel and to eliminate glare perceptible to persons on abutting land.
c. Flood or spot luminaires shall be full cut-off if they are 900 lumens or more.

175.3 AS-BUILT PLANS REQUIRED
Any project involving the construction of more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross
floor area, thirty thousand (30,000) square feet of impervious surface, or any Stormwater
Management construction, including required driveway culverts, shall provide the Planning
Board or Town Engineer and/or Code Enforcement Officer with a set of construction plans
showing the building(s) and site improvements as actually constructed on the site. These "asbuilt"
plans shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy
for the project or occupancy of the building. A copy of this plan shall also be provided the
Planning Board for their records. (Amended July 18, 2006)
As-Built plans are required for any plan with greater than 10,000 S.F. of floor area, 30,000
SF. of impervious surface or which stormwater management devices will be constructed.
175.4 INSPECTIONS AND SITE VISITS
Prior to approval, site visits may be required by the planning board to better understand the
features of the land and the relationship and effect of the proposed development on the land and
the abutters. Proposed centerline to roads and/or access-ways, test-pits, existing lot lines or other
markings typical in the engineering process may be required prior to a site walk to aid the Board.
Pre-approval site inspections may be required by the Planning Board to best determine
the land characteristics before engineering plans are detailed. Road centerlines,
wetlands, existing bounds and test pit locations should be marked.
A Technical Review Fee for engineering inspections for approved site plans shall commence the
establishment of an escrow account or other account for expenses for plan review and inspections
incurred by the Planning Board, in accordance with RSA 674:44 V and RSA 676:4 I (g), shall be
borne by the applicant. This includes, but is not limited to, review by consulting engineers or
other consultants to assess the environmental impact, hydrological impact, ground water quality
impact, traffic impact, or any other study deemed necessary by the Planning Board in order to
make an informed decision.
Inspections include verification of overall compliance with the approved site plan. In the case of
inspections, funds are due prior to commencing site work or construction and not at the time of
application. Funds from the account will be disbursed on a monthly basis upon satisfactory
completion of service. Inspection reports shall be provided to the Board for their records. At any
time the funds in this account are depleted to $1,500.00 (one thousand five hundred), and prior to
commencement of any new inspections, the account shall be replenished by the applicant to the
full amount required in the Fee Schedule, as established by the Planning Board or Board of
Selectmen.
The use of escrow accounts for engineering inspections is cumbersome on part time staff in
smaller towns. Cash or other means of secure payment may be approved for short duration
projects.
Upon written request by the applicant, any remaining funds in excess of $5.00 (five) shall be
returned to the applicant, provided the municipality receives documentation from the
engineer/inspector that the project has been completed according to the approved plans and to
the satisfaction of the project inspector. The building inspector shall not issue a Certificate of
occupancy and/or final performance guarantees shall not be released until all required
improvements are constructed as shown on the approved site plan and any final inspections or
approvals completed.
LITCHFIELD LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Site Plan Review Regulations
04-225LIT-2017_SP_Reg.doc Page 75. Amended December 5, 2017
If permission to inspect is denied by the landowner, the designated agent shall secure an
administrative inspection warrant from the district or Superior Court under RSA 595-B,
Administrative Inspection Warrants.
Money to cover inspections and reviews should be placed in escrow prior to the
inspections in order to ensure that the community is not stuck with the bill. Payment for
inspections or reviews should be disbursed monthly to the inspector in accordance with
the fee schedule.
Smaller towns may accept cash or other secure methods instead of cumbersome escrow
accounts.
A Certificate of Occupancy, allowing the occupation of the building for its stated
purpose will not be issued unless the project is completed in accordance with the
approved plans.
175.5 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
175.5.1 Application
The Planning Board may require the posting of an improvement guarantee in such amount and
form as specified in Performance Guaranty/Bonding Requirements and Procedures as found in
Appendix A of the Town of Litchfield’s regulations, as is reasonably necessary to ensure the
proper installation of all on and off-site improvements required as conditions of approval. The
nature and duration of the guarantee shall be structured to achieve this goal without adding
unnecessary costs to the applicant.
Upon substantial completion of all required improvements, the developer shall notify the
Planning Board, in writing, of the completion or substantial completion of improvements, and
shall send a copy of such notice to the appropriate municipal officials. The respective
municipal officials shall inspect all improvements and shall file a report indicating approval,
partial approval, or rejection of such improvements with a statement of reasons for any
rejection.
The Planning Board shall approve, partially approve, or reject the improvements on the basis
of the report of the municipal officials. If the improvements are approved, the guarantee shall
be released. Where partial approval is granted, the developer shall be released from liability
only for that portion of the improvements approved.
a. Form of Guarantee. Performance guarantees may be provided by a variety of means, as
detailed in Appendix A, that shall be approved as to form and enforceability by the
Planning Board and Municipal Attorney.
Reasonable secured funds may be required to ensure completion of all required on and
off-site improvements. This section prevents the community from having to complete the
improvements if the developer fails to do so.
The security will be released once an inspection confirms they are completed as required.
A reduction in the guarantee will be granted for partially approved improvements. For
example, the developer may construct part of a roadway to access a certain phase of the
development. Once completed, the security for this section of roadway can be released.

Planning Board or Town Engineer/Inspector/Code Enforcement Officer provided that any such
change does not affect compliance with the standards or alter the essential nature of the proposal.
The Planning Board or Town Engineer/ Inspector/Code Enforcement Officer shall endorse any
such change in writing on the approved plan.
175.7 MAJOR CHANGES TO APPROVED PLANS
Approvals of site plans are dependent upon and limited to the proposals and plans contained in
the application and supporting documents submitted and affirmed to by the applicant. Any
variation from the plans, proposals, and supporting documents, except for minor changes that do
not affect approval standards, are subject to review and approval in a formal public hearing after
proper abutter notification. Engineering and studies applicable to the new site plan may be
resubmitted in order to reduce cost to the applicant, at the Boards discretion.
175.8 EXPIRATION OF APPROVED PLANS (VESTING)
In accordance with RSA 674:39, Five Year Exemption, site plan approvals shall become vested from
subsequent changes to zoning ordinances and regulations for a period of five (5) years, provided
“active and substantial development and building” as defined by the Planning Board, has
occurred within twenty-four (24) months of the date of final approval, the exception being those
ordinances and regulations which expressly protect public health standards. If “active and
substantial development and building” has not been achieved within twenty-four (24) months,
the plan shall not be vested and is subject to changes in zoning and regulations. If site
development and/or construction do not achieve “substantial completion” within five (5) years
from the date of site plan approval, the approved plan may be subject to revocation pursuant to
RSA 676:4-a. Once “substantial completion” of the improvements shown on the subdivision plat
has occurred in compliance with the terms of approval the plan shall be vested from any
subsequent changes to the Zoning Ordinance and/or Site Plan Review, and Subdivision
Regulations, except impact fees. If the plan does not achieve substantial completion within five
(5) years, the applicant may reapply for site plan approval. The applicant may request an
extension of the approval deadline prior to the expiration of the period. Such request shall be in
writing and shall be made to the Planning Board. The Planning Board may grant up to two (2),
six (6) month extensions to the periods if the approved plan conforms to the ordinances and
regulations in effect at the time the extension is granted and any and all federal and state
approvals and permits are current.

4.0 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Stormwater and Erosion Control measures shall comply with Appendix D, (Stormwater Management and
Erosion Control). The entity or individual responsible for construction site operations shall control runoff,
erosion and sediment during and after construction through any measure approved by the Planning Board
or Town Engineer. In each instance, the measure or measures shall be suitable to the site and subject to
approval by the Planning Board and/or the Town Engineer. All runoff, erosion and sediment control
measures and the design of all drainage structures and systems shall meet the design standards and
specifications set forth in these regulations, the current version of Stormwater Management and Erosion
and Sediment Control Handbook for Urban and Developing Areas of New Hampshire prepared by the
USDA - Soil Conservation Service (now Natural Resource Conservation Service), NHDES and
Rockingham County SCS, 1992, as amended and the current Manual on Drainage Design for Highways,
published by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation. (Amended May 2003)
4.01 Definitions – (See additional definitions in Appendix D)
Erosion: The wearing away of the land surface by the action of wind, water or gravity.
Sediment: Solid material, both mineral and organic, that is in suspension, is being transported, or has
been moved from its site of origin by air, water or gravity as a product of erosion.
Runoff: The portion of precipitation that makes its way overland toward stream channels or lakes.
Measure: A specific procedure designed to control runoff, erosion or sediment.
4.1 Hydrology: Runoff Calculation Methods
The calculation of runoff is of prime importance to the overall scheme of drainage design. The Town of
Litchfield approves four methods to compute runoff.
a. The Rational Method - This method is usually used when the drainage area is less than 200 acres. It
is also used extensively for on-site design.
b. The NEHL-AWM Method - This method is usually used when the drainage area is greater than one
square mile.
c. The Potter Method - This method is usually used when the drainage area is between 200 and 1000
acres. This method provides a check on either of the preceding methods.
d. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Method - This method can be used when the drainage area is
greater than 10 acres. The design storm shall be a 10 year or 25 year, 24-hour rainfall of a storm
distribution Type III.
The methodology used in computing the runoff for the Rational Method, NEHL-AWM Method and
Potter Method is found in the NHDOT Drainage Manual as well as many popular Engineering Texts.

The following three SCS publications, which provide the details on hydrologic analyses using the SCS methods,
are widely distributed and used:
* NEH-4: Hydrology, Section 4, National Engineering Handbook.
* TR-20: Computer Program for Project Formulation, Hydrology, Technical Release No. 20.
* TR-55: Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55.
4.2 Drainage Design Criteria
The following design criteria shall apply to proposed drainage systems:
a. Cross Culvert Pipes: 25-year storm frequency; check impacts for 50-year storm.
b. Closed Drain System: 10-year storm frequency; check impacts at sag points for a 25-year storm.
c. Storm Water Detention Facilities: 25-year storm frequency; check impacts for 50-year storm.
d. Storm Water Retention Facilities: 25-year storm frequency; check impacts for 50-year storm.
e. Box Culverts and Bridges: 50-year storm frequency; check impacts for 100-year storm.
The Planning Board reserves the right to require that storm drain systems be designed for less frequent,
more intense rainfalls where conditions warrant.
4.3 Drainage Pipe Design
a. Documentation of Computations for Culvert Pipes: All computations for culvert pipes shall be
documented and included in the drainage report. These shall be performed under the supervision of
a NH Licensed Professional Engineer. The Professional Engineer shall stamp and sign the drainage
report.
b. Use of Rainfall and Floods Records: All available records concerning rainfall and floods shall be
used in the design of culverts and storm sewers.
c. Pipe Culvert Design: Pipe culverts will be designed as open flow channels. They will either be
under inlet or outlet control. The exact control can be found by following the procedure outlined in
"Hydraulic Charts for the Selection of Highway Culverts", published by the Bureau of Public roads
as H.E.C. No. 5. This material can also be found in the NHDOT Drainage Manual.
d. Pipe Culvert Size: Minimum pipe culvert sizes are as follows:
* Roadways - 15"
* Drives - 12"
e. Pipe Culvert Bridge: Pipe culverts with a span of 10 feet or more will be considered a bridge.
f. Natural Channel Culverts: It is preferred that culverts be located to fit natural channels in lines and
grade.
g. Culvert Flow Minimums: The minimum grade of culverts shall be 0.4% or able to maintain a
velocity of 2 fps while flowing one-third full.
h. Culvert Collars: Collars will be designed for culverts whose grades exceed 20%.
i. Outlet Protection: When the computed outlet velocity is in the range beyond normal design of 10
fps, additional outlet protection shall be considered.

determine the adjusted bond amount. This number shall be reviewed by the Board and the
consulting engineer on a biennial basis.
d. Calculation. The Post Construction Performance Bond will be calculated by multiplying the
linear footage of the roadway to be bonded times $15.00 times the ENR adjustment factor.
Example: The bond required for 1,000 feet of roadway at the time when the ENR is 9,870 is
calculated as
1,000 feet X $15.00 X 9,870 /9,500 = $ 15,584
e. The Planning Board shall vote to approve the release of the Maintenance Bond after review of a
written report/recommendation from the Town Road Agent and designated representative (E.g.
Consulting engineer and/or staff). Any release of the maintenance bond amount requires written
authorization from the Board of Selectmen.

3.2 Excavation
a. Topsoil: Topsoil and other desirable humus material shall be removed in excavation areas and also
in fill areas to such depths as directed by the Road Agent or Consulting Engineer.
b. Unsuitable Subgrade Material: All stumps, soft clay, mulch, loam, peat and all other yielding
material or material subject to organic decomposition, shall be removed from the entire area within
the slope limits in accordance with the "Standard Specifications". In those locations where the
alignment crosses swamp or marshlands, or other similar soil that is incapable of withstanding
expected loads, such inadequate soil shall be entirely removed and replaced with adequate material.
The materials so removed shall not be placed in embankment, but may be used in flattening
embankment slopes or for filling low spots outside the road section. The Planning Board may
require the developer to submit evidence of boring and/or other soil investigations to determine the
depth, composition and stability of the subgrade within the road section.
c. Rock Excavation: All boulders shall be broken off to a depth of not less than 24 inches below
subgrade. Solid rock shall be removed also to a depth of not less than 24 inches below subgrade and
as required for ditches in cut sections. The finish side slopes shall be constructed as shown on plan
approved by the Planning Board and this shall be in conformance with the roadway ledge excavation
detail provided with the roadway typical section.
d. Common Excavation: Common excavation consisting of all excavation not included in the above
classifications shall be removed. With the approval of the Road Agent, suitable material may be
used in fill areas and unsuitable material may be used to flatten slopes where possible.
3.3 Embankment
a. Materials: Embankments shall be formed of suitable and acceptable excavated material and brought
to the required lines and grades. The materials for embankments and subgrades shall be placed in
successive compacted horizontal layers not exceeding twelve (12) inches in loose depth, extending
across the entire fill area. They shall be spread by a bulldozer or other acceptable methods, and shall
be thoroughly compacted. Successive layers shall not be placed until the layer under construction
shall have been thoroughly compacted. Where embankments are made of rock, the rock shall be so
deposited that all voids are filled with earth and in such a way that the compaction specified above
may be secured.
b. Backfill of Holes: Holes resulting from removal of stumps, boulders, and the like, within the zone
of anticipated frost action, shall be filled and compacted with material similar to that surrounding the
hole.
c. Waste Material: Waste materials from clearing, grubbing, and roadside cleanup and from rock,
muck, and common excavation classified by the Road Agent as unsuitable for use in construction of
roads, streets, and landscaping shall be disposed of in an approved stump dump, on-site, or chopped.
d. Rock Embankment: Rock embankment shall consist of rock fragments placed in layers not to
exceed 4 feet. The rock lifts shall be worked in such a manner as to close the voids with spalls and
fines when available, otherwise use earth to make a tight surface prior to placing the next lift.
e. Grading: Embankments shall be graded at all times to insure the run-off of water. Any saturation of
nonporous material due to the subdivider's selected method of operation will occasion suspension of
additional work by the Road Agent or the Consulting Engineer until the situation has been rectified.

develops that additional drainage pipes or structures are needed, the Consulting Engineer shall
require, with Planning Board approval, such additional installation(s) before acceptance of the
road(s). (Amended May 2003)
b. Site Conditions: Minor revisions to the location of the proposed drainage pipes and structures due to
varying site conditions may be made in the field providing intent of the drainage design is not
compromised.
5.2 Culverts
a. Lengths: In addition to the location as shown on the approved plans the length of a culvert structure
shall be graphically determined by cross-section scale drawing(s) of the proposed street showing
existing ground, side ditches, back slope(s), side slope(s), with headwall(s) if required. Culvert
length shall not be compromised and culvert construction shall not result in a roadside safety hazard
to motorists or pedestrians. Culverts without headwalls or drop inlets shall extend to the intersection
of the street side slope in an earth fill section; or with the backslope in an earth set section governed
by the cover over the culvert specified below. Culverts with headwalls may be shorter as governed
by the intersection of the street side slope with the back of the headwall 5 inches below the top of the
headwall.
b. Materials: Drainpipes shall be Reinforced Concrete Pipes. No substitution of pipe material shall be
made without approval of the Road Agent or the Consulting Engineer.

225I-80_2009_LIT_App_B_Construction.doc
6.0 SUBGRADE
6.1 Fine Grading
Upon completion of excavation, placement of embankment and installation and backfilling of drainage
structures, the subgrade shall be fine graded to conform to the profile grade for subgrade and cross slope.
High slopes shall be honed down and low spots filled with acceptable material. The process of rolling or
vibration compacting shall continue until no further depressions result. Shoulders, slopes and ditches
shall be shaped to reasonably smooth surfaces in keeping with the character of the adjacent terrain and
merge into it without any noticeable break. Culverts and waterways shall be cleared of all obstructions.
Rubbish, brush, loose rock, boulders and all other debris from the construction work shall be removed
and disposed of. The entire roadway must present a uniformly finished appearance at the completion of
fine grading. The Road Agent and the Consulting Engineer shall be notified so that approval of fine
grading of the subgrade, shoulders, side slopes and ditches can be made before any further work can
progress.
6.2 Grade Stakes
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to have grade stakes put in at 50-foot intervals. Each stake
shall be driven firmly beyond the toe or top of the slope in a location where it will not be disturbed by
construction operations and be clearly marked to give the following information:
* Station
* Offset from centerline
* Cut or fill to finished centerline grade.
The developer shall preserve the grade stakes until the completion of the streets, and, if stakes are
removed or destroyed so that the Consulting Engineer cannot readily check the grade at any location, the
stakes shall be replaced at the expense of the developer.
7.0 ROADWAY BASE COURSE
7.1 Gravel Base Course
The base of the road shall be composed of a minimum twelve (12) inches of bank-run gravel, including
material up to six (6) inches diameter. The gravel shall meet the specifications for gravel set forth in
Section 304 of the "Standard Specifications". The base shall be laid in separate six (6) inch compacted
layers to the required width, centered within the right-of-way.
7.2 Crushed Gravel Base Course
On the base shall be laid a minimum of six (6) inches of crushed gravel (12” for arterial roadways),
spread to the required width (see approved typical section for the exact crushed gravel thickness). The
crushed gravel shall meet the specifications for crushed gravel set forth in Section 304 of the "Standard
Specifications".

APPENDIX B - Construction Requirements
Page 7 of 8. Amended May 6, 2003
225I-80_2009_LIT_App_B_Construction.doc
7.3 Sand Course
In ledge or rock cuts a 24" sand blanket shall be constructed. The sand shall meet the specifications for
sand set forth in Section 304 of the "Standard Specifications".
7.4 Grading Procedure
The subgrade shall be to the specified crown and grade and maintained in a smooth condition, free from
holes and ruts. If the hauling equipment should cause ruts in the subgrade or previously placed base
course, the equipment shall be operated only on the course being placed, behind the spreading
equipment.
Care shall be taken to avoid segregation when placing sand, gravel and crushed gravel. When base
course material is dumped in piles, it shall be dumped in the course being placed, and spread at once onto
the previously placed layer. If spreading equipment is not available, dumping will not be permitted.
Any separation, which occurs, shall be remedied or the materials removed and replaced at the
subdivider's expense.
Each entire layer of gravel shall be thoroughly scarified for the full depth of the layer to bring all
oversized stones to the surface for disposal prior to placing the subsequent course. Such scarifying will
not be required when the Contractor's method of operation is such that oversized stones are not delivered
to the project.
Previously tested and accepted materials contaminated by earthen, organic, or other foreign matter, or
degraded by hauling equipment, to such an extent that the materials cease to meet the requirements, shall
be removed and replaced or otherwise made acceptable at the Contractor's expense.
To prevent segregation of crushed gravel during spreading and to assist in obtaining the required density
of the mixture, water shall be added to the crushed gravel prior to performing the grading operations.
The course shall be maintained in a moist condition until it is covered. Water shall be uniformly applied
over the base courses during compaction in the amount necessary for proper consolidation.
The compaction of sand, gravel and crushed gravel shall be done with an approved vibratory roller until
95% of maximum density is achieved.
7.5 Fine Grading Procedure
Prior to the start of fine grading, the contractor shall stakeout the centerline of the road at 50 foot
intervals. The stakes shall be flagged in blue showing crushed gravel grade and corresponding slope
grade on side slopes. These stakes and grades shall be kept throughout the fine grading operation in
order to check alignment and crown in the road and may not be removed until just prior to paving.
The contractor shall have the following equipment on site prior to starting fine grading: Grader with a
straight edge, water truck, and an 8-1/2 ton steel drum vibratory roller.
Grades shall be checked and rechecked during final grading in order to get a uniform grade. Grades shall
be maintained in front of the water trucks and rollers in order to get grade and essential compaction.
This grade shall remain undisturbed until paving.

7.6 Winter Construction Methods
Base course material shall not be placed upon or above frozen material. If the density requirements are
not fulfilled for any layer before the material freezes, not further material shall be placed upon that layer.
8.0 ROADWAY PAVEMENT
The pavement shall be a two-course hot bituminous pavement constructed to the widths shown on the
approved typical section and will include a one (1) inch wearing surface (after compaction). The average
application rate shall be .057 tons per square yard per inch of thickness.
9.0 SIDE SLOPES
A minimum of three (3) inches of topsoil shall be provided to cover over all finished slopes, and it shall
be spread uniformly over all finished slopes. Finished slopes shall be loamed, fertilized, limed, seeded
and mulched in accordance with Sections 641 through 647 of the "Standard Specifications".
10.0 MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
10.1 Utilities
Utilities will be placed after the project has been brought to subgrade and rough slope work has been
completed. The lines will be inspected by their respective companies. It is recommended that all
electric, telephone, cable, and other overhead lines will be placed underground.
10.2 Guardrail
Guardrail will be required where slopes extend more than 10 feet on a 2:1 slope or in other hazardous
areas, which are determined by the Road Agent and the Planning Board. The guardrail and associated
terminal units shall be constructed at location shown in the roadway typical section.

be trapped and retained within the project area using approved measures. Wetland areas and
surface waters shall be protected from sediment.
f. Off-site surface water and runoff from undisturbed areas shall be diverted away from disturbed
areas where feasible or carried non-erosively through the project area. Integrity of downstream
drainage systems shall be maintained.
g. Measures shall be taken to control the post-development peak rate of runoff so that it does not
exceed pre-development runoff for the 2-year, 24-hour storm event and for additional storm event
frequencies as specified in the design criteria of the “Stormwater Management and Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook for Urban and Developing Areas in New Hampshire.”
h. Priority should be given to preserving natural drainage systems including perennial and
intermittent streams, wetlands, swales, and drainage ditches for conveyance of runoff leaving the
project area.

170.9 Fields in Sloping Ground:
a. In locations where the ground over the absorption field area slopes (falls greater than six
inches (6") in any direction within field area) a system of serial distribution trenches
following the contours of the land will be used. The trenches will be installed at different
elevations, but the bottom of each individual trench shall be level throughout its entire
length.
b. Trenches shall be connected with a water-tight overflow line in such a manner that a
trench will be filled with effluent to the depth of the coarse material before the effluent
flows to the next lower trench.
c. The overflow line shall be a four-inch (4") water-right line with direct connections to the
distribution tiles in adjacent trenches. Distribution tile line shall have a level grade.
d. There shall be undisturbed earth between trenches. At the point where an overflow pipe
leaves an absorption trench, the trench of this pipe shall be dug no deeper than the top of
the coarse material interface. Overflow lines shall rest on undisturbed earth and backfill
shall be carefully tamped.
e. The inlet to a trench should be placed as far as practical from the outlet (overflow) from
the same trench.
170.10 Effluent from the septic tank shall be conducted to the absorption system through a waterright
line with a grade of at least 1/4 inch per foot and not more than 3/4 inch per foot (unless
a proper baffle is installed in a distribution box approved by the Health Officer) to the
distribution box which shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the necessary field lateral
lines. The invert of all outlets shall be level and the inlet invert shall be at least one inch (1")
above the outlet invert.
170.11 Pipe used for the lines between the septic tank and the absorption field and all lines within
ten feet (10') of dwellings and under paved areas shall comply with the National Plumbing
Code ASA-A 40.8. Pipes used under driveways or other areas subject to heavy loads shall be
installed to withstand the imposed loads and shall be water-tight. Such sections shall not be
considered in determining the effective absorption area.
170.12 Pipe used in the absorption field shall comply with the National Plumbing Code ASA-A 40.8.
The opening between joints shall be no greater than 1/4 inch.
170.13 All open joints shall be protected to effectively eliminate soil infiltration.
170.14 Filter material shall be of crushed stone, shall vary from 1/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches and shall be
free from fines, dust, sand or clay. The filter material shall completely encase the tile or
perforated pipe.
170.15 An effective barrier of straw or hay at least two inches (2") thick when compacted shall be
placed over the filter material to prevent infiltration of the back fill.
170.16 Heavy equipment shall not be driven over the trenches during backfill or after completion of
the absorption field.

180.8 An effective barrier of two inches (2") of compacted straw or hay shall be provided between
the filter material and the backfill.
180.9 All backfilling shall be done from the back of the bed, or by hand, to avoid disarrangement
and breakage of tile and barrier. Avoid reductionary natural absorptive compaction or
smearing.
190 PERCOLATION TESTS
190.1
a. Prior to the approval of any subdivision, an adequate number of tests shall be made (one
per three (3) acres or, if soil conditions indicate, a greater number will be required) to
show clearly the absorptive ability of the soil throughout the tract, and shall be approved
by the Health Officer.
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
HEALTH REGULATION
Page 8. Recodified March, 1986
225I-90_2009_LIT_HR_Reg.doc
b. Each test hole shall be located by a key number on a topographical plan showing twofoot
(2') contour intervals on land generally sloping two percent (2%) or less and a five
foot (5') contour plan on land of generally greater slopes, at a scale of one inch equal to
fifty feet (1" = 50').
c. Subsurface exploration shall be made (one per three (3) areas, or if subsoil conditions
indicate, a greater number will be required) to show clearly the type of soil existing
beneath the absorption area. Explorations shall extend to a point at least ten feet (10')
below the finish grade of the proposed absorption areas or to refusal.
190.2 Individual Lots:
a. One (1) percolation test shall be made (or if site conditions so indicate, several tests in
separate holes spaced uniformly over the proposed site) within the proposed absorption
area prior to the approval of the lot.
b. Subsurface exploration shall be made in the proposed absorption site. Exploration shall
extend to a point at least ten feet (10') below the finish grade or to refusal.
c. Each test hole shall be located by a key number on a topographical plan showing twofoot
(2') contour intervals on land generally sloping two percent (2%) or less and a five
foot (5') contour plan on land of generally greater slopes, at a scale of one inch equal to
twenty feet (1" = 20').
d. If in the opinion of the Health Officer, there is adequate information on the subdivision
plan, subsurface exploration on an individual lot in a subdivision may not be required.
e. A profile and construction plan of subsurface sewage or waste disposal systems shall be
made showing profile of disposal system and construction details, at a scale of 1/4" = 1').
190.3 Procedure:
All percolation tests required shall be performed in accordance with the following:
a. Dig or bore the holes with horizontal dimensions from four to twelve inches (4-12") and
vertical sides to the depth of the bottom of the proposed absorption device. Holes can be
bored with four-inch (4") diameter post-hole type auger.
b. Roughen or scratch the bottom and sides of the holes to provide a natural surface.
Remove all loose materials from the hole. Place about two inches (2") of coarse sand or
fine gravel in the hole to prevent bottom scouring.
c. Fill the hole with clear water to a minimum depth of twelve inches (12") over the gravel.
By refilling or by supplying a surplus reservoir of water (automatic siphon), keep water
in hole for at least four (4) hours, and preferably overnight. In granular soil, i.e., GW,
GP, SW, or SP classified according to the "Unified Soils Classification" system (see
Addendum), the test can be made after the water from one filling has seeped away.
d. Percolation rate measurement should be made on the day following the saturation
process, except in sandy soils.
e. If water remains in the test hole after overnight saturation, adjust the depth to twelve
inches (12") over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, measure the drop in water
TOWN OF LITCHFIELD, NH
HEALTH REGULATION
Page 9. Recodified March, 1986
225I-90_2009_LIT_HR_Reg.doc
level, at approximately thirty (30) minute intervals over a four (4) hour period. The drop
which occurs during the final thirty (30) minute period is used to calculate the
percolation rate.
f. If no water remains in the hole after overnight saturation add clear water t a depth of
about twelve inches (12") over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, measure the
height of the water surface at approximately thirty (30) minute intervals over a four (4)
hour period, refilling the hole to a depth of six inches (6") when the percolation rate
indicates the hole will run dry before the next reading is made. The drop which occurs
during the final thirty (30) minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate.
Note: If a hole must be refilled to obtain a final thirty (30) minute reading, determine
from the previous reading the water level drop during that interval. Add water until the
level above the bottom equals this figure plus one-half inch (1/2"). Continue, measure
drop during the final thirty (30) minute period.
g. In sandy soils, or other soils in which the first twelve inches (12") of water seeps away in
less than thirty (30) minutes after the overnight saturation period, the time interval
between measurements can be taken as ten (10) minutes and the test run over a period of
one (1) hour. The drop which occurs in the final ten (10) minute period is used to
calculate the percolation rate.
200 ENFORCEMENT
200.1 No sewage disposal system shall be installed, altered or maintained in the Town of Litchfield,
NH unless in conformity with the above regulations.
200.2 A permit for the installation and/or alternation of sewage or waste disposal system shall be
obtained from the Health Officer prior to any work on any system. A minimum of 24 hours
notice shall be given prior to the starting of the work. A plot plan showing the location of
test holes, percolation rate and construction detail of the entire disposal system and a fee of
$5.00 shall accompany the permit application obtained from the Health officer.
200.3 A penalty of $10.00 shall be imposed on the owner and/or the installer for failure to comply
with these regulations. Each day of continuance shall constitute a new offense. Repeated
violation by an installer shall prohibit him from applying for any installation in Litchfield for
a period of one (1) year from the date of violation.
200.4 Inspection shall be made by the Health Officer when all the stone is in place but the pipe
lines are exposed.
