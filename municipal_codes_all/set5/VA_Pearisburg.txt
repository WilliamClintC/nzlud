Checklist of Up-to-Date Pages
(This checklist will be updated with the printing of each Supplement)
From our experience in publishing Loose-leaf Supplements on a page-for-page substitution basis, it has become evident that through usage and supplementation many pages can be inserted and removed in error.
The following listing is included in this Code as a ready guide for the user to determine whether the Code volume properly reflects the latest printing of each page.
In the first column all page numbers are listed in sequence. The second column reflects the latest printing of the pages as they should appear in an up-to-date volume. The letters "OC" indicate the pages have not been reprinted in the Supplement Service and appear as published for the original Code. When a page has been reprinted or printed in the Supplement Service, this column reflects the identification number or Supplement Number printed on the bottom of the page.
In addition to assisting existing holders of the Code, this list may be used in compiling an up-to-date copy from the original Code and subsequent Supplements.

BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS § 22-60
(c) The town through its own agents or employees may remove, repair or secure any building, wall or any other structure which might endanger the public health or safety of other residents of the town if the owner and lienholder of the property fails to do so within 30 days following the later of the return of the certified mail receipt or newspaper publication.

Supp. No. 21 CD22:5
threat to public safety and such fact is stated in the notice, the town may take action to prevent unauthorized access to the building within seven days of such notice. Repair of the structure may include maintenance work to the exterior of a building to prevent deterioration of the building or adjacent buildings.
(d) In the event the town, through its own agents or employees removes, repairs or secures any building, wall or any other structure pursuant to this section, the cost or expenses thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by the owners of such property and may be collected by the town as taxes and levies are collected.
(e) Every charge authorized by this section which remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property ranking on a parity with liens for unpaid local taxes and enforceable in the same manner as provided Code of Virginia, title 58.1, chapter 39, articles 3 and 4, as amended. The town may waive such liens in order to facilitate the sale of the property. Such liens may be waived only as to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and who has no business association with the owner. All such liens shall remain a personal obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were imposed.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with the written consent of the property owner, the town may, through its agents or employees, demolish or remove a derelict nonresidential building or structure provided that such building or structure is neither located within or determined to be a contributing property within a state or local historic district nor individually designated in the Virginia Landmarks Register. The property owner’s written consent shall identify whether the property is subject to a first lien evidenced by a recorded deed of trust or mortgage and, if so, shall document the property owner’s best reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the first lienholder or the first lienholder’s authorized agent. The costs of such demolition or removal shall constitute a lien against such property. In the event the consent of the first lienholder or the first lienholder’s authorized agent is obtained, such lien shall rank on a parity with liens for unpaid local taxes and be enforceable in the same manner as provided in subsection (d). In the event the consent of the first lienholder or the first lienholder’s authorized agent is not obtained, such lien shall be subordinate to that first lien but shall otherwise be subject to subsection (e).
(g) The remedies provided by this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy provided by general law or by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. (Ord. No. 15-10, § 1, 12-8-15)

CD66:4.3
devices and subtracting such amount, wholly, from the total real property tax due on the real property to which such solar energy equipment, facilities or devices are attached.

Sec. 74-195. Water supply emergencies; mandatory restrictions; conservation measures; violations.
During the continued existence of climatic, hydrological and other extraordinary conditions the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Town of Pearisburg may require that certain uses of water, not essential to public health, safety and welfare, be reduced, restricted or curtailed. As the shortage of raw or potable water becomes increasingly more critical, conservation measures may become increasingly strict to further reduce consumption or curtail nonessential water use.
Under Code of Virginia, § 15.2-924, the governing body of the locality is authorized to adopt an ordinance restricting the use of water by the citizens of such locality for the duration of such emergency or for a period of time necessary to prevent the occurrence of a water supply emergency.
The Giles County Public Service Authority routinely monitors water supplies. The Executive Director of the Giles County PSA will notify the governing body of Pearisburg when water supply conditions approach or pass the indicators developed in the New River Valley's Regional Water Supply Plan. At such time as the governing body is informed of an imminent water supply emergency, it will authorize the town manager to manage said water supply emergency.
Upon declaration of a water emergency, the town manager official shall immediately post a written notice of the emergency at the front door of the administration building and shall place a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which such emergency has been declared. Such notice shall be published in the Virginian Leader and the New River section of the Roanoke Times and shall further be included in the water bills rendered to each customer of the town.
The town manager will coordinate with the GCPSA executive director to notify customers of necessary voluntary or mandatory water use restrictions, as outlined in the New River Valley's Regional Water Supply Plan. In exercising this discretionary authority, the PSA executive director and town manager shall give due consideration to water levels, available/usable storage on hand, draw down rates, and the projected supply capability, system purification and pumping capacity, daily water consumption and consumption projections of the system's customers, prevailing and forecast weather conditions, fire service requirements, pipeline conditions including breakages, stoppages and leaks, supplementary source data, estimates of minimum essential supplied to preserve public health and safety and such other data pertinent to the past, current and projected water demands.

25-03-050 Road Classification. The classification system groups roads into
three basic categories identified as arterial, with two subclasses of
“principal” and “minor”, with the primary function to provide through
movement of traffic; collector, with the function of supplying a
combination of through movement and access to property; and
Page 7
local, with the primary function of providing access to property and
are further defined as follows:
a. Principal Arterials: major highways of regional and statewide
significance intended to serve through traffic where access to
the highway is carefully controlled.
b. Minor Arterials: Minor arterials interconnect with and augment
the principal arterial system. Minor arterials distribute traffic to
smaller geographic areas providing service between and within
communities.
c. Collector Roads: Collectors provide land access service and
traffic circulation within residential, commercial, and industrial
areas. The collector system distributes trips from the arterials
through the area to the ultimate destination. Collector Roads
also collect traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods
and channel it into the arterial system.
d. Limited Access Highways: are the primary and interstate limited
access highways, which provide inter-regional connections.
e. Local Roads: are streets that transport general residential traffic.
They do not carry the same volumes that are recorded on
higher-level streets. These roads should be safe for
pedestrians. These roads connect to collectors to provide
access to other areas of the Town and then further to Arterials
and further to Limited Access Highways.
f. Service Roads: are limited use roads that provide access to
non-residential development. The intent of this road is to limit
access directly onto a collector or arterial.
25-03-051 Road, Dead-End. See: “Road Type”
25-03-052 Road Designation. Legal presumption of the Road defined as the
following:
a. Public Road: Any highway, street, avenue, boulevard, road,
lane, alley or public way that is maintained by either a Virginia
Municipality or the Virginia Department of Transportation and
which provides unrestricted ingress and egress.
b. Private Road: Any and all streets that are not constructed to
meet the standards necessary for inclusion in the system of
state highways. All such private roads and streets shall be
privately maintained and will not be eligible for acceptance into
the system of state highways unless improved to then current
Department of Transportation standards with funds other than
Page 8
those appropriated by the General Assembly and allocated by
the Commonwealth Transportation Board.
25-03-053 Road, Right-of-Way Width. The distance between property lines
measured at right angles to the center line of the public road.
25-03-054 Road Type. Features defining the roadway by the physical
attributes defined as the following:
a. Alley: The public or private Right-of-Way primarily designed to
serve as secondary access to the side or rear of those
properties whose principal frontage is on some other public
road.
b. Cul-De-Sac: A local public road with only one outlet and having
an appropriate terminal for the safe and convenient reversal of
traffic movement. See: “Road Type”
c. Dead-End Road: A road or a portion of a street with only one
(1) vehicular-traffic outlet.
d. Perimeter Public Road: Any existing public road to which the
parcel of land to be subdivided abuts on only one (1) side.
e. Private court: A privately owned vehicular Right-of-Way in
multifamily residential or commercial developments designated
for ingress, egress and parking.
25-03-055 Sale or Lease. Any immediate or future transfer of ownership or
any possessory interest in land, including contract of sale, lease,
devise, intestate succession, or transfer of an interest in a
subdivision or part thereof, whether by metes and bounds, deed,

25-06 Design Standards
25-06-01 Lot Requirements
25-06-01-01 LOT SHAPE. The lot arrangement, design, and shape shall be
such that lots will provide satisfactory and desirable sites for
buildings, and be properly related to the topography, and conform
to the requirements of these regulations. Lots shall not contain
peculiarly shaped elongations solely to provide necessary square
footage by adding area which would be unusable for normal
purposes, as determined by the Agent, Planning Commission,
and/or the Town Council.
25-06-01-02 Lot Size. The minimum lot size shall be in accordance with the lot
requirement for the zoning district in which the subdivision is
located as prescribed in the Town of Pearisburg Zoning Ordinance
25-06-01-03 Lot Shall Abut on a Street. Each lot shall abut on a street dedicated
by the subdivision plat, or an existing publicly dedicated street, or
on a street which has become public by right of use except as
provided by this ordinance. If the existing street right of way does
not meet the Virginia Department of Transportation Subdivision
Street Requirements, the developer shall make provisions in the
deeds to the lots for all buildings to be so constructed as to permit
the widening by dedication of said roads or street to the current
Virginia Department of Transportation requirements for right of way
for public streets.
25-06-01-04 Lot Side Lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles, or radial to the street line.
25-06-01-05 Lots must be solely in the Town of Pearisburg. No Lot Platted under
the provisions of this ordinance shall be divided by the Municipal or
County Boundary Line.
25-06-01-06 Remnants. Land subject to flooding, land deemed to be
topographically unsuitable for residential occupancy and all
remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing a
tract must be added to adjacent lots, or become the property of a
homeowners association rather than allowed to remain as unusable
parcels, to be used in the form of an Outlot.
25-06-01-07 Setbacks. Setback requirements shall be shown clearly upon the
preliminary and final plat. Minimum setback requirements shall be
Page 14
those required in the Town of Pearisburg Zoning Ordinance for the
zoning district in which the lot is located. For the purposes of
setback requirements, lots shall be deemed to front on the street or
right of way which provides access to the lot.
25-06-02 Blocks
25-06-02-01 Block Formation. All Blocks shall be designed specifically for the
land uses corresponding to the areas within the subdivision that are
proposed, with adequate space for off street parking and delivery if
deemed necessary by the agent.

hundred (1200) feet, and the minimum length of blocks upon which
lots have frontage shall be three hundred (300) feet.
25-06-02-03 Block Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots
of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets, unless
prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in
which case the agent may approve a single tier of lots of minimum
depth.
25-06-02-04 Block Orientation. Where a proposed subdivision adjoins an arterial
road, and/or where a potential traffic hazard would be created if
driveways serving such subdivisions lots were to intersect such
thoroughfare, the Town may require that the greater dimension of
the block shall front or back upon such thoroughfare to avoid
unnecessary ingress or egress.
25-06-03 Streets
25-06-03-01 Street Design and Standards. All public streets shall be constructed
in accordance with current Virginia Department of Transportation
guidelines. Private Streets should be utilized in Town home
developments only with the exception of private courts.
For the purposes of this section, public access shall be deemed to
exist when a lot abuts (as described in Section 25-06-01-03) on an
existing street maintained by either the Town of Pearisburg or the
Virginia Department of Transportation.
25-06-03-02 For all Standard Subdivisions (divisions of land into two or more
lots, any one of which contains an area of less than five (5) acres)
all streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) Subdivision Street

03-01 Plats proposing private streets shall clearly provide rights-ofway
width as set forth in the Virginia Department of Transportation
Subdivision Street Requirements in effect at the time of subdivision
approval which include easements for public utilities and provide
rights of access to public utilities without further approval or
conveyance. Plats and other documents used to describe or
transfer ownership of such parcels served by private streets shall
clearly inform the purchaser of his responsibilities for construction,
reconstruction, and maintenance of streets within the development.
The following statement shall be included on each plat containing a
private street and on the deed to each lot in such a subdivision:
“The streets in this subdivision do not meet the standards
necessary for inclusion in the system of state highways and
will not be maintained by the Department of Transportation
or the Town of Pearisburg and are not eligible for rural
addition funds or any other funds appropriated by the
General Assembly and allocated by the Commonwealth
Transportation Board. Prior to any future request for their
addition to the state highway system they shall be
constructed in full compliance with Virginia Department of
Transportation requirements in effect at that time.”
All such documents shall be submitted to the subdivision agent for
approval prior to recordation.
25-06-03-05 For Family Subdivisions, all lots shall have public or private access
as set forth in 25-06-03-02, except that only twenty (20) foot rights
of way are required for private access, if deemed appropriate by the
agent. While not required, careful consideration should be given to
the right of way width specified in the Virginia Department of
Transportation Subdivision Street Requirements. All other
provisions of 25-06-03 and 25-06-03-01 shall apply. Lots divided
under the Family Subdivision provisions of this ordinance (Section
25-03-063 b and 25-06-03-01) may not be further divided, even for
purposes of sale or gift to another family member, unless access is
provided in full compliance with Section 25-06-03-01.
Page 16
25-06-03-06 For any subdivision proposing public streets or roads, the plat shall
include a signature block for the Virginia Department of
Transportation (VDOT). The signature block shall include the
following language: “The streets depicted on this plat satisfy the
requirements of VDOT’s current Subdivision Street Requirements
(SSRs). When designed and built accordingly and all other
provisions of the SSRs are satisfied, VDOT will accept jurisdiction
over the streets at the request of the local governing body. VDOT
responsibility to maintain drainage easements outside of the public
right of way shall only be to the degree required to protect public
transportation interests.”
25-06-03-07 Curb and Gutter. All public streets should have curb and gutter,
whether newly created, or extensions of existing streets. In the
event Curb and Gutter cannot be utilized alternatives with regard to
Stormwater Management, The Planning Commission can consider
other viable design options with justification provided by the
Developer in the form of Engineering studies or other applicable
data.

standards in street design.
25-06-03-10 Street Alignment and Layout. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of existing
streets in adjoining areas. The street arrangement must be such as
to cause no unnecessary hardship to owners of adjoining property
when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it. Where, in the opinion of the Town, it is desirable to
provide for street access adjoining property, proposed streets shall
be extended by dedication to the boundary line of such property.
Half streets along the boundary of land proposed for subdivision
are not permitted. Wherever possible, streets should intersect at
right angles. In all hillside areas, streets running with contours shall
be required to intersect at angles of not less than sixty (60)
degrees, unless approved by the Agent.

dedicate land for parks or playgrounds, exclusive of street and
drainage without reimbursement by the Town. Where land is
Page 18
required in excess of this amount, the reimbursement by the Town
shall be based on a proportionate share of the: 1) cost of raw land;
2) cost of improvements, including interests or investments; 3)
development costs; plus 4) not more than ten (10) percent profit on
the total of such costs;
Developers shall not be required to reserve land for public

egress, public access, structures necessary to ensure stability of
critical slopes, or for storm water management facilities, except on
a reimbursement basis. They shall be reimbursed by the Town or
agency requiring the land. The amount of reimbursement shall be
determined as previously stated. They shall not be required to hold
land longer than eighteen (18) months following the recording of the
plat for such purchase. If the land is not purchased within the said
eighteen (18) months, it may be sold as lots for the same purposes
for which the subdivision was platted. To facilitate such possible
eventual sale of reserved land as separate lots, the Developer shall
show on the final plat, by dotted lines and dotted numbers, the area
and dimensions of lots to be created within the boundaries of any
such reserved land, and may sell such lots, after the expiration date
of the reservation, by lot number, without filing an amended plat.
25-06-05-02 Land to be Divisible. The Agent and/or Planning Commission shall
make certain that lands so reserved are divisible in the same

25-08-04 Preliminary Plat Procedure. The Agent and/or Planning
Commission shall discuss the preliminary plat with the Developer in
order to determine whether or not the preliminary plat generally

Page 24
may be by formal letter or by legible markings on a copy of the
preliminary plat, concerning any additional data that may be
required, the character and extent of public improvements that will
have to be made, and notice of the performance guaranty which will
be required to be submitted as a prerequisite to approval of the final
subdivision plat. In determining the cost of required improvements
and the amount of the performance guaranty, the Agent shall
require a bona fide estimate of the cost of improvements to be
furnished by the Developer. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2259)
25-08-05 Final Plat not Guaranteed. Approval by the Agent and/or the
Planning Commission of the preliminary plat does not constitute
guarantee of approval of the final plat.
25-08-06 Six Month Limit on Approvals. The Developer shall have not more
than six (6) months after the date of approval of the preliminary plat
to file a final subdivision plat in accordance with this section with
the Agent. Failure to do so shall make preliminary approval null
and void. The Agent may, on written request by the Developer,
grant an extension of this time limit. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2260)

The Developer shall submit six (6) copies of the plat, one of which shall be
reduced to eleven inches by seventeen inches. The subdivision plats submitted
for final approval by the Town and subsequent recording shall be clearly and
legibly drawn in ink upon stable based material at an appropriate engineering
scale, i.e. one hundred (100) feet to the inch, on sheets measuring no larger than
18 inches by 24 inches and no smaller than 11 inches by 17 inches in size. Plats
shall further comply with all of the requirements imposed by law for recordation
standards. Current recordation standards may be obtained from the Clerk of the
Circuit Court. When a subdivision cannot be platted on sheets of this size, it is
suggested that it be platted in sections, numbering the sections numerically, as
Section 1, 2, etc., of subdivision.(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2259)
25-09-01 Final Plat Requirements. The Final Plat shall contain at least the
following information:
a. Name of subdivision, community, state, owner, north
point, scale of drawing, and number of sheets. If shown on
more than several sheets join. A space containing the
Certificate of Approval shall be provided for the use of the

two (2) adjacent corners of the subdivision are shown.
d. A statement to the effect that the subdivision as it appears
on this plat is with the free consent and in accordance with
the desires of the owners, proprietors, and trustees, if any,
which shall be signed by the owners, proprietors, and
trustees, if any, and shall be duly acknowledged before
some officer authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds
on the form.
e. When the subdivision consists of land acquired from more
than one source of title, the outlines of the various tracts
shall be indicated by dashed lines, and identification of the
respective tracts shall be placed on the plat.
f. The accurate location and dimensions by bearings and
distances with all curve data on all lots and street lines or
center lines of streets; boundaries of all proposed or existing
easements; all existing public and private streets, their
names, numbers, and widths; water courses and their
names, names of owners and their property lines, both within
the boundary of the subdivision and adjoining said
boundaries.
g. Tax Parcel Identification number (s) for the parcel (s)
being subdivided.
h. The data of all curves along the street frontages shall be
shown in detail at the curve or in a curve data table
containing the following: Delta, radius, arc, tangent, chord,
and chord bearings.
i. Location of Lots indicating street and Lot identification
numbers.
25-09-02 Considerations for the Final Plat. The Agent, Planning Commission
or Town Council shall act on proposed final plats within sixty (60)
days after it has been officially submitted for approval by either
Page 26
approving or disapproving such plat in writing, and giving with the
latter specific reasons therefore. The specific reasons for
disapproval may be contained in a separate document or may be
written on the plat itself, and shall relate in general terms such
modifications or corrections as will permit approval of the plat.
(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2259)
25-09-03 After Sixty Day Consideration. If the Agent, Planning Commission
or Town Council fails to act on the proposed plat within sixty (60)
days after it has been officially submitted for approval, the
Developer, after ten (10) days written notice to the Town may
petition the Circuit Court to decide whether the plat should or
should not be approved. The Court shall hear the matter and make
and enter such order with respect thereto as it deems proper.
(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2260)
25-09-04 Appeals To Circuit Court. If the Town Council disapproves a plat
and the Developer contends that such disapproval was not properly
based on the Ordinance applicable thereto, or was arbitrary or
capricious, the Developer may appeal to the Circuit Court having
jurisdiction of such land, and the Court shall hear and determine the
case as soon as possible, provided that his appeal is filed with the
Circuit Court within sixty (60) days of the date of disapproval by the
Town Council. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2259)
25-09-05 Recordation of Final Plat Required. The Developer shall have not
more than six (6) months after receiving final approval to file the
subdivision plat for recordation. If a plat is not filed for recordation
within the time limit such approval shall be withdrawn and the plat
marked void and returned. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2241)
25-09-06 Additional Data Required. Upon recordation of the final plat, the
Developer shall submit or cause to be submitted, the approved final
plat in digital format for use by the Town of Pearisburg in a format
easily accessible by the Town.
25-09-07 Draw and Certify. Every subdivision plat which is intended for
recording shall be prepared by a certified engineer or licensed Land
Surveyor, who shall endorse upon each plat a certificate signed by
said professional, setting forth the source of the description the land
to be subdivided and the place of record of the last instrument in
the chain of title; when the plat is of land acquired from more than
one ownership, the outlines of the tracts shall be indicated upon
such plat (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2262)
Page 27
25-09-08 Owners Statement. Every such plat, or deed of dedication to which
the plat is attached, shall contain in addition to the professional
engineer's or licensed land surveyor's certificate a statement as
follows: "The platting or dedication of the following described land
(here insert a correct description of the land subdivided) is with the
free consent and in accordance with the desire of the undersigned
owners, proprietors, and trustees, if any". The statement shall be
signed by such persons and duly acknowledged before some
officer authorized to take acknowledgement of deeds. When thus
executed and acknowledged, the plat, subject to the provisions
herein, shall be filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of court
where deeds are admitted to record for the lands contained in the
plat, and indexed in the general index to deeds under the names of
the owners of lands signing such statement, and under the name of
the subdivision. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2264)
25-10 Improvements and Guarantees
25-10-01 Improvements Accepted and Constructed. Before the acceptance
of improvements and release of surety by the Town Council, the
Agent, or the Planning Commission, all applicants shall be required
to complete all of the public roads, curbs, gutters, sidewalks,
drainage, sewer, water facilities, or other improvements constructed
for public use and financed in whole or part or in part by private
funds and to provide as built drawings of the improvements
constructed.
25-10-02 Performance Guarantee in lieu of Construction. The Planning
Commission and Town Council at their discretion may waive the
requirements for complete construction provided the owner or
developer furnish the Town a performance guarantee for
construction in the amount of the estimated cost of the construction
or surety such as: a personal, corporate, or property bond; certified
check, letter of credit, cash escrow, or other guaranteed instrument
acceptable to the Town. The Planning Commission and the Town
Council shall have the full authority to determine the amount and
sufficiency of the performance guarantee and the surety for such
guarantee. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2241)
25-10-03 Periodic Release of Performance Guarantee. The developer may
request periodic release of the performance guarantee upon
completion of part or all of any facilities required to be constructed,
unless the governing body or its designated administrative agency
notifies said developer in writing of non-receipt of approval by
applicable state agency, or of any specified defects or deficiencies
Page 28
in construction and suggested corrective measure prior to
expiration of the thirty-day period.
If action is not taken by the governing body or administrative
agency within the time specified above, the request shall be
deemed approved, and a partial release granted until after
expiration of such thirty-day period and there is an additional
request in writing sent by certified mail return receipt to the chief
administrative officer of such governing body. The governing body
or its designated administrative agency shall act within ten working
days of receipt of the request; then if no action is taken the request
shall be deemed approved and final release granted to the
developer.
The Town Council shall not refuse to make a periodic partial or final
release of a bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance
guarantee for any reason not directly related to the specified
defects or deficiencies in construction of the facilities covered by
said bond, escrow, letter of credit or other performance guarantee.
(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2245)
25-10-04 Limits on Release. The governing body or its designated
administrative agency shall be required to make periodic partial
releases of such bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other
performance guarantee in a cumulative amount equal to no less
than eighty percent of the original amount for which the bond,
escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee was taken,
based upon the percentage of facilities completed and approved by
the governing body, local administrative agency, or state agency
having jurisdiction.
Periodic partial releases may not occur before the completion of at
least thirty percent of the facilities covered by any bond, escrow,
letter of credit, or other performance guarantee, or after completion
of more than eighty percent of said facilities. The governing body
or administrative agency shall not be required to execute more than
three periodic partial releases in any twelve-month period. Upon
final completion and acceptance of said facilities, the governing
body or administrative agency shall release any remaining bond,
escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee to the
developer. For the purpose of final release the term "acceptance"
is deemed to mean: when said public facility is accepted by and
taken over for operation and maintenance by the state agency,
local government department or agency, or other public authority
Page 29
which is responsible for maintaining and for operating such facility
upon acceptance. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2245)
25-10-05 Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements required by the Planning
Commission and shall maintain same for the period specified by the
Planning Commission. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the local
government separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which
bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be property
constructed, maintained, and removed.
25-10-06 Failure to Complete Improvements. For subdivisions
for which no performance bond has been posted, if the
improvements are not completed within the period specified by the
Planning Commission in the resolution approving the plat, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a
performance bond has been posted and required improvements
have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond,
the local government may thereupon declare the bond to be in
default and require that all the improvements be installed,
regardless of the extent of the building development at that time the
bond is declared to be in default. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2245)
25-10-07 Previous Acceptance of Dedicated Facilities. Should the Town have
accepted the dedication of a road for public use and such road is
not acceptable for inclusion in the State Highway System due to
factors other than its quality of construction, the Town may require
the developer to furnish a maintenance and indemnifying bond or
letter of credit with surety satisfactory to the Town, in an amount
sufficient for, and conditioned upon, the maintenance of such road
until such time as it is accepted into the State Highway System.
25-11 Lot Line Revisions
A lot line on an existing parcel may be revised as long as the revision will not be
in conflict with any provisions of this ordinance. The portion of land sold shall
become a part of the adjoining tract. If the owner or the owner of the adjoining
tract whose boundaries are adjusted decides to sell such tract, the owner must
either sell the entire tract, including the area within the adjusted boundary, or fully
comply with the provisions of the subdivision ordinance in effect at the time of the
proposed conveyance, the same as if the boundary adjustment had never
occurred. For conveyance made under this section, the deed of conveyance shall
contain the following language:
Page 30
"This conveyance is made in compliance with the Lotline Revision
provisions of the Town of Pearisburg Subdivision Ordinance
(Section 25-11 or its replacement). For the purposes of such
ordinance, the tract herein conveyed becomes a part of that certain
tract of real estate described in Deed Book at page .
Any future conveyance of this tract must comply fully with the
provisions of the Town of Pearisburg Subdivision Ordinance in
effect at the time of such future sale."
Such revision shall not result in the creation of a nonconforming lot.
(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2275)
25-12 Vacation of Plat
A plat may be vacated by Ordinance of the Town Council on motion of one of it
members, or on application of any interested person. Such Ordinance shall not
be adopted until after notice has been given as required by the Code of Virginia.
Said notice shall clearly describe the plat or portion thereof to be vacated and
state the time and place of the meeting of the Town Council at which the
adoption of the Ordinance is to be considered. An appeal from the adoption of
the Ordinance may be filed within thirty days with the Circuit Court having
jurisdiction of the land shown on the plat or part thereof to be vacated. Upon
such appeal, the court may nullify the Ordinance if it finds that the owner of any
lot shown on the plat will be irreparably damaged. If no appeal from the adoption
of the Ordinance is filed within the time provided or if the Ordinance is upheld on
appeal, a certified copy of the Ordinance of vacation shall be recorded in the
clerk's office of the court in which the plat is recorded.
25-12-01 Any such plat recorded, or part thereof, may be vacated with the
consent of the governing body, or its authorized Agent, of the Town
of Pearisburg where the land lies, by the owners, proprietors and
trustees, if any, who signed the statement required by 25-09-07 at
any time before the sale of any lot therein by a written instrument,
declaring the same to be vacated, duly executed, acknowledged or
proved and recorded in the same clerk's office wherein the plat to
be vacated is recorded and the execution and recordation of such
writing shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording
of the plat so vacated and to divest all public rights in, and to
reinvest such owners, proprietors and trustees, if any, with the title
to the streets, alleys, easements for public passage and other
public areas laid out or described in such plat. (Code of Virginia §
15.2-2271)
25-12-02 In cases where any lot has been sold, the plat or part thereof may
be vacated according to either of the following methods:
Page 31
(a) By instrument in writing agreeing to said vacation signed by
all the owners of lots shown on said plat and also signed on
behalf of the governing body in which the land shown on the
plat or part thereof to be vacated lies for the purpose of
showing the approval of such vacation by the governing
body. The word "owners" shall not include lien creditors
except those whose debts are secured by a recorded deed
of trust or mortgage and shall not include any consort of an
owner. The instrument of vacation shall be acknowledged in
the manner of a deed and filed for record in the clerk's office
of any court in which said plat is recorded.
(b) By ordinance of the governing body in which the land shown
on the plat or part thereof to be vacated lies on motion of
one of its members or on application of any interested
person. Such ordinance shall not be adopted until after
notice has been given as required by Code of Virginia. Said
notice shall clearly describe the plat or portion thereof to be
vacated and state the time and place of the meeting of the
governing body at which the adoption of the ordinance will
be voted upon. Any person may appear at said meeting for
the purpose of objecting to the adoption of the ordinance.
An appeal from the adoption of the ordinance may be filed
within thirty days with the circuit court having jurisdiction of
the land shown on the plat or part thereof to be vacated.
Upon such appeal the court may nullify the ordinance if it
finds that the owner of any lot shown on the plat will be
irreparably damaged. If no appeal from the adoption of the
ordinance is filed within the time above provided or if the
ordinance is upheld on appeal, a certified copy of the
ordinance of vacation may be recorded in the clerk's office of
any court in which the plat is recorded
(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2272)
25-13 Exceptions
Where the Developer can show that a provision of these standards would cause
unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where because of topographical
or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the opinion of the Town of Pearisburg a
departure may be made without destroying the intent of such provisions, the
Agent may authorize an exception. Any exception thus authorized is to be stated
in writing in the report of the Agent with the reasoning, on which the departure
was justified, set forth. No exception to this Ordinance may be granted which is
opposed in writing by the Town or Highway Engineer/Resident Advisor or Health
Official, unless the opposition is found by the Planning Commission and the
Town Council to be arbitrary and capricious.
Page 32
25-14 Advertising Standards
In advertising lots for sale the developer, subdivider, or subdivider's agent shall
include the following points:
(a) A Developer, when advertising a subdivided tract of land for sale,
shall be specific as to whether or not officially approved water and
sewage facilities are available.

25-15 Variances
Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardship or practical
difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or the
purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative
proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations; and further provided the Planning Commission shall not
approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
(a) The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to public
safety, health, or welfare or injuries to other property as located;
(b) The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are
not applicable generally to other property.
(c) Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from
a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations are
carried out;
(d) The variances will not in any manner vary the provision of the
Page 33
Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or Official Map.
(Code of Virginia § 15.2-2242)
25-15-01 Conditions. In approving variances, the Planning Commission may
require such conditions and will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of
these regulations.
25-15-02 Procedure. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the Developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed for the consideration of the Planning Commission. The petition
shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts
relied upon by the petitioner.
25-16 Effectual Clauses
25-16-01 Penalties. Any person violating the foregoing provisions of this
section shall be subject to a fine or not more than five hundred
dollars ($500) for each lot or parcel of land so subdivided or
transferred or sold; and the description of such lot or parcel by
metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document
used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the
transaction from such penalties or from the remedies herein
provided. Each day of violation shall be deemed a separate
offense.
25-16-02 Validity. Should any article, section, subsection or provision of this
subdivision ordinance be declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not
affect the validity or constitutionality of this subdivision ordinance as
a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be
invalid or unconstitutional.
25-16-03 Repeal. All ordinances or portions of ordinances in conflict with this
ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of their conflict.
25-16-04 Amendment. This ordinance may be amended in whole or in part
by the governing body provided that any such amendment shall
either originate with or be submitted to the Planning Commission
for recommendation; and further provided that no such amendment
shall be adopted without a public hearing having been held by the
governing body. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall
have been given at least once a week for two weeks, and the last
notice at least six (6) days prior to the hearing.
Page 34

24-705-1	HOME OCCUPATIONS

24-706-00 - SIGNS
24-706-01- Findings, purpose and intent; interpretation.
24-706-01-01- Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose  of this aiticle is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the vai·ious neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and haimonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas, and the safety and welfare of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This  aiticle allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and pmpose of all signs. This aiticle shall be inte1preted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guai·antee of free speech. If any provision of this article is found by a comt of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this a1ticle which can be given effect without the invalid provision.

24-706-1-2	Signs not expressly permitted as being allowed by right or by special use permit under this article, by specific requirements in another portion of this chapter, or otherwise expressly allowed by the Pearisburg Town Council or Board of Zoning Appeals are forbidden.

24-706-1-3	A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein shall be deemed to be an integral but access01y and subordinate pait of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this aiticle is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they ai·e appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection 24- 706-01-01(01) of this section.

24-706-1-4	These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and ai·chitecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pe1tain, are not distracting

83
 
to  motorists,  and  are consh·ucted  and maintained  in a structurally  sound and attractive condition.

24-706-1-5	These regulations distinguish between portions of the Town designed for primarily vehicular access and portions of the Town designed for primarily pedestrian access.

24-706-1-6	These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the Town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above.

24-706-1-7	These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs.


24-706-2	- Definitions.

24-706-2-1	A-Frame sign means a two-faced sign with supports that are connected at the top and separated at the base, f01ming an "A" shape not more than four feet high. These are also refeued to as "sandwich board" signs. They are included in the term "portable sign."

24-806-2	To authorize upon original application in specific cases such variance from the terms of the Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary hardship; provided that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done as follows:







24-806-2-1	When a property owner can show that this property was acquired in good faith, and that by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance, or that by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or conditions of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of the Ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property; or that the Board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or


119
 
convenience sought by the applicant, provided that all variances shall be in hatmony with the intended spirit and purpose of the Ordinance;



24-806-2-2	No Such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds:
24-806-02-02-01	The strict application of the Ordinance would produce undue hardship; 24-806-02-02-02	such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the satne
zoning district and the satne vicinity;

24-806-02-02-03		That the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and the chai·acter of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance;

24-806-2-3	No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and hearing as required by§  15-2-2204 of the Code of Virginia 1950, as amended;

24-806-2-4	No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the prope1ty is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the Ordinance;

24-806-2-5	In authorizing a variance, the Board may impose such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed structure for use as it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to insure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with.

local, with the primary function of providing access to property and are further defined as follows:

a.	Principal Arterials: major highways of regional and statewide significance intended to serve through traffic where access to the highway is carefully controlled.

b.	Minor Arterials: Minor arterials interconnect with and augment the principal arterial system. Minor arterials distribute traffic to smaller geographic areas providing service between and within communities.

25-5-6	SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE (See Appendix A)

25-6	Design Standards

25-6-1	Lot Requirements

25-6-1-1	LOT SHAPE. The lot arrangement, design, and shape shall be such that lots will provide satisfactory and desirable sites for buildings, and be properly related to the topography, and conform to the requirements of these regulations. Lots shall not contain peculiarly shaped elongations solely to provide necessary square footage by adding area which would be unusable for normal purposes, as determined by the Agent, Planning Commission, and/or the Town Council.

25-6-1-2	Lot Size. The minimum lot size shall be in accordance with the lot requirement for the zoning district in which the subdivision is located as prescribed in the Town of Pearisburg Zoning Ordinance

25-6-1-3	Lot Shall Abut on a Street. Each lot shall abut on a street dedicated by the subdivision plat, or an existing publicly dedicated street, or on a street which has become public by right of use except as provided by this ordinance. If the existing street right of way does not meet the Virginia Department of Transportation Subdivision Street Requirements, the developer shall make provisions in the deeds to the lots for all buildings to be so constructed as to permit the widening by dedication of said roads or street to the current Virginia Department of Transportation requirements for right of way for public streets.

25-6-1-4	Lot Side Lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles, or radial to the street line.

25-6-1-6	Remnants. Land subject to flooding, land deemed to be topographically	unsuitable for residential occupancy and all remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing a tract must be added to adjacent lots, or become the property of a homeowners association rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels, to be used in the form of an Outlot.

25-6-1-7	Setbacks. Setback requirements shall be shown clearly upon the preliminary and   final plat. Minimum setback requirements shall be
 
those required in the Town of Pearisburg Zoning Ordinance for the zoning district in which the lot is located. For the purposes of setback requirements, lots shall be deemed to front on the street or right of way which provides access to the lot.

25-6-2	Blocks

25-6-2-1	Block Formation. All Blocks shall be designed specifically for the land uses corresponding to the areas within the subdivision that are proposed, with adequate space for off street parking and delivery if deemed necessary by the agent.

25-6-2-4	Block Orientation. Where a proposed subdivision adjoins an arterial road, and/or where a potential traffic hazard would be created if driveways serving such subdivisions lots were to intersect such thoroughfare, the Town may require that the greater dimension of the block shall front or back upon such thoroughfare to avoid unnecessary ingress or egress.

25-6-3	Streets

25-6-3-1	Street Design and Standards. All public streets shall be constructed in accordance with current Virginia Department of Transportation guidelines. Private Streets should be utilized in Town home developments only with the exception of private courts.

For the purposes of this section, public access shall be deemed to exist when a lot abuts (as described in Section 25-06-01-03) on an existing street maintained by either the Town of Pearisburg or the Virginia Department of Transportation.

25-6-3-2	For all Standard Subdivisions (divisions of land into two or more lots, any one of which contains an area of less than five (5) acres) all streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) Subdivision Street
 
Requirements and Sections 211 and 315 of VDOT’s Road and Bridge Specifications in accordance with Urban Street Standards.

For all subdivisions pursuant to Section 25-06-03-01 and all Large Lot Subdivisions pursuant to Section 25-06-03-06, access may be proposed which is either public or private. If public streets are proposed, they must meet the standards specified in Section 25-06- 03-01 Plats proposing private streets shall clearly provide rights-of- way width as set forth in the Virginia Department of Transportation Subdivision Street Requirements in effect at the time of subdivision approval which include easements for public utilities and provide rights of access to public utilities without further approval or conveyance.

The following statement shall be included on each plat containing a private street and on the deed to each lot in such a subdivision:

“The streets in this subdivision do not meet the standards necessary for inclusion in the system of state highways and will not be maintained by the Department of Transportation or the Town of Pearisburg and are not eligible for rural addition funds or any other funds appropriated by the General Assembly and allocated by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. Prior to any future request for their addition to the state highway system they shall be constructed in full compliance with Virginia Department of Transportation requirements in effect at that time.”

All such documents shall be submitted to the subdivision agent for approval prior to recordation.

25-6-3-5	For Family Subdivisions, all lots shall have public or private access as set forth in 25-06-03-02, except that only twenty (20) foot rights of way are required for private access, if deemed appropriate by the agent.

25-6-5-1	Reimbursement Required. Developers shall not be required to dedicate land for parks or playgrounds, exclusive of street and drainage  without  reimbursement  by  the  Town.    Where  land  is
 
required in excess of this amount, the reimbursement by the Town shall be based on a proportionate share of the:  1) cost of raw land;
2) cost of improvements, including interests or investments; 3) development costs; plus 4) not more than ten (10) percent profit on the total of such costs;

Developers shall not be required to reserve land for public purposes other than streets, drainage, sidewalk, sewer system, or water systems or other site improvements for vehicular ingress and egress, public access, structures necessary to ensure stability of critical slopes, or for storm water management facilities, except on a reimbursement basis. They shall be reimbursed by the Town or agency requiring the land. The amount of reimbursement shall be determined as previously stated. They shall not be required to hold land longer than eighteen (18) months following the recording of the plat for such purchase. If the land is not purchased within the said eighteen (18) months, it may be sold as lots for the same purposes for which the subdivision was platted. To facilitate such possible eventual sale of reserved land as separate lots, the Developer shall show on the final plat, by dotted lines and dotted numbers, the area and dimensions of lots to be created within the boundaries of any such reserved land, and may sell such lots, after the expiration date of the reservation, by lot number, without filing an amended plat.

25-6-5-2	Land to be Divisible. The Agent and/or Planning Commission shall make certain that lands so reserved are divisible in the same manner as the remainder of the subdivision so that the Developer will not be required to reserve an unusable portion of his subdivision.

The Town Council shall not refuse to make a periodic partial or final release of a bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee for any reason not directly related to the specified defects or deficiencies in construction of the facilities covered by said bond, escrow, letter of credit or other performance guarantee. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2245)



25-10-4	Limits on Release. The governing body or its designated administrative agency shall be required to make periodic partial releases	of such bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee in a cumulative amount equal to no less than eighty percent of the original amount for which the bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee was taken, based upon the percentage of facilities completed and approved by the governing body, local administrative agency, or state agency having jurisdiction.

(a)	The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to public safety, health, or welfare or injuries to other property as located;

(b)	The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property.

(d)	The variances will not in any manner vary the provision of the
 
Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, or Official Map. (Code of Virginia § 15.2-2242)
