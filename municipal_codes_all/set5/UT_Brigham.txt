City Council.
A. Meeting Procedures. The City shall comply with all required procedures contained in the Utah
Code and as outlined in Section 2.03 of the City Code as updated. The City Council does not formally
adopt Robert’s Rules of Order. City Council meeting agenda items will be conducted by introducing the
item and having a discussion by the council members on the item. After sufficient discussion a motion
and a second will be required for the council to vote. If no second to a motion is received then the motion
becomes invalid and another motion can be considered. Other meeting procedures are outlined below in
this section of the City Code. If any rule is in conflict with any provision of Utah State Code governing
meeting procedures for the City Council, the City Council shall follow the provision of the Utah State
Code. Unless otherwise stated in State Code, three votes are required to approve an item or any action.
B. Public Comment. Public Comment may be listed on the agenda of the City Council and may
be limited to residents of Brigham City. The public comment portion of the meeting shall be limited to the
public speaking to the Council on any item listed or not listed on the agenda. Members of the public shall
be free to express any idea, question or viewpoint without limitation except for time and the manner of the
presentation. Individual members of the public shall be limited to three (3) minutes time. The Chair of the
meeting shall ensure that the public comment is civil and orderly. Personal attacks made publicly toward
any person or City employee are not allowed. Speakers are encouraged to bring their complaints
regarding employee performance through the supervisory chain of command in accordance with the
City’s Personnel Policies. The Chair shall use its best efforts to allow the free expression of the public and
keep the meeting in order. Councilmembers should not interrupt, argue with, or otherwise interfere with
2 Section added with Ordinance No. 11-32, 12/01/11.
Page 2-5
any comment by a member of the public. The Mayor and City Council may ask clarifying questions of the
member of the public making a presentation and other members of the public may ask clarifying
questions of the presenter at the discretion of the Chair.
C. Public Participation in Meeting. Other than at a required public hearing and the public
comment portion of the meeting, members of the public shall not be allowed to participate in the meeting
unless they are on the agenda or requested to present to the Council by the Chair of the meeting or a
member of the council. Any member of the public interrupting City Council proceedings, approaching the
Council without permission, otherwise creating a disturbance, or failing to abide by the rules of procedure
in addressing City Council, shall be deemed to have disrupted a public meeting and, at the direction of
the Chair, may be removed from Council Chambers by Police Department personnel or other agent
designated by City Council or City Administrator.
D. Councilmember Participation. Any member of the Council wishing to speak on any item on
the agenda shall be recognized by the Mayor to do so. This recognition can be informal. No
councilmember shall interrupt another councilmember. Councilmembers shall conduct themselves at all
times with civility and respect. They shall refrain from making any disparaging remarks concerning any
other member of the government body, employees or the public. If the Chair feels that there has been
sufficient discussion of an item and all councilmembers have had an opportunity to speak, the Chair can
call for a motion on the item. If no motion is received the item will be considered continued to allow further
thought by the councilmembers on the item. Any meeting designated as a work meeting shall be more
informal and councilmembers may freely participate as long as proper decorum is maintained.
E. Chairing the Meeting. The Mayor shall chair the meeting in a manner to accomplish the
following goals:
1. The Mayor, as Chair, shall pace the meeting so that all items on the agenda should be
addressed and either concluded or continued.
2. The Mayor shall open and introduce an item on the agenda in order, unless the Mayor
feels like there is a good reason to go out of order.
3. The Mayor, as Chair, shall ensure that the time limits on the public comment portion of
the meeting are complied with.
4. The Mayor, as Chair, shall use his/her best efforts to see that councilmembers and the
public are treated at all times with respect and civility and that the meetings are orderly.
F. How the Vote is Taken. A roll call vote shall be recorded for all ordinances, resolutions, or
any other item that a vote is required. A roll call vote will be considered taken as long as the actual vote of
each individual member is recorded. It is not necessary to have each individual councilmember vote
separately to be considered a roll call vote.
G. Quorum Defined and Minimum Vote Required. The number of councilmembers necessary to
constitute a quorum is three excluding the Mayor. The minimum number of yes votes required to pass
any ordinance or resolution, or to take any action by the Council, unless otherwise prescribed by law, is
three. The Mayor is only allowed to vote in accordance with state law such as a tie vote or on items
concerning the Mayor’s rights and privileges defined in the State law.
H. Reconsideration. Any action taken by the Council may not be reconsidered or rescinded at
any special meeting unless the number of members of the Council present at the meeting is equal to or
greater than the number of members present at the meeting when the action was approved or
disapproved.
I. Meeting Adjournment. Meetings of the City Council, as a goal, shall be scheduled to end at or
before 10:00 PM and the Mayor and City Council shall use their best efforts to conclude the meeting in a
timely manner. However, no motion to extend the time of the meeting is necessary to be made. The
meetings of the City Council shall not be adjourned until either all items listed in the agenda have been
acted upon or a motion to adjourn is made and approved by a majority of the City Council.
J. Attendance at Council Meetings. The City Council may compel the attendance of its own
members at its meetings and provide penalties it considers necessary for the failure to comply with an
exercise of the authority to compel attendance.
K. Electronic Meetings Authorization and Requirements. In order to include members of the City
Council through an electronic connection, a request for an electronic meeting must be made by a member
of the City Council up to three days prior to the meeting to allow arrangements for the electronic meeting
to be made. A quorum of councilmembers must be present at a single anchor location for the electronic
meeting to be held. However, if a proclamation of local, State or national emergency is in effect, a
majority of a quorum of the Council need not be physically present at the physical location from which the

Page 2-6
in order for an electronic meeting to be held.3 The City shall provide space and facilities at the anchor

comments from the public will be accepted during the electronic meeting, facilities at the anchor location
shall be provided so that interested persons and the public may attend, monitor and participate in the
open portions of the meeting. The Council may restrict the number of separate connections for members
of the Council that are allowed for an electronic meeting based on available equipment capability or
establish other procedures, limitations, or conditions governing electronic meetings not in conflict with this
section.
1. In order to participate in meetings electronically, councilmembers shall establish and
maintain their electronic connection for the entire Council meeting including all work sessions or other
scheduled items appearing on the meeting agenda. Small disconnections due to technical problems are
allowed in order to meet the intent of this requirement.

notice of the meeting in accordance with State Statute and post written notice at the anchor location. The

or logistical considerations.

property.
C. Any building the city leases to a tenant who places that tenant's name or information on such
building consistent with lease terms.
3.04.030. Naming or Renaming Procedures.
It is the policy of the city that the naming or renaming of any city facility shall be mutually
accomplished through joint cooperation of the mayor and city council. Accordingly, an ordinance naming
or renaming any city facility described in this chapter shall only be adopted consistent with a joint
resolution of the city council and the mayor.
3.04.040. Naming or Renaming Criteria.
The criteria set forth in this section may be considered by the city council and mayor in
determining whether to name or rename a city facility. Additional criteria may also be considered by the

A. The following accomplishments, achievements and circumstances may be considered when
evaluating any proposal to name or rename a city facility after any individual or group of individuals:
1. Extraordinary civic contribution to the community.
2. Loss of life in the line of duty while serving as a city employee.
3. Loss of life and/or performing a heroic act while serving in any branch of the United
States armed forces.
4. Widespread recognition as a national or historical figure.
5. Contributions of significant cost of acquisition and/or development of a specific city

evaluating any proposal to name or rename a city facility after any organization, including any nonprofit or
for profit entity:
1. Extraordinary civic contribution to the community.
2. Contributions of significant cost of acquisition and/or development of a specific city
facility.
C. Any city facility may be appropriately named or renamed after an event (or series of events)
with cultural or historical significance, provided such event has a meaningful and direct nexus to the city.
D. Any city facility may be appropriately named after adjacent or nearby streets, landmarks,
neighborhoods or other similarly identifiable geographic areas.
E. With regard to naming or renaming a city facility after any individual:
1. That individual should not be an incumbent elected or appointed official in local, state or
federal government.
2. That individual should not have been convicted of a felony.
3. The city shall obtain, or shall make a reasonable attempt to obtain, consent from such
individual or, if such individual is deceased or cannot be contacted, from members of the individual's
family.
F. City facilities should not be given any name that may:
1. Cause confusion due to duplication of, or similarity to, an existing named city facility or
location within the city.
2. Include or may be associated with the name of:
i. Any individual, group of individuals, or organization commonly associated with
tobacco, alcohol, obscenity, or any sexually oriented business or activity;
ii. Any religious or political organization, unless the name relates to a historic or

4. Is discriminatory, derogatory or offensive.

3.04.050. Revision, Addition, Revocation or Removal of Names.

nor shall it constitute a property interest owned by any person or organization.
Page 3-11
B. Names may be revised or added to any city facility pursuant to the criteria, guidelines and
procedures of this chapter.
C. The ordinance approving the naming or renaming of a city facility may include a sunset
provision under which the name will be removed from the city facility at the end of a specified period of
time or upon a particular date. In the event the ordinance fails to include such a sunset provision, the
naming or renaming of such city facility shall endure until modified.
D. When a city facility is removed, replaced or destroyed, the name of the city facility shall cease
to endure unless renamed pursuant to this section.
E. Upon circumstances arising after naming that would cast a negative image upon the city, the

3.04.060. Sponsorship Naming.
A. The mayor may, on behalf of the city, with the approval of the City Council, enter into a
sponsorship naming agreement with an individual, group of individuals or organization under which a city
facility specifically used to promote cultural arts or recreation is named or renamed in exchange for cash
or other significant contributions to the city. Any such agreement must be in writing, and the naming or
renaming of any city facility pursuant to such agreement must comply with the naming criteria of this
chapter. The written agreement must be specifically referenced in the joint resolution approving such

2. If deemed necessary, provide for an endowment fund or other financial resources
sufficient to pay the city facility's ongoing maintenance costs;

sponsorship naming agreement;

sponsorship naming agreement signed by the mayor is subject to and contingent upon adoption of a joint
resolution and ordinance pursuant to this chapter to name the city facility.
B. The donation of land, facilities, or funds for the acquisition, renovation or maintenance of any
real property, facilities, amenities, or any other resources directly or indirectly related to any city facility
shall not constitute an obligation by the city to name such city facility, or any portion thereof, after any
individual, group of individuals, or organization, except as set forth in a sponsorship naming agreement
executed and approved pursuant to this section.

Words and phrases that are defined in the Impact Fees Act shall have the same definition in this
Impact Fee Ordinance. The following words and phrases are defined as follows:
Development Activity means, except as otherwise provided in the Impact Fees Act, any construction or

the use of land within the Service Area that creates additional demand and need for public facilities.
Development Approval means any written authorization from the City that authorizes the commencement
of Development Activity.
Equivalent Residential Unit means that unit of demand that has an impact on the park, fire, police, storm

Impact Fee means a payment of money imposed upon new Development Activity as a condition of
development approval to mitigate the impact of the new development on public infrastructure. "Impact fee"
does not include a tax, special assessment, building permit fee, hookup fee, fee for project improvements,

Project Improvements means site improvements and facilities that are: planned and designed to provide
service for development resulting from a Development Activity; necessary for the use and convenience of
the occupants or users of development resulting from a Development Activity; and not identified or
reimbursed as a System Improvement. “Project Improvements” does not mean System Improvements as
more particularly defined herein.
Proportionate Share means the cost of public facility improvements that are roughly proportionate and
reasonably related to the service demands and needs of any Development Activity.
Public Facilities means impact fee facilities as defined in the Impact Fees Act that have a life expectancy

entity. For purposes of this Ordinance, and as defined in the Impact Fees Act, impact fee facilities include
those capital facilities described in the Impact Fees Facility Plan.
1 Title created with Ordinance #18-05, 5/17/18
Page 6-2
Service Area means a geographic area designated by the City on the basis of sound planning or
engineering principles in which a public facility, or a defined set of public facilities, provides service within
the area. The Service Area for purposes of this Ordinance is more particularly described in Section V.
System Improvements means existing public facilities that are: identified in the impact fee analysis under
Section 11-36a-304 of the Impact Fees Act; and designed to provide services to service areas within the
community at large and future public facilities identified in the impact fee analysis under Section 11-36a-
304 that are intended to provide service to service areas within the community at large. “System
Improvements” do not include project improvements as defined herein.
6.01.020. Statutory Authority and Restrictions.
A. Impact Fees Act Authority. The City is authorized to impose impact fees subject to and in
accordance with applicable provisions of the Impact Fees Act. An impact fee is defined as a payment of
money imposed upon new Development Activity as a condition of development approval to mitigate the
impact of the new development on public infrastructure. Impact fees may only be established for public
facilities as defined in Section 11-36a-102 that have a life expectancy of 10 or more years and are owned
or operated by or on behalf of a local political subdivision. Public facilities for which impact fees may be
imposed include public facilities for facilities.
B. Impact Fees Act Restrictions. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-202 of the Impact Fees Act, the City
may not impose an impact fee to: (1) cure deficiencies in public facilities serving existing development; (2)
raise the established level of service of a public facility serving existing development; (3) recoup more than
the local political subdivision's costs actually incurred for excess capacity in an existing System
Improvement; or (4) include an expense for overhead, unless the expense is calculated pursuant to a
methodology that is consistent with generally accepted cost accounting practices and the methodological
standards set forth by the Federal Office of Management and Budget for federal grant reimbursement.
6.01.030. Service Area.
The Impact Fees Act requires the City to establish one or more service areas within which the City
will calculate and impose a particular impact fee. The service area within which the proposed Impact Fees
will be imposed includes all of the area within the corporate limits and jurisdictional boundaries of the City.
6.01.040. Impact Fee Facilities Plan.
A. Impact Fee Facilities Plan Required. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-301 of the Impact Fees Act,
before imposing or amending an impact fee, the City is required to prepare an impact fee facilities plan to
determine the public facilities required to serve development resulting from new Development Activity. The
impact fee facilities plan shall identify the demands placed upon existing public facilities by new
Development Activity and the proposed means by which the City will meet those demands.
B. Citywide Impact Fees Facilities Plan. The City has, through its consultants, researched and
analyzed the factors set forth in Section 11-36a-302 of the Impact Fees Act and has caused to be prepared
a Citywide Impact Fees Facilities Plan ("IFFP"). The IFFP has been prepared based on reasonable growth
assumptions for the City and general demand characteristics of current and future users of facilities. The
IFFP identifies the impact on System Improvements created by Development Activity and estimates the
proportionate share of the costs of impacts on System Improvements that are reasonably related to new
Development Activity. As shown in the IFFP, the City has considered all revenue sources to finance the
impacts on System Improvements, including grants, bonds, interfund loans, impact fees, and anticipated or
accepted dedications of System Improvements. The IFFP establishes that impact fees are necessary to
maintain proposed level of service that complies with applicable provisions of Section 11-36a 302 of the
Impact Fees Act.
C. Plan Certification. The IFFP includes a written certification in accordance with Section 11-36a-
306 of the Impact Fees Act from the person or entity that prepared the plan certifying that the IFFP complies
in each and every relevant respect with the Impact Fees Act.
D. Compliance with Noticing Requirements. All noticing requirements set forth in the Impact Fees
Act, including, but not limited to, provisions of Title 11, Chapter 36a, Part 5, Notice, including notice of intent
to prepare an impact fee facilities plan, notice to adopt or amend an impact fee facilities plan, notice of
preparation of impact fee analysis, and notice of intent to adopt impact fee enactment, have been provided.
Copies of the IFFP and Storm Drain IFA, together with a summary designed to be understood by a lay
Page 6-3
person, and this Impact Fee Ordinance, have been made available to the public by placing a copy of the
IFFP and IFA, together with the summary, and this Ordinance, in the Brigham City Library and the City
Recorder's Office at Brigham City Hall at least ten (10) days before the public hearing.
6.01.050. Impact Fee Analysis.
A. Impact Fee Analysis Required. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-303 of the Impact Fees Act, each
local political subdivision intending to impose an impact fee shall prepare a written analysis of each impact
fee to be imposed and a summary of the impact fee analysis designed to be understood by a lay person.
The impact fee analysis identifies the anticipated impact on or consumption of any existing capacity of a
public facility by the anticipated Development Activity; identify the anticipated impact on System
Improvements required by the anticipated Development Activity to maintain the established level of service
for each public facility; demonstrates how the anticipated impacts are reasonably related to the anticipated
Development Activity; estimates the proportionate share of the costs for existing capacity that will be
recouped and the costs of impacts on System Improvements that are reasonably related to the new
Development Activity and identifies how the impact fee is calculated.
B. Impact Fees Analysis. The City has, through its consultants, researched and analyzed the
factors set forth in Section 11-36a-304 of the Impact Fees Act, including the proportionate share analysis
required therein, and has caused to be prepared an Impact Fees Analysis ("IFA"). The IFA identifies the
impacts upon public facilities required by the Development Activity and demonstrates how those impacts
on System Improvements are reasonably related to the Development Activity, estimates the proportionate
share of the costs of impacts on System Improvements that are reasonably related to the Development
Activity, and identifies how the Impact Fees are calculated.
C. Analysis Certification. The IFA includes a written certification in accordance with Section 11-
36a-306 of the Impact Fees Act from the person or entity that prepared the analysis certifying that the IFA
complies in each and every relevant respect with the Impact Fees Act.
D. Compliance with Noticing Requirements. All noticing requirements set forth in the Impact Fees
Act, including, but not limited to, provisions of Title 11, Chapter 36a, Part 5, Notice, including notice of intent
to prepare an impact fee facilities plan, notice to adopt or amend an impact fee facilities plan, notice of
preparation of impact fee analysis, and notice of intent to adopt impact fee enactment, have been provided.
Copies of the IFFP and IFA, together with a summary designed to be understood by a lay person, and this
Impact Fee Ordinance, have been made available to the public by placing a copy of the IFFP and IFA,
together with the summary, and this Ordinance, in the Brigham City Library and the City Recorder's Office
at Brigham City Hall at least ten (10) days before the public hearing.
6.01.060. Calculation of Impact Fees.
A. Impact Fee Calculations. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-305, in calculating an impact fee, the
City may include: the construction contract price; the cost of acquiring land, improvements, materials, and
fixtures; the cost for planning, surveying, and engineering fees for services provided for and directly related
to the construction of the System Improvements; and debt service charges if the City might use impact fees
as a revenue stream to pay principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued to finance
the costs of the System Improvements. In calculating the proposed Impact Fees, the City has based such
amounts calculated on realistic estimates and the assumptions underlying such estimates are more
particular disclosed in the IFA.
B. Previously Incurred Costs. To the extent that new growth and development will be served by
previously constructed improvements, the City's Impact Fees may include public facility costs and
outstanding bond costs related to the improvements previously incurred by the City. As provided in the IFA,
a buy-in component is contemplated in the analysis and therefore the interest costs associated with any
outstanding storm bond obligations have been included in the calculation of the Impact Fees.
6.01.070. Impact Fee Schedule and Formula.
A. Impact Fee Schedule or Formula Required. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-402 of the Impact Fees
Act, the City is required to provide a schedule of impact fees for each type of Development Activity that
specifies the amount of the impact fee to be imposed for each type of System Improvement or the formula
that the City will use to calculate each impact fee.
Page 6-4
B. Maximum Impact Fee Schedule. Based on the IFA, the maximum Impact Fees which the City
may impose on Development Activity within the defined Service Area is set forth in the following schedules:

6.01.080. Adjustments and Credits.
A. Adjustments. In accordance with Section 11-36a-402 of the Impact Fees Act, the City may
adjust the Impact Fees at the time the fee is charged to respond to 1) unusual circumstances in specific
cases, or 2) a request for a prompt and individualized impact fee review for the Development Activity of the
state, a school district, or a charter school and an offset or credit for a public facility for which an impact fee
has been or will be collected, and 3) to ensure that impact fees are imposed fairly. The Impact Fees
assessed to a particular development may also be adjusted should the developer supply sufficient written
information, studies and/or data to the City showing a discrepancy between the fee being assessed and
the actual impact on the system.
B. Developer Credits. In accordance with Section 11-36a-402 of the Impact Fees Act, a developer,
including a school district or a charter school, may be allowed a credit against Impact Fees or proportionate
reimbursement of Impact Fees if the developer 1) dedicates land for a System Improvement, 2) builds and
dedicates some or all of a System Improvement, or 3) dedicates a public facility that the City and the
developer agree will reduce the need for a System Improvement; provided that the System Improvement
is: (i) identified in the City's IFFP; and (ii) is required by the City as a condition of approving the Development
Activity. To the extent required in Section 11-36a-402, the City shall provide a credit against Impact Fees
for any dedication of land for, improvements to, or new construction of any System Improvements provided
by the developer if the facilities are , 1) are System Improvement; or 2) are dedicated to the public and
offset the need for an identified System Improvement.
C. Waiver for "Public Purpose". The City Council may, on a project by project basis, authorize
exceptions or adjustments to the Impact Fees for Development Activity attributable to 1) low income
housing; 2) the State; 3) a school district; 4) a charter school; or 5) other Development Activity which the
City Council determines to have a broad public purpose.
1. Waivers provided under this paragraph shall be by resolution of the City Council.
2. For development activities requesting a waiver as serving a broad public purpose, the City
Council shall find that such activities will provide benefits to the citizens of Brigham City as a whole and will
accomplish a defined purpose of the Brigham City General Plan that may otherwise require the expenditure
of City funds to accomplish. If the City Council is unable to make such a finding, no exemption shall be
provided.
3. The City Council shall consider requests for exemption of development activities due to the
provision of low income housing only under the following circumstances:
a. The developer is a bona fide non-profit organization which has the provision of low
income housing as a principal objective;
b. The Developer has established procedures that will ensure that the dwelling or
dwellings for which the exemption is requested will remain affordable to low income households for a period
of not less than thirty (30) years;
c. The developer has established procedures that will guarantee the long term
maintenance and upkeep of the low income housing development, including all structures, landscaping and
other site features; and
d. The Planning Commission and City Council find that the project demonstrates quality
in site planning and architecture.
D. “Impact Fee Adjustment Committee.” Requests for adjustment or waiver of Impact Fees, or for
developer credits, shall be reviewed by the Impact Fee Adjustment Committee (the “Committee”), which
shall be comprised of three (3) members, which shall be the Community and Economic Development
Director, the Chief Building Official, and the City Engineer. The Director of Public Works and the Director
of Public Power shall advise the Committee, and may act as alternate members in the event that one of the
committee members is unable to attend. Committee members may also designate a member of their
respective departments to act as their alternate in the event they are unable to attend.
1. All requests for adjustment or waiver of Impact Fees or developer credits shall be submitted
to the Community and Economic Development Department, which shall forward the request to the
Committee. The Committee shall convene as needed to review all requests.
Page 6-7
2. Requests for adjustment or waiver of Impact Fees or developer credits must be requested
in writing by the developer, and must include evidence supporting the request, and compiled, as applicable,
in a standard form as it relates to Equivalent Residential Units as defined herein.
3. If the request for adjustment or waiver or developer credit is the result of land dedication,
or improvement of new public services or buildings, then a fair market appraisal shall be made of the
proposal and shall be submitted, with any other evidence, to the committee for review. The appraisal shall
be at the expense of the developer. Land dedication must first be approved by the City Council.
a. All submitted requests shall be reviewed by the committee within 14 days from the date
a complete application is submitted, and all decisions of the committee shall be submitted in writing to the
developer within 30 days following the committee meeting.
b. The committee is authorized or deny requests for adjustment of impact fees. In such
cases, the committee’s decision may be appealed to the City Council
c. The committee shall make recommendations to the City Council regarding requests
for waiver of Impact Fees.
d. Minutes of committee meetings shall be submitted to the City Council.
e. The Committee shall be subject to the requirements of the Utah Open and Public
Meetings Act (Title 52 Chapter 4 of the Utah Code).
4. Except for the exemption of low income housing, in the event that the City Council exempts
a project from the payment of all or a portion of Impact Fees, it shall establish one or more sources of funds
other than Impact Fees to offset funds that would otherwise be paid in the form of Impact Fees. Applications
for exceptions are to be filed with the City at the time the applicant first requests the extension of service to
the applicant's development or property.
6.01.090. Notice and Hearing.
A. Notice. All noticing requirements set forth in the Impact Fees Act, including, but not limited to,
provisions of Title 11, Chapter 36a, Part 5, Notice, including notice of intent to prepare an impact fee
facilities plan, notice to adopt or amend an impact fee facilities plan, notice of preparation of impact fee
analysis, and notice of intent to adopt impact fee enactment, have been provided. Copies of the IFFP and
IFA, together with a summary designed to be understood by a lay person, and this Impact Fee Ordinance,
have been made available to the public by placing a copy of the IFFP and IFA, together with the summary,
and this Ordinance, in the Brigham City Library and the Recorder's Office at Brigham City Hall at least ten
(10) days before the public hearing. Notice has also been provided in accordance with applicable provisions
of Utah Code Ann. § 10-9a-205.
B. Hearing. The City Council held a public hearing regarding the IFFP, the IFA, and this Impact
Fee Ordinance, on May 17, 2018, and a copy of the Ordinance was available in its substantially final form
at the Brigham City Library and the City Recorder's Office in the Brigham City Hall at least ten (10) days
before the date of the hearing, all in conformity with the requirements of Utah Code Ann. § 10-9a-205 and
applicable noticing provisions of the Impact Fees Act.
6.01.100. Impact Fee Account and Expenditures.
A. Impact Fees Accounting. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-601 of the Impact Fees Act, the City will
establish a separate interest bearing ledger account for each type of public facility for which an impact fee
is collected, deposit a receipt for an impact fee in the appropriate ledger account established herein, and
retain the interest earned on each fund or ledger account in the fund or ledger account.
B. Reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, the City shall prepare a report on each fund or ledger
account showing the source and expenditures as required by law. Annually, the City shall produce and
transmit to the State Auditor a certified report in accordance with Section 11-36a-601 in a format developed
by the State Auditor.
C. Impact Fee Expenditures. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-602 of the Impact Fees Act, the City
may expend Impact Fees only for a System Improvement: (i) identified in the IFFP; and (ii) for the specific
public facility type for which the fee was collected. Impact fees will be expended on a first-in first-out basis.
D. Time of Expenditure. Except as otherwise provided by law, the City shall expend or encumber
Impact Fees for a permissible use within six (6) years of their receipt. For purposes of this calculation, the
first funds received shall be deemed to be the first funds expended.
Page 6-8
E. Extension of Time. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-602 of the Impact Fees Act, the City may hold
the impact fees for longer than six (6) years if it identifies in writing: (i) an extraordinary and compelling
reason why the fees should be held longer than six (6) years; and (ii) an absolute date by which the fees
will be expended.
F. Refunds. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-603 of the Impact Fees Act, the City shall refund any
Impact Fees paid by a developer, plus interest earned, when: (i) the developer does not proceed with the
Development Activity and has a written request for a refund; (ii) the fees have not been spent or
encumbered; and (iii) no impact has resulted. An impact that would preclude a developer from a refund
from the City may include any impact reasonably identified by the City, including, but not limited to, the City
having sized facilities and/or paid for, installed and/or caused the installation of facilities based in whole or
in part upon the developer's planned Development Activity even though that capacity may, at some future
time, be utilized by another development.
G. Other Impact Fees. To the extent allowed by law, the City Council may negotiate or otherwise
impose impact fees and other fees different from those currently charged. Those charges may, at the
discretion of the City Council, include but not be limited to reductions or increases in impact fees, all or part
of which may be reimbursed to the developer who installed improvements that service the land to be
connected with the City’s system.
H. Additional Fees and Costs. The Impact Fees authorized herein are separate from and in
addition to user fees and other charges lawfully imposed by the City and other fees and costs that may not
be included as itemized component parts of the Impact Fee Schedule. In charging any such fees as a
condition of development approval, the City recognizes that the fees must be a reasonable charge for the
service provided.
I. Fees Effective at Time of Payment. Unless otherwise provided in the City's Consolidated Fee
Schedule, the City will collect the Impact Fees prior to final plat recording or prior to building permit issuance,
as applicable. The fees will be calculated by the City. Unless the City is otherwise bound by a contractual
requirement, the Impact Fees shall be determined from the fee schedule in effect at the time of payment.
J. Imposition of Additional Fee or Refund after Development. Should any developer undertake
development activities such that the ultimate acreage or other impact of the Development Activity is not
revealed to the City, either through inadvertence, neglect, a change in plans, or any other cause
whatsoever, and/or the Impact Fee is not initially charged against all acreage within the development, the
City shall be entitled to charge an additional Impact Fee to the developer or other appropriate person
covering the acreage for which an impact fee was not previously paid.
6.01.110. Challenges to Impact Fees.
A. Request for Information. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-701, a person or entity required to pay an
Impact Fee who believes the Impact Fee does not meet the requirements of law may file a written request
for information with the City Administrator. As required by law, the City Administrator shall, within two (2)
weeks after the receipt of the request for information provide the person or entity with the IFFP, the IFA,
and any other relevant information relating to the Impact Fee.
B. Advisory Opinion. A potentially aggrieved person may request an advisory opinion from a
neutral third party regarding compliance of the Impact Fees with the Impact Fees Act by filing such request
with the Office of the Property Rights Ombudsman in accordance with the procedures and provisions of
Title 13, Chapter 43, known as the Property Rights Ombudsman Act. The aggrieved party requesting an
advisory opinion is not required to exhaust the administrative appeals procedures set forth in Subsection 3
before requesting an advisory opinion.
C. Appeal. A person or entity that has paid Impact Fees under the provisions of this Ordinance
may challenge such impact fees pursuant to the provisions set forth in Title 11, Chapter 36a, and Part 7 of
the Impact Fees Act regarding Challenges.
1. Grounds for Challenge. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-701, a person or entity that has paid
Impact Fees under the provisions of this Ordinance may challenge: (1) the impact fees; (2) whether the City
complied with the notice requirements of the Impact Fees Act with respect to the imposition of the impact
fees; and/or (3) whether the City complied with other procedural requirements of the Impact Fees Act for
imposing the impact fee.
2. Sole Remedy. The sole remedy for challenging the notice requirements is the equitable
remedy of requiring the City to correct the defective notice and repeat the process. The sole remedy for
Page 6-9
challenging the impact fee is a refund of the difference between what the person or entity paid as an impact
fee and the amount the impact fee should have been if it had been correctly calculated. Reasonable
attorney’s fees may be awarded to the substantially prevailing party to the extent provided in the Impact
Fees Act.
3. Imitation. A challenge to an impact fee is initiated by filing:
a. An appeal to the City Council pursuant to the administrative appeal procedures set
forth herein;
b. A request for arbitration as provided in Section 11-36a-705 of the Impact Fees Act; or
c. An action in district court.

accordance with the time limitations set forth in Section 11-36a-702, depending upon the type of challenge.
The deadline to file an action in district court is tolled from the date that a challenge is filed using the
administrative procedures set forth in Subsection 3 until thirty (30) days on which a final decision is rendered
in the administrative appeals procedure.
D. Administrative Appeal Procedure. The City hereby adopts an administrative appeal procedure
to consider and decide challenges to the Impact Fees. Any person or entity that has paid an Impact Fee
pursuant to this Ordinance may challenge or appeal the impact fee by filing written notice of administrative
appeal with the City within thirty (30) days after the day on which the person or entity paid the impact fee.
The notice of appeal shall set forth the grounds for the appeal and shall include any applicable filing fees
as set forth in the City's Consolidated Fee Schedule. Upon receiving the written notice of appeal, the City
Council shall set a hearing date to consider the merits of the challenge or appeal. The person or entity
challenging or appealing the fee may appear at the hearing and present any written or oral evidence
deemed relevant to the challenge or appeal. Representatives of the City may also appear and present
evidence to support the imposition of the fee. The City Council shall hold a hearing and make a decision
within thirty (30) days after the date the challenge or appeal is filed.
E. Mediation. In addition to the methods of challenging an impact fee as provided herein, a
specified public agency may require the City to participate in mediation of any applicable impact fee in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11-36a-704 of the Impact Fees Act. A written request for
mediation must be filed in accordance with Section 11-36a-704 no later than thirty (30) days after the day
on which the impact fee is paid.
F. Declaratory Judgment Action. Pursuant to Section 11-36a-701, a person or entity residing in or
owning properly within the Service Area, or an organization, association, or a corporation representing the
interests of persons or entities owning property within the Service Area are deemed to have standing to file
a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of an impact fee.
6.01.120. Miscellaneous.
A. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or phrase of this Impact Fee
Ordinance shall be declared invalid for any reason, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
this Ordinance, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose, the provisions of this Impact
Fee Ordinance are declared to be severable.
B. Interpretation. This Impact Fee Ordinance has been divided into sections, subsections,
paragraphs and clauses for convenience only and the interpretation of this Ordinance shall not be affected
by such division or by any heading contained herein.
C. Other Impact Fees Not Repealed. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, this Impact
Fee Ordinance shall not repeal, modify or affect any impact fee of the City in existence as of the effective
date of this Ordinance.

For the purpose of this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given
herein:
A. Master Metering means measurement of electricity consumption of several tenants or
housing units using a single meter. That is, one meter measures the energy usage for several
households, tenants, recreation vehicles or mobile home parks collectively.
3 Ordinance 19-13, dated 08/01/19
4 Ordinance 11-01, dated 04/07/11

B. Sub-metering means the use of a meter(s) connected after the main revenue meter and are
typically used for monitoring energy usage or other information.
C. Transient Building means transient multiple occupancy buildings and transient mobile home
parks normally used as temporary domiciles and in such buildings as hotels, motels, dormitories, rooming
houses, hospitals, nursing homes and mobile home parks designated for recreational vehicles.
10.02.020. Unlawful Act.
At any point on the City’s electrical grid system where adequate capacity is available to service
transient buildings or temporary domiciles, no transient buildings or the expansion thereof as defined in
City Code will be allowed to sub-meter the City’s electrical energy. Any attempt by owner(s) or
proprietor(s) to sub-meter the City’s electrical energy will result in the disconnection of their electrical
service. Any violation of this chapter will be considered an infraction of the law.
10.02.030. Electrical Energy Services.
A. Brigham City’s electrical energy service will be supplied to each transient building defined in
City Code directly by the City. Service to each tenant will be separately metered and billed under the
City’s approval rate schedule in the name of the individual tenant whenever possible or in the name of the
facility owner(s) or proprietor(s) where circumstances make it impractical to bill the tenants directly.
Notwithstanding, the City will supply electric energy through a single point of delivery to approved
locations under the rates set forth in the City’s approved rate schedules.
B. Should the owner(s) or proprietor(s) of transient buildings currently receive single point of
delivery service under the City’s approved rate schedule, the owner or proprietor will sub-meter each
tenant for electrical service rendered under the applicable residential rate schedule of the City. Copies of
the City’s residential rate schedules will be furnished to the owner(s) or proprietor(s) of each facility who
has a single point of delivery service. The owner(s) or proprietor(s) shall post in several conspicuous
places around the facilities copies of the City’s residential rate schedule with a statement that the charge
for electric service for each unit or space will be billed in accordance with the appropriate residential
service rate. The owner(s) or proprietor(s) shall not meter or sell electric energy to any tenant under any
other rate or system of charges. Evidence of any sale or attempt to sell electric energy by owners or
proprietor(s) on any other rate or system of charge except as provided herein shall give the City the right
to discontinue service upon five (5) days written notice. Miscellaneous loads such as general lighting of
the area, laundry facilities, washroom, recreational facilities, etc., available only to facility tenants will be
considered residential usage and served under the applicable schedule. Loads for commercial purposes
such as stores, restaurants, service stations and other distinct and separate commercial establishments
will be separately metered and served under applicable schedules.
C. Developers of transient building projects desiring single point of delivery service shall furnish
and install all required material(s) from the property line to the meter base and be responsible for the care
and maintenance of them, except the City will install and own all meters and sub-meters and will be
responsible for their care and maintenance and periodic testing.

maintained in a condition that does not create a health or safety hazard to persons working or residing in
the vicinity, or to the general public.
K. Dangerous Conditions. Any fence, wall, shed, deck, house, garage, building, structure or any
part of any of the aforesaid; or any tree, pole, smokestack; or any excavation, hole, pit, basement, cellar,
sidewalk, subspace, dock or loading dock; or any lot, land, yard, premises, or location which in its
entirety, or in any part thereof, by reason of the condition in which the same is found or permitted to be or
remain, shall or may endanger the health, safety, life, limb or property, or cause any hurt, harm,
inconvenience, discomfort, damage or injury to any one or more individuals in the City.
L. Other Conditions. Anything which is injurious to the health or morals or which is indecent or
offensive to the senses or whatever is dangerous to human life or health or whatever renders soil, air,
water or food impure or unwholesome or whatever is an obstruction to the free use of property so as to
interfere with the enjoyment of life or property is a nuisance.
13.01.240. Exceptions.
No situation, conduct, activity, etc. which is done or maintained under the express authority of an
authoritative statute, ordinance, or court ruling shall be declared a nuisance.
13.01.250. Responsibility for Nuisances.
Every Responsible Person(s) is responsible for abating any nuisances found on the Responsible
Person’s property pursuant to this ordinance, and every Responsible Person(s) is liable, both civilly and
criminally, for any and all costs, fees, damages or penalties associated with such nuisance. Every
successive owner or tenant of a property or premises who fails to abate a continuing nuisance upon or in
the use of such property or premises caused by a former owner or tenant is responsible therefore in the
same manner as the one who first created it.
13.01.260. Nuisance Abatement.
A. Administration. This ordinance shall be administered and enforced by the Code Enforcement
Officer. In case of nuisances involving criminal violations, or violations of codes typically administered and
Page 13-9
enforced by the Police Department, this ordinance may also be administered and enforced by the Police
Department.
B. Finding of Nuisance. If a Code Enforcement Officer finds that a nuisance exists, they shall
attempt to have the Responsible Person abate the nuisance. Although the Code Enforcement Officer’s
first step in correcting or abating the nuisance will always be to seek voluntary compliance, the Code
Enforcement Officer may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies available pursuant to this
ordinance, state law, or common law in order to abate the nuisance. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted to prohibit the City from engaging in its standard prosecution practices. Therefore, the City
may prosecute violators of City ordinances or state laws without first having to comply with the provisions
of this ordinance, even though the activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute a nuisance under
this ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance shall be interpreted to prevent the City from enforcing applicable
City ordinances or codes without first treating the offending conduct, situation, activity, etc. as a nuisance
pursuant to this ordinance.
C. Repeated Short-Term Nuisances. It is recognized by this ordinance that certain nuisances by
their nature may occur for a short period of time such that at the time of contact with the Responsible
Person by the Code Enforcement Officer, the nuisance may not be occurring or evident. In such cases,
the Code Enforcement Officer shall document at least three such occurrences before initiating any action
to abate the nuisance. Upon such documentation, the Code Enforcement Officer may proceed to abate
the nuisance pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance, notwithstanding that the nuisance is not
occurring or evident during the abatement process. In such case, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
determine that a reasonable probability exists that the nuisance will continue to occur periodically if
abatement is not pursued.
D. Voluntary Correction.
1. Contact. Before taking other steps to abate the nuisance, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall make a reasonable attempt to secure voluntary correction or abatement of the nuisance by:
a. contacting the Responsible Person(s), where possible;
b. explaining the nuisance;
E. Non-Voluntary Correction.
1. Enforcement If the land owner or resident fails to correct or abate the nuisance, the Code
Enforcement Officer may still abate the nuisance using one or more of the procedures set forth in this
ordinance, state law, or common law.
2. Civil Actions. Either the City or any private person directly affected by a nuisance may
bring a civil action as allowed by law to abate or enjoin the nuisance, or for damages for causing or
maintaining the nuisance (including the cost, if any, of cleaning the subject property).
3. Criminal Actions. Criminal actions may be initiated by criminal citation from the Code
Enforcement Officer, Police Department or by long form information.
a. Any Responsible Person who maintains or assists in maintaining a nuisance is guilty
of a Class C Misdemeanor.
b. If the alleged nuisance is also a violation of a provision of City Code (other than this
nuisance ordinance) or state law, the Responsible Person may be charged under the specific provision of
City Code or state law, even if the Code Enforcement Officer did not first attempt to obtain voluntary
correction as provided in Section 13.01.260(D) of this ordinance.
c. Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes or interferes with the City or its
agents, or with the Responsible Person, in the performance of duties imposed by this ordinance is guilty
of a Class B Misdemeanor.
4. Abatement by Eviction. Whenever there is reason to believe that a nuisance is kept,
maintained, or exists in the City, the City Attorney or any citizen(s) residing in the City, or any person or
entity doing business in the City, in his, her, or their own names, may maintain an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction to abate the nuisance and obtain an order for the automatic eviction of the tenant
of the property harboring the nuisance. The eviction shall take place as specified in Utah law.
5. Lien for Costs. If a person fails to pay any fines or costs related to nuisance abatement
when due, the City may record a lien on the property or premises of the full amount of the unpaid fines
and costs.
6. Non-Exclusive Remedies. The City may take any or all of the above-mentioned remedies
(administrative, civil or criminal) to abate a nuisance and/or to punish any person or entity that creates,
causes, or allows, a nuisance to exist. The abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the
City or any person to recover damages or penalties for its past existence.

representatives shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or

refuses to allow the enforcement officers to enter and inspect the property, the officer may obtain and
execute a search warrant.

premises shall fail or neglect, after property request is made as herein provided, to properly permit entry

maintain a list of all persons holding licenses and the status of each such license.
14.02.080. Fees for Business License.

licenses shall pay license fees as otherwise fixed in this Title. In addition to the other penalties specified
in this Title, in the event that a business has operated without a license, it shall pay fees and penalties
equal to the fees and penalties that would have been assessed for that period of time for which the
business operated prior to obtaining a business license. By way of illustration, if a business has operated
for one year or portions of a year prior to obtaining a business license, the business shall pay the license
fee for that period of time in which the license application is made, and shall also pay the appropriate fee
for the year for the time prior to that in which the license is obtained.9
14.02.090. Fees for Circuses/Carnivals.
Fees for circuses/carnivals shall be set by resolution of the City Council.
14.02.100. Fee Payments.

Department.
14.02.110. License Term and Renewal Procedure.
Business licenses shall be valid for twelve (12) months from the day of issuance, unless otherwise
specified. On or before thirty (30) calendar days before expiration, the Department shall send a statement
to each current licensee within the City notifying the business of the need for renewal.
Fees remaining due and unpaid as of the date of expiration shall have added thereto a penalty
(late fee) in an amount set forth by resolution of the City Council. This fee may change from time to time
as determined by resolution of the City Council. Businesses may not renew its business license or apply
for any new business license in the name of any officer or member of the delinquent business until the
mandatory late fee is paid.
In the event that a license has expired and an application is received for a new business license
for a business that has operated in violation of this paragraph, the applicant shall be responsible for
payment of the penalty amount.
Operating a business without a current business license is considered a separate class B
Misdemeanor for every day that the business operates without a license. In the event that the City
pursues legal action under this paragraph, the City is entitled to recover attorney’s fees and court costs
associated with such action, in addition to the outstanding business license fees.

any person subject to licensing under this Chapter. Likewise, no such mistakes shall prevent or prejudice
the refund to licensees of amounts overpaid by reason of mistakes.

For the purpose of this Chapter, whenever any of the following words, terms or definitions are
used herein, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this Section.
A. Transient Lodging Facility. Shall mean: any building or property, its associated parking,
landscaping and other ancillary facilities with more than ten (10) rental units, that provides lodging
accommodations on a daily or other basis or used or maintained as or advertised or held out to the public
to be an inn, motel, hotel or any other place where sleeping, rooming, conference or exhibition
accommodations are furnished for lease or rent, whether with or without meals. One room offered for
rental with or without an adjoining bath shall be considered as a single hotel or motel unit. In no event
shall these terms be construed to mean rooming houses, dormitories, apartment houses or other types of
permanent residential uses.
B. Calls for Service. Shall mean: calls for the Brigham City Police Department or other law
enforcement agencies concerning a Transient Lodging Facility in connection with law enforcement
services related to criminal activity, civil disputes, or violations of local, state or federal laws, which result
in law enforcement personnel being dispatched or directed to the Transient Lodging Facility. Calls for
Service include incidents observed by police that a violation of the law has occurred or is occurring at the
Transient Lodging Facility. Multiple calls for one discrete event shall count as one Call for Service. Calls
for Service shall not include the following: calls initiated by the Owner, Manager, or employee of a
Transient Lodging Facility; medical calls unrelated to criminal activity; calls originating from the Transient
Lodging Facility but relating to off-premises disturbances; calls related to the enforcement of an existing

D. Misrepresentation. Any material misrepresentation in a Lodging Permit application or failure to
provide the required information are grounds for denial.
E. Authorization and Consent. The submission of a Lodging Permit application hereunder shall
constitute the consent of the applicant, its owners, and managers to an annual inspection of the entire
premises by any authorized personnel of Brigham City Corporation in accordance with this chapter. An
applicant or licensee’s refusal to grant access to the premises for an inspection may constitute grounds
for denial of a pending application or renewal of a Lodging Permit.
F. Scheduling Inspections. Transient Lodging Facility licensees and Lodging Permit applicants
shall schedule written inspections with the Community and Economic Development Department not less
than sixty (60) days prior to the date in which their then-current business license or Lodging Permit

agents and employees, in gaining access to every room, including but not limited to requiring tenants to
change rooms to permit inspection of every room at the earliest possible time.
G. Violations Revealed During Inspection. In the event an inspection reveals the violation of any
applicable standard, ordinance, state or federal law, the violation shall be documented in writing and
submitted to the Transient Lodging Facility. The Transient Lodging Facility shall be responsible for
correcting the violation(s) within the timeline specified by Brigham City. If upon subsequent inspection the
violation has not been corrected then Brigham City may deny a Lodging Permit, issue a citation to the
Transient Lodging Facility for any violation or enter into a compliance agreement whereby the Transient
Lodging Facility agrees to correct the violation and/or pay a specified fine to the City in lieu of issuance of
a citation.

inspections conducted by a third party pursuant to the Transient Lodging Facility’s franchise requirements

least annually and that the franchise inspection complies with the requirements of this chapter.

action based upon any actual or alleged violation and the City prevails in such action, the City shall also
be entitled to recover the costs incurred by the City in providing personnel to investigate, process,
prosecute, or testify at any hearing to such legal action, which cost shall be consistent with the costs
associated with the process of reinspection (cost plus 5%), and the Transient Lodging Facility shall be
responsible for such costs.

A. Compliance with Brigham City Ordinances. All Transient Lodging Facilities in Brigham City

discover the occurrence of any illegal act in any room or on the premises under such circumstances in
which a reasonable person, exercising ordinary care and diligence, would surmise that such activity is
occurring. The failure to set forth the true identity of and correct hours of occupancy by any guest shall be
deemed to show knowledge on the part of the Owner, operator, or property manager of such illegal
purpose or use.

Chapter 14.18. Sexually Oriented Businesses.27, 28
14.18.010. Purpose and Findings.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order
to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Brigham City, and to establish
27 Section 14.18 added with adoption of Ordinance 98-16, 4/23/98
28 Entire Section 14.18 amended with adoption of Ordinance 05-04, dated 2/3/05
Page 14-40
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within Brigham City. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict
or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
B. Findings. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in
hearings and in reports made available to the Brigham City Council, and on findings incorporated in the
cases of Pap’s A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501

Rec. E 3750; and reports of secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses,
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona – 1984; Minneapolis, Minnesota-1980; Houston, Texas -
1997; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Los Angeles, California -

Bellevue, Washington, - 1998; Newport News, Virginia - 1996; New York Times Square study – 1994;
Phoenix, Arizona – 1995-98; and also on findings from the paper entitled “Stripclubs According to
Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence,” by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and
Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from “Sexually Oriented
Businesses: An Insider’s View,” by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan House Committee on
Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000, and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group
On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Brigham
City Council finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy
activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments, if any.
Further, there is presently no mechanism in this City to make the owners and operators of these
establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
2. Certain employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses defined in this ordinance
as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than
employees of other establishments.
3. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually
oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing
films, videos, or live sex shows.
4. Offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such activities, which creates
unhealthy conditions.
5. Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented
businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses,
or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs.
6. Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually
oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus
infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and chancroid.
7. According to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an estimated 650,000 to
900,000 Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new HIV infections occurring each year is now
about 41,000. Men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
8. Relevant statistics revealed that a total of 1,893 AIDS cases had been reported in Utah
through June 2000.
9. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 1 in 3 people
with HIV do not know they are infected.
Page 14-41
10. The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported
annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990.
11. The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a
high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990.
12. The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised
the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous
drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
13. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and
gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of U.S. Dept. of Health & Human
Services.
14. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because
the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities.
15. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of
sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
16. The findings noted in paragraphs number 1 through 15 raise substantial governmental
concerns.
17. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
18. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of
that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further,
such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore-nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons
and employees, as well as the citizens of Brigham City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances
that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
19. Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult
booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in adult theatres.
20. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior
by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working
in such establishments.
21. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the dayto-
day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is
substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of
dissemination of illegal obscenity, child pornography, and to minors, materials harmful to them;
22. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a
limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this
ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
23. The fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a sexually related crime
leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this
ordinance.
24. The barring of such individuals from employment in sexually oriented businesses for a
specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of illegal material, to prevent conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, and to preclude the establishment of criminal
enterprises within Brigham City.
25. The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of Brigham City will be
promoted by the enactment of this ordinance.

interested party. Upon receipt of the application the panel shall find that a special individual reason makes
the strict letter of the standard and practical, and shall find the modification is in conformance with the

which eventually enters into the storm water system and natural water bodies such as rivers,
streams, and lakes.32
LL. Sump shall mean a formalized structure underground, surrounded by drain rock, that acts as
a detention basin to allow the slow release of water into the surrounding sub-soil. Sumps
usually receive storm water runoff from paved areas such as streets, parking lots, building
roofs, etc.
MM. UPDES. Utah Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. All definitions found in the General
Permit for Discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s), not
included in the above, are hereby incorporated by reference.33

interpretation of this ordinance.
24.05.050. Storm Drain Utility Fee.
A. Imposed. Each developed parcel of real property in the City shall be charged a storm
drain utility fee.
B. ESU. The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service units (ESUs) contained in
the parcel. The City Council finds that the ESU is the most accurate measurement for determining the
amount that each parcel contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm drain utility. Based
on a study completed by the City Engineer, the City Council finds and establishes that one ESU equals
3,000 square feet of impervious surface area.
C. Calculation. The City Council finds that each single-family residential parcel contributes
approximately the same amount of storm water runoff. Therefore, each developed single-family
residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one (1) ESU. All other developed parcels, including multiple
family residential parcels, shall be charged a fee based on the number of ESUs on the parcel. If there is
more than one City utility bill for the parcel, the fee shall be divided between the City utility bills covering
the parcel. The actual monthly fee (service charge) shall be computed by multiplying the total ESUs for
the parcel by the monthly rate.35
D. Charge per ESU. The amount charged for each ESU shall be established by resolution of
the City Council.
E. Exemptions and Credits. The Storm Drain Credit Review Committee may establish
exemptions and credits to the storm drain utility fee. Exemptions set forth by City Resolution 98-20
include the following:36
1. Undeveloped Parcels. Undeveloped parcels shall not pay any storm water drainage utility
fees.
2. Streets. The City Council finds that all streets (publicly and privately owned) are part of the
storm utility conveyance system and are therefore exempt from the storm drain fee. For the purpose of
this section “streets” shall include the following:
a. Any publicly owned rights-of-way.
b. Any property that has been dedicated, deeded or condemned as a street and accepted
by the City as a street.
c. Any property that has been abandoned to the public as a street, if the City considers the
property a street and maintains it as such.
d. Any thoroughfares (publicly or privately owned) that are open to the public, provide
access to real property, and are used primarily for vehicular traffic.
e. Any railroad rights-of-way.37
3. Common Area. Common areas in residential condominium and P.U.D. developments shall
not be assessed a storm drain utility fee if each of the residential units in the development are assessed
the standard residential fee.38
F. Policies. The Public Works Director may adopt policies, consistent with this ordinance and
any resolutions passed by the City Council, to assist in the application, administration and interpretation
of this ordinance.
G. Appeals. Any person or entity that believes that this ordinance, or any storm drain utility rate
resolution, was interpreted or applied erroneously may appeal to the Director of Public Works. The appeal
shall be in writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and shall be made within ten (10) days of
the decision, action, or bill being appealed. The Director may elect to hold a hearing on the appeal. The
Director shall decide the appeal within ten (10) days of when the appeal is filed. If the person or entity is
not satisfied with the Director's decision, a further appeal may be made to the City Council (or his or her
designee). The appeal to the City Council shall follow the same procedure as the appeal to the Director.
The City Council's decision shall be final and binding on all parties.
24.05.060. Billing.
A. The City Council finds that the City's storm drain system, waste treatment system, culinary
water system, and solid waste collection system are interrelated services that are part of a unified City
plan to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the City and its residents in an environmentally
35-37 Ordinance No. 20-01, dated 1/2/2020.
Page 24-18
responsible manner. Therefore, the Storm Drain Utility fee shall be included on the City's regular monthly
utility bill for any given property. If there is no regular utility bill for the property, the Storm Drain Utility fee
shall be charged to the owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the City by
the person or entity paying for the City utility services provided to the property. All properties shall be
charged the fee, regardless of whether or not the owner or occupant of the property requests the Storm
Drain Utility services. Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of other utility
services. The Storm Drain Utility fee shall, from time to time, be set by resolution.
B. Non-single family residential parcels will be assessed a fee based on the actual amount of
impervious surface on the parcel. Single family residential parcels will all be assessed a common fee,
based on the average amount of impervious surface area found on single family residential parcels in the
City. The City Council finds that the common fee for single family residential parcels is justified because of
the following:
1. Each single family residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm
water runoff, and;
2. It would be impractical and difficult to administer the utility if each single family residential
parcel were measured individually.
C. The City Council finds ESUs to be of the most accurate measurement for determining the
amount that each parcel contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the Storm Drain Utility. The City
Council establishes the amount of impervious surface included in each ESU to be equal to the average
amount of impervious surface found on single family residential parcels. Therefore, each single family
residential parcel will pay the fee for one ESU.
Chapter 24.06. Storm Drainage. 8
24.06.010. Obstruction.
A. It is unlawful for any person to obstruct or contribute to the obstruction of the flow of storm

24.06.040. Damaging Storm Water System Prohibited.43
Any person who damages, breaks, defaces, or uncovers any portion of a storm water system
shall be responsible for the repair and/or replacement of any damaged portion of that line and any
connecting lines. Repairs shall be made as per the specifications in the Public Work Standards. It is
unlawful to remove any part or portion of the storm drain lines or any lines connecting to the storm drain
system without approval from the Director of Public Works or his designee.44

applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
24.06.080. Requirements for Approval of Connections.45
Connections are allowed for storm water runoff provided they (1) comply with subsection
24.06.090, (2) are approved by the City Engineer or Director of Public Works, and (3) connections are
documented on as-built plans provided to the City as required by Brigham City. Appropriate charges for
such hookups shall be established by resolution adopted by the City Council.46
24.06.090. Best Management Practices.47
Any person connecting to the storm water system or developing a commercial or industrial site
shall employ Best Management Practices (BMPs) approved by the City. The BMPs may be structural
and/or non-structural, depending on the needs of the site. The BMPs shall be designed to ensure that the
quality and quantity of storm water released to the City’s storm water system meets the requirements of
federal, state and local laws and regulations and the City’s UPDES permit, and will not exceed the
designed capacity of the storm water system or jeopardize the integrity of the storm water system.48
24.06.100. Easements.
The Director of Public Works or his designee shall be permitted to enter all private properties
through which the City holds an easement for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair, maintenance, or any portion of the storm drain facilities lying within the easement, or the
performance of any other duties pertinent to the operation of the storm drain. All entry and subsequent
work, if any, on an easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the easement pertaining
to the private property involved.
41-47 Ordinance No. 20-01, dated 1/2/2020.
Page 24-20
24.06.110. Authority to Inspect.
A. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any provision of this Article, or
whenever the City has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises
any condition which constitutes a violation of this Article, the City may enter such premises at all
reasonable times to inspect the same and to inspect and copy records related to storm water compliance.
In the event the owner or occupant refuses entry after a request to enter and inspect has been made, the
City is hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such
entry.
B. A long-term storm water management agreement is required for all storm water features and
controls located on private property when a project is vested subsequent to the effective date of this
Ordinance. Said management agreement shall be promulgated in the form and manner as determined by
the Public Works Director so long as the agreement includes at a minimum: a) allows the City oversight
authority of the storm water measures, b) a provision that the agreement acts as a covenant that runs
with the land, c) allows the City to perform necessary maintenance or corrective actions neglected by the
owner/operators or the qualified third party, and d) allows the City to recoup the costs from the
owner/operator as necessary to cover the expenses for necessary actions conducted by the City.49
C. The City interprets this regulation as secondary and subservient to the United States
Constitution and the Utah State Constitution as applied to property rights, land use, development, and
similar rights. Specifically, the intent of this regulation is not to be applied to violate vested property rights
nor to be a physical invasion of property rights as determined by the United States Supreme Court in
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). The City recognizes that the
United States Supreme Court interprets property rights in conjunction with the laws and constitutions of
each state. Therefore, Utah law also plays an important role in defining property rights. For the purpose
of determining when a property right is vested, the City shall continue to apply the Utah Supreme Court
ruling in Western Land Equities, Inc. V. City of Logan, 617 P.2d 388 (1980) that states a property owner is
vested to follow the City’s regulations in effect at the time a land use application is filed. Furthermore,
where there is vagueness in any land use regulation, including the storm water regulations, it shall be
interpreted in favor of the property owner.50
24.06.120. Requirement to Monitor and Analyze.
A. The City requires that any person engaged in any activity and/or owning or operating any
facility which is suspected of causing or contributing to storm water pollution, illegal discharges and/or
non-storm water discharges to the storm drain system or waters of the United States, to undertake at said
person’s expense such monitoring and analyses and furnish such reports to the City as deemed
necessary to determine compliance with this Article.
B. If City tests or inspections indicate that a site is causing or contributing to storm water
pollution, illegal discharges, and/or non-storm water discharges to the storm water system or waters of
the United States, and if the violations continue after notice from the City, the City may require any person
engaged in the illicit activity and/or the owner of operator of the site to provide, at their own expense,
monitoring and analyses required by the City to determine compliance with this Article.51
24.06.130. Enforcement Procedures.52
Whenever the City finds that a person, organization, or institution (not to exclude the County,
State, or Federal government) has violated a prohibition or failed to comply with a requirement of this
Chapter, the City will order compliance by the following procedure:
A. A verbal warning shall be given. The verbal warning shall be documented by the qualified
person (code enforcement officer, city inspector, public works employee) who issued the warning. The
City may skip the requirements set forth in this paragraph and immediately proceed with other more
severe actions against the violator if:
1. The violator has committed the same violation in the past, or
2. The violation, in the opinion of the City, creates a serious risk to persons, the
environment or property, or

2. If, as the result of the violation of any provision of this Chapter, the City or any other party
suffers damages and is required to make repairs and/or replace any materials, the cost of repair and/or
replacement shall be borne by the violating party and shall be in addition to any criminal or civil fines
and/or penalties.
3. Violators of this Chapter may also be subject to prosecution, fines and penalties from the
State of Utah and the United States EPA.
4. The Small MS4 General UPDES Permit, Permit No. UTR090000 defines the maximum
penalties for violations of Permit conditions as follows:
a. The General UPDES Permit provides that any person who violates a Permit condition
implementing provisions of the Act is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of such

knowingly renders inaccurate, any monitoring device or method required to be maintained under this
Permit shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 per violation, or by
imprisonment for not more than six months per violation, or by both.
5. A stop work order may be issued upon the discovery of work being conducted without a
required Permit. The stop work order may be issued by inspectors in the Public Works Department,
Building Inspection Department, or Code Enforcement. No construction activity may be commenced or
continued on any site for which a Permit has been absent, revoked, or suspended until the Permit has
been obtained, reissued, or reinstated, respectively.53
24.06.140. Compliance with Federal and State Laws.
Nothing contained in this Article is intended to relieve any person or entity from any obligation to
comply with applicable Federal and State Laws and Regulations pertaining to clean water and/or storm
water runoff.

including a State-issued Notice of Intent, shall be required for all sites 1) disturbing one acre or greater,
and 2) that are less than one acre that are part of a common plan of development. The SWPPP shall
contain, but not be limited to, the following information. (For complete requirements, see the General
Permit for Construction Activities, UTR300000 which can be found on the Utah Department of
Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality’s website.)
1. Site Description. A site description (including a map with spot elevations and contour
lines) which includes a description of the nature and location of the construction activity, a description of
the intended sequence of major activities which will disturb soils for major portions of the site (e.g.
grubbing, excavation, grading, utilities, and infrastructure installation, etc.), and estimates of the total area
of the site and the total area of the site that is expected to be disturbed by excavation, grading, or other
activities;
2. Control Description. A description of the proposed measures and controls that will be
implemented during construction activity and/or while the site is not stable. The Plan must clearly
describe the times during the construction process that the measures will be implemented for each major
activity identified pursuant to subsection (1). The Plan shall also state the name and phone number of
the person or entity responsible for implementation of each control measure.
C. Goals and Criteria. The proposed measures and controls described in the Plan shall be
designed to meet the following goals and criteria:
1. Prevent or Minimize Discharge. The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to
prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the discharge of sediment, debris and other
construction-related pollutants from the construction site by storm water runoff into the storm drainage
system.
2. Prevent or Minimize Construction Debris. The proposed measures and controls shall be
designed to prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the deposit, discharge, tracking by
construction vehicles, or dropping of mud, sediment, debris or other potential pollutants onto public
streets and rights-of-way. Any such discharge shall be cleaned up and removed immediately upon
notification to the Permittee or when it otherwise comes to the attention of the Permittee. At a minimum,
the deposit or discharge shall be cleaned and removed at the end of the work shift in which the deposit
occurred, or at the end of the workday, whichever comes first.
3. BMPs. The proposed measures and controls shall consist of Best Management Practices
(BMPs) available at the time that the Plan is submitted. BMPs may include, but shall not be limited to,
temporary silt or sediment fences, sediment traps and detention ponds, gravel construction entrances and

temporary grasses and permanent vegetative cover, use of straw mulch as a temporary ground cover,
erosion control blankets, temporary interceptor dikes and swales, storm drain inlet protection, check
dams, pipe slope drains, rock outlet protection, reinforced soil retaining systems, and gabions.
4. Stabilization. The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to preserve existing
vegetation, where possible. Disturbed portions of the site shall be stabilized. Stabilization practices may
include temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer
strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures. Use of
impervious surfaces for stabilization should be avoided. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon
Page 24-24
as practicable in disturbed portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or
permanently ceased, but in no case more than 14 days after the construction activity in that portion of the
site has temporarily or permanently ceased, except under the following circumstances:
a. If the initiation of stabilization measures by the 14th day after construction activity
temporarily or permanently ceases is precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization
measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or
b. If construction activity on a portion of the site is temporarily ceased, and earth
disturbing will resume within 21 days, temporary stabilization measures need not be initiated on that
portion of the site.
5. Minimize Risk of Discharge of Other Materials. The proposed measures and controls shall
be employed to minimize the risk of discharge of construction-related pollutants (such as paint, thinners,
solvents and other chemicals) from the construction site. Such measures may include implementation of
storage practices to minimize exposure of the material to storm water as well as spill prevention and
response.
D. Plan. Plan shall be defined as the Erosion Control Plan or Storm Water Pollution Prevention

Chapter 25.06. Cluster Subdivision Option.
25.06.010. Purpose.
The Cluster Subdivision Option (“CSO”) is provided to allow for subdivisions with clustering
of lots with lot sizes smaller than that required by the Zoning District in which the property is located.
However, the total number of lots allowed shall not exceed that allowed by the Zoning District. See
Figure 25.06.010 Cluster Subdivisions at the end of this Chapter.
25.06.020. Intent.
A. A CSO is intended to provide subdivisions and accompanying lot configurations that
demonstrate desirable subdivision features including:
1. Protections for sensitive, agricultural, and other lands.
2. Provisions for the long-term conservation of open spaces and agricultural use areas.
3. Provisions for trails, trailheads, and other necessary public access locations to trails.
4. Cost efficiencies in subdivision development and maintenance, including the amount and
location of required infrastructure, including roads and streets, and other required utilities
and services.
B. A CSO is not provided and is not intended in any way to provide a mechanism to achieve
increased residential density benefits above that provided by the applicable Zoning
District.
25.06.030. Allowed Uses and Development Standards.
The allowed uses and all other development standards shall be as provided by the Zoning
District in which the Subject Property is located and this Ordinance.
25.06.040. Applicable Zoning Districts.
A CSO shall only be considered by the Land Use Authority for property located in the A-5, A-
1, RR-5, RR-1, R-1-40, R-1-20, R-1-12, and R-1-10 Zoning Districts.
25.06.050. Lot Size and Requirements.
In no event shall any lot in a CSO be less than:

C. That required to comply with all development standards (including those for primary
buildings and structures and accessory buildings and structures) required by the Zoning
District in which the Subject Property is located.
D. That required to meet the minimum setback requirements of the Zoning District in which
the Subject Property is located and to provide a building envelope of sufficient size, as
recommended by the Commission and approved by the Land Use Authority. For the
purposes of a CSO, the required lot frontage may be modified, as recommended by the
Commission and approved by the Land Use Authority.
25.06.060. Maximum Number of Lots and Future Divisions.
A. The number of lots proposed for a CSO, and approved by the Land Use Authority, shall
not be more than the maximum number of lots allowed by the Zoning District in which the
property is located. (To calculate the maximum number of lots allowed, the total number
of acres of the Subject Property shall be divided by the minimum lot size required by the
Zoning District in which the property is located, rounded to the nearest and lowest whole
number.) Example: Total Subject Property = 5.9 acres located in an RR-1 Zoning District
(requiring a minimum lot size of 1 acre). 5.9 Acres/1 unit per acre = 5.0 Total Lots
possible.
B. As provided by this Ordinance, property subdivided under these provisions shall be
accompanied by a note on the Lot and Parcel Number and on the Final Subdivision Plat that
the resulting lots, including any portion of the original property parcel, may not be further
subdivided without the approval and recordation of a new Final Plat or an amended Final Plat
with the effect of modifying the existing Final Plat.
C. All other standards and requirements provided by this Ordinance shall apply and shall be in
full force and effect, including the requirements of Chapter 25.07.

open spaces and areas proposed to continue as agricultural use.
B. Areas of open space or land to continue for agricultural use may be identified as a separate
lot or included within one or more lots.
C. Open space and agricultural use areas should be contiguous to provide for large and

This Chapter provides standards for individual atypical subdivision street designs and lot

Use Authority, as applicable, when the more accepted and standard street designs and lot
configurations are determined to be either impractical or against the best interests of the City.
25.08.020. Connectivity – Applicable General Plan Policy.
Consistent with the policies of the City’s General Plan, as adopted, the City has a clear priority
that all new roads, streets, and other rights-of-way provide connections to either existing or proposed
roads, streets, and other rights-of-way. These connections should include active transportation
(pedestrian and bicycling) and vehicle movements. Undeniable support for the requirement that all roads,
streets, and other rights-of-ways be connected is found in the General Plan goal and strategy statements.
For example, “City fathers (leaders) allowed for the layout of a highly connected City street system that
serves to enhance the efficiency and livability of Brigham City’s transportation network. A well-planned
grid system of roads offers a community multiple routes for arriving at a destination and allows users of all
modes (driving, biking, walking) more direct travel routes. Good connectivity also serves to disperse
traffic. During the (general plan) process, many citizens voiced their appreciation and preference for wellconnected
roads. They expressed their desire to institute policies that would increase connectivity in
areas where it is lacking, as well as policies that require future development to conform to connected gridlike
patterns” (General Plan, 2017, pp. 50-51).
25.08.030. Road, Street, and Right-of-Way Connectivity Required.
A. All new roads, streets, or other rights-of-way, whether proposed to be dedicated to the City or
to remain private, shall provide connections to the City’s existing road, street, and right-ofway
network and be found to be consistent with the City’s General Plan, including its plans,
goals, and strategies.
B. Cul-de-sacs Prohibited, Limited Exception. Any cul-de-sac, whether proposed to be
dedicated for public use or to be private shall be prohibited after the effective date of this
Ordinance unless allowed by Section 25.08.040.
C. Stub Streets Required and Allowed. To implement the road, street, and right-of-way
connectivity policies of the General Plan, and when future property and subdivision
connections are required, or desired, stub streets may be required. All stub streets shall meet
the design requirements of the City’s Public Works Standards for Development, Design, and
Construction, as adopted.
25.08.040. Limited Exception to Section 25.08.030(B).
A cul-de-sac proposed after the effective date of this Ordinance may be allowed if the Land Use
Authority finds a special or unique circumstance and compelling evidence to support all the following:
A. No potential exists in the future for any road, street, or right-of-way connection;
B. No goal or strategy of the General Plan will be compromised nor any other policy of the City
adversely affected; and
C. Circumstances exist that benefit the City to not require a future road, street, or right-of-way
connection.
Page 25-41
D. Notwithstanding the preceding exception standards, nonmotorized connections for active
transportation, and facilities, may be required.
E. In addition to the findings required by the Land Use Authority, as provided by this Section, no
allowed cul-de-sac shall exceed the maximum length or the maximum number of lots or
dwelling units, as provided by Chapter 25.14.

26.01.020. Findings and Declaration of Policy.
The Council finds and declares that the use of any swimming pools by a substantial number of
people is a factor in the transmission of disease and in the occurrence of accidents causing bodily injury
or death to human beings unless such pools are constructed, operated and maintained in accordance
with proper minimum standards of engineering and sanitation. It is the policy and intent of the city to
protect the public health and safety by requiring that all swimming pools in the city, insofar as possible,
shall meet proper minimum standards of safety and sanitation designed and adapted to minimize the
possibility of accidental injury and the transmission of disease through the medium of such pools or the
common use thereof. The Council further finds and declares that these objectives can be achieved only
through regulation and control of the design, construction, maintenance and operation of such pools.

application and the plans and specifications and explanatory data shall be promptly reviewed by
Community Development and if applicable the health department. The health department shall promptly
advise Community Development in writing of its approval or disapproval thereof and if the same are
disapproved it shall indicate briefly the reason for such disapproval. Community Development shall also
review such plans and specifications and if it appears that the same comply with all applicable ordinances
and regulations and if the same are approved by the health department as complying with ordinances and
regulations relating to health, sanitation and safety, the permit shall be issued. Otherwise the permit shall
be refused and the applicant advised of the reason therefor.
26.01.070. Failure to Follow Approved Plans.
It is unlawful to construct, alter, remodel or enlarge any swimming pool in any manner which
varies in any substantial or material particular from the plans and specifications approved by Community
Development for which a permit has been issued.

such street, in which event the City shall pay the difference in cost between the size of pipe needed by
the applicant and that specified by the Water Supervisor; provided further, that all costs of installing the
pipe to the place of the applicant, which has been paid by the applicant, shall be entered as a credit upon
the account of the applicant and all water bills thereafter charged for the use of water shall be charged

shall be considered the property of the City.
The credit allowed a property owner on water charges, as provided in this section, shall be limited
to a term of five years from the date of the installation of the original connection to the property.
Thereafter the property owner, or his successor in interest, shall pay the regular charges for all water

whichever is closer.
28.02.040. Permitted Uses.
The following uses shall be allowed within the groundwater protection zones:
A. All Zones.
1. Uses established before the effective date of this ordinance and used continuously and in
the same manner thereafter, which uses may continue, subject to Section 28.02.050 of this ordinance,
provided any such use is not judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be a nuisance under the
provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations.
2. Uses of single or multiple-family residential dwellings, commercial or institutional uses
established on or after the effective date of this ordinance connected to a sanitary sewer system.
3. Uses incidental and accessory to the uses set forth in the two immediately preceding

29.01.010. Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Brigham City Zoning Ordinance” and may
be identified within this document and other documents as “the Ordinance,” “this Ordinance” “Zoning
Ordinance,” or “Land Use Ordinance.” This Ordinance shall be considered and may be identified as a
Brigham City Land Use Ordinance, as defined by the Act.
29.01.020. Purpose.
This Title is designed and enacted for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals,
convenience, order, prosperity and welfare of the present and future inhabitants of Brigham City, Utah,
including among other things, the lessening of congestion in the streets, or roads, securing safety from fire
and other dangers, providing adequate light and air, classification of land uses and distribution of land
development and utilization, protection of the tax base, securing economy in governmental expenditures,
fostering the agricultural and other industries, and the protection of urban development. The Land Use
Ordinance is intended to carry out the goals and policies of the General Plan.

corporate limits of the City.

Page 29.01-2
29.01.050. Conflict. 2
A. Conflict with Other Local Regulations. This Title shall not nullify the more restrictive provisions
of covenants, agreements or other titles or laws, but shall prevail notwithstanding such provisions which are
less restrictive.
B. Conflict with State or Federal Regulations. If the provisions of this Title are inconsistent with
those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision shall prevail, to the extent permitted
by law.
C. Conflict with Private Restrictions. It is not the intent of this Title to interfere with, abrogate or
annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between private parties. If the
provisions of this Title impose a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of
this Title shall prevail. If the provisions of a private agreement impose a greater restriction than this Title, the
provisions of the private agreement shall prevail. Brigham City does not enforce private covenants.
D. Conflict with Development Agreements. To the extent there is an inconsistency between this
Title and a development agreement, the development agreement shall prevail. If the provisions of the
development agreement are inconsistent with those of the state and federal government, the more
restrictive provision shall prevail, to the extent permitted by law.
1. A development agreement may be negotiated and executed between a developer and the
City to set forth the specific requirements, elements and any other aspects of a development, including
vesting of zoning and uses, aesthetic standards and requirements.
2. The City Council has the sole authority to approve a development agreement. The Council
may request a review and recommendation from the planning commission regarding the land use
provisions of the development agreement.
3. All development agreements, upon proper execution, shall be recorded with the Box Elder
County Recorder’s Office, shall run with the land, and shall be binding on any subsequent owners,
successors or assigns of the person entering into the agreement.
E. Severability. The chapters, parts, sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and phrases of
this Title are hereby declared to be severable. If any chapter, part, section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this Title is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, or deleted through amendment or
repeal, such invalidation or deletion shall not affect the remaining parts of this Title.
29.01.060. Prohibitions.
A. No lot may be sold, transferred, financed, or otherwise exchanged unless and until it has been
created in conformance with the provisions of this Title and stated law.
B. No land, building, or structure may be developed, used, occupied, erected, moved or altered
without conformance with the provisions of this Title and state law.
29.01.070. General Plan Mandate.
Land development shall be consistent with the General Plan. The City’s administration and its
departments shall carry out the mandate of the General Plan when reviewing project proposals, and
development plans.
A. Planning Commission Implementation - The Planning Commission shall not approve any
project for which it cannot substantiate a finding that the project is consistent with the goals, policies and
implementation programs of the General Plan.
B. Appeal Authority Implementation - The Appeal Authority shall not approve any variance
request for which it cannot substantiate a finding that the project is consistent with the goals, policies and
implementation programs of the General Plan.
C. Relationship of the General Plan to the Land Use Ordinance - The General Plan is the adopted
policies of the Brigham City Council. The General Plan represents a lengthy public participation process
and incorporates long range goals, identified polices, and an implementation program. The content of the
General Plan may be cited as a basis for making decisions or as a part of the finding to support actions
initiated by this Land Development Code. The General Plan is adopted as a part of this code by
reference. The General Plan provides the policies that enable the specific regulations of the Land
Development Code to be carried out. Implementation measures in the General Plan provide direction for
specific measures within the Land Development Code. When there is a conflict between the General Plan
and the Land Development Code, if the General Plan provides precise development standards, the
2 Ordinance No. 08-20, dated 11/20/08
Page 29.01-3
General Plan is to be used. If the General Plan provides policy language and no specific development
standards, the Land Development Code’s specific measures are to prevail.
29.01.080. Effect on Previous Titles and Maps.
The existing titles covering zoning, in their entirety, and including the maps heretofore adopted
and made a part of said titles are hereby superseded and amended to read as set forth herein; provided,
however, that this Title, including the attached map, shall be deemed a continuation of previous titles and
not a new enactment, insofar as the substance of revisions of previous titles is included in this Title, whether
in the same or in different language; and this Title shall be so interpreted upon all questions of construction
relating to tenure of officers and boards established by previous titles and to questions of conforming or
nonconforming uses and buildings and structures, and to questions as to the dates upon which such uses,
buildings, or structures became conforming or nonconforming.
29.01.090. State and Federal Property.

29.01.110. Building Permit Required.
The construction, alteration, repair, or removal of any building, structure, or part thereof as provided

not started within one year will require a new permit.
29.01.120. Occupancy Permit Required
Land, buildings or premises in any district shall hereafter be used only for a purpose permitted in
such district and in accordance with district regulations. A permit or occupancy shall be issued by the
Building Division to the effect that the use, building or premises will conform to provisions of this and related
titles prior to occupancy, for any building erected, enlarged or altered structurally, or the occupancy or use
of any land, except for permitted agricultural uses. Such a permit is needed whenever use or character of
any building or land is to be changed. Upon written request from the owner, a permit shall be issued
covering any lawful use of buildings or premises existing on the effective date of this amendment, including
nonconforming buildings and uses.
29.01.130. Site Plans Required.

Page 29.01-4
to determine compliance with zoning title provisions. The Community Development Department or any
authorized employee of the City shall use the right to enter any building for the purpose of determining the
use, or to enter premises for the purpose of determining compliance with the said Title, provided that such
right of entry is to be used only at reasonable hours. In no case shall entry be made to any occupied building
in the absence of an owner or tenant thereof without written permission of an owner, or written order of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
29.01.150. Completion of Requirement Improvements.
A. For uses subject to Chapters 29.06, 29.24, or 29.25, any improvements required under this
Title, including but not limited to, curb, gutter, sidewalk, fences, landscaping, streets, parking, and flood
control requirements shall be satisfactorily installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the
Building Division, or if a certificate of occupancy is not required, prior to the issuance of a business license
for the land being developed. In lieu of actual completion of such improvements prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy or business license, a developer may file with the City Council a cash bond, surety
bond, letter of credit, or escrow agreement in an amount specified by the City Engineer to ensure
completion of such improvements within one year. The bond may be extended by the City Council upon
request. Upon completion of the improvements for which a bond or escrow agreement has been filed, the
developer shall call for inspections of the improvements by the Community Development Department. Upon
approval of the City Council following a recommendation of the Planning Commission, and in lieu of the
bond requirements of this Section, the builder or developer may be permitted to execute an agreement in a
form acceptable to the City’s Attorney’s Office, deferring any of the required improvements.
B. Inspection shall be made within a reasonable time upon request. If the inspection shows the
City standards and specifications have been met in the completion of such improvements, the bond or
agreement shall be released within a reasonable time from the time of inspection. If the bond agreement is
not released, refusal to release and the reasons therefore shall be given to the developer in writing within a
reasonable time from the time of the inspection. The bond may be partially released based upon the
percentage of completion of the required improvements.
C. If the City Council determines that the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or a business
license prior to completion of any required improvements may be injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of
the City or its inhabitants, it may refuse to accept a bond or deferral agreement in lieu of actual completion
of required improvements or may limit the bond or agreement to a period of less than one year.
29.01.160. Enforcement.
The Community Development Department is authorized as the enforcing officer for this Title, and
shall enforce all provisions, entering actions in court if necessary, and his failure to do so shall not legalize
any violations of such provisions. The governing body may, by resolution or title, from time to time entrust
administration of this Title, in whole or in part, to another officer of the local jurisdiction, without amendment
to this Title.
29.01.170. Nuisance and Abatement.

a public nuisance; and the local attorney shall, upon request of the governing body, at once commence
action or proceedings for abatement and removal of enjoinment thereof in a manner provided by law, and

Page 29.01-5

or authority to issue permits or licenses shall conform to the provisions of this Title and shall issue no permit
or license for uses, buildings, or purposes where the same would be in conflict with the provisions of this
Title and any such permit or license, if issued in conflict with the provisions of this Title, shall be null and

and which the Appeal Authority has granted on an almost routine basis. The specific types of decisions
the Community Development Director or designee is authorized to make shall include:
1. Determination of a nonconforming use which can be verified by substantial evidence.
Substantial evidence, for the purpose of this Section, shall mean official documents, including any written

may establish the truth of the matter asserted by the applicant.

than that immediately preceding the proposed use.

D. Appeals to the Appeal Authority. Appeals may be made to the Appeal Authority by the City,
the applicant, or any other person or entity adversely affected by a zoning decision administering or

1. The appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days of the action or decision being appealed
from by filing a notice of appeal with the Appeals Authority with the Community Development Department.
2. The notice of appeal shall specify the grounds for the appeal and circumstances related
thereto. The notice shall allege that there was error in the order, requirement, decision, or determination
made by an official or officials in the administration or interpretation of the zoning ordinance. A notice
failing to allege such error or specifying the grounds for appeal may be summarily dismissed by the
Appeals Authority with or without prejudice. Response to the above requirements shall be set forth in
detail in the notice of appeal. The person or entity making the appeal shall have the burden of proving
that an error has been made.
3. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was made shall
be transmitted to the Appeals Authority.
4. The Appeals Authority shall set the appeal for hearing to be held within a reasonable time
from the date the appeal is received. Written notice of the date set for hearing the appeal shall be mailed
to the applicant at least seven days before the appeal hearing date. After hearing the appeal, the Appeals
Authority may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought
to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer or body from which the appeal is
made.
5. The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings and actions in furtherance of the matter
appealed, pending a decision of the Appeals Authority. Said stay shall exist unless the Planning
Commission or Community Development Director or designee certifies to the Appeals Authority, after the
notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by
restraining order which may be granted by the District Court on application, notice, and due cause shown.
6. The concurring vote of three members of the Appeals Authority shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any administrative official, planning
commission, or agency, or to decide in favor of the appellant.
7. The City, or any person adversely affected by any decision of the Appeals Authority, may
petition the district court for a review of the decision, provided the petition is filed with the Court within
thirty (30) days after the Board’s decision is final. In the petition, the appealing party may only allege that
the Appeals Authority’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or illegal. The Appeal Authority may, after
finding that it is in the best interest of the City to do so, stay its decision pending district court review.
E. Variances.
1. Definitions. A variance is a device which grants a property owner relief from certain
provisions of the zoning ordinance when, because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the property, compliance would result in a particular hardship upon the owner,
as distinguished from a mere inconvenience or a desire to reduce financial difficulties.
2. Variance Criteria. Unless otherwise provided in this Title, the Appeals Authority may grant
a variance from the requirements of any provision of the zoning ordinance to the extent that such a grant
shall be consistent with the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding, the spirit of this Title must be
observed and substantial justice done. Further, a previous variance can never set a precedent. Each
case must be considered only on its individual merits. The Appeals Authority may grant a variance only if:
Page 29.04-4
a. Literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause an unreasonable hardship
for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general purpose of the zoning ordinance; and
b. There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not generally apply
to other properties in the same zoning district; and
c. Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial property right
possessed by other property in the same zoning district; and
d. The granting of the variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will not
be contrary to the public interest; and the spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed and substantial justice
done
3. In determining whether or not enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause
unreasonable hardship under this section, the Appeals Authority may not find an unreasonable hardship
unless the alleged hardship:
a. is located on or associated with the property for which the variance is sought; and
b. comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from conditions that are
general to the neighborhood.
4. In determining whether or not enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause
unreasonable hardship under this section, the Appeal Authority may not find unreasonable hardship if the
hardship is self-imposed or economic
5. In determining whether or not there are special circumstances attached to the property
under this section, the Appeal Authority may find that special circumstances exist only if the special
circumstances:
a. relate to the hardship complained of; and
b. deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in the same district.
6. The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions justifying a
variance have been met.
7. Variances, once granted, shall run with the land.
8. Use variances may not be granted by the Appeal Authority nor by any other body.
9. In granting a variance, the Appeal Authority may impose additional requirements on the
applicant that will:
a. mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
b. serve the same or similar purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived or
modified.
29.04.030. Administration of City’s Land Use Ordinances.

29.11.010. Purpose.
A. Multiple Use Districts. The purposes of providing a multiple use district are to establish areas
in mountain, hillside, canyon, mountain valley, desert, and other open and generally undeveloped lands
where human habitation would be limited in order to protect land and open space resources; to reduce
unreasonable requirements for public utility and service expenditures through uneconomic and unwise
dispersal and scatteration of population; to encourage use of the land, where appropriate, for forestry,
grazing, agriculture, mining, wildlife habitat, and recreation; to avoid excessive damage to watersheds,
water pollution, soil erosion, danger from brushland fires, damage to grazing, livestock raising, and to
wildlife values; and, to promote the health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare of
the inhabitants of the community.
1. M-U-40 Minimum Lot Size: Forty (40) acres
2. M-U-80 Minimum Lot Size: Eighty (80) acres
3. M-U-160 Minimum Lot Size: One hundred sixty (160) acres
B. Agricultural Districts. To promote and preserve in appropriate areas conditions favorable to
agriculture and to maintain greenbelt open spaces. These districts are intended to include activities
normally and necessarily related to the conduct of agriculture and to protect the district from the intrusion
of uses inimical to the continuance of agricultural activity.
1. A-1 Minimum Lot Size: One (1) acre
2. A-5 Minimum Lot Size: Five (5) acres
C. Rural Residential Districts. To promote and preserve in appropriate areas conditions
favorable to large-lot family life, the keeping of limited numbers of animals and fowl, and reduced
requirements for public utilities. These districts are intended to be primarily residential in character and
protected from encroachment by commercial and industrial uses.
1. R-R-1, Minimum Lot Size: One (1) acre
2. R-R-5, Minimum Lot Size: Five (5) acres
3. R-R-10, Minimum Lot Size: Ten (10) acres
29.11.020. Codes and Symbols.
In following Sections of this Chapter, uses of land or buildings which are allowed in the various
districts are shown as "permitted uses," indicated by a "P" in the appropriate column, or as "conditional
uses," indicated by a "C" in the appropriate column. If a use is not allowed in a given district, it is either
not named in the use list or it is indicated in the appropriate column by a dash, "-." If a regulation applies
in a given district, it is indicated in the appropriate column by a numeral to show the linear or square feet,
or acres required, or by the letter "A." If the regulation does not apply, it is indicated in the appropriate
column by a dash, "-."
Page 29.11-2
29.11.030. Uses.
No building, structure or land shall be used and no building or structure shall be hereafter
erected, structurally altered, enlarged or maintained in the multiple use, agricultural, or rural residential
districts except as provided in this ordinance.
A. Exception to yard requirements for public service structures. In the absence of a specific
approval from the Planning Commission to the contrary, public service structures shall be subject to yard
area requirements and setbacks. The Planning Commission may allow public service structures to be
located within the required yard areas specified in this Chapter upon the following findings:
1. The public service structure is needed for the efficient delivery of public services to the
subject property,
2. Location of the public service structure in the required yard area will be beneficial to the
subject property and will not result in undue public safety, aesthetic, or functional impacts on the subject
property or surrounding properties,
3. The public service structure is integrated functionally and aesthetically into the overall
design of the site, and
4. Location of the public service structure outside of the required yard area would be
impossible or impractical due to functional considerations or because of site specific limitations.1

29.11.040. Uses Not Listed.
The Community Development Director or designee shall have the authority to identify and
categorize unlisted uses within the listed permitted or conditional uses of this Chapter, based on a finding
of substantial similarity of character, origin and impact, etc., to a listed use, and when so categorized such
use shall thereafter be recognized and treated the same as a listed use. 2

subject property and will not result in undue public safety, aesthetic, or functional impacts on the subject
property or surrounding properties,
3. The public service structure is integrated functionally and aesthetically into the overall
design of the site, and
4. Location of the public service structure outside of the required yard area would be
impossible or impractical due to functional considerations or because of site specific limitations.3

Section, unless the chain link has interlocking opaque vinyl, which is pre-inserted into the mesh. A minimum twenty foot
(20’) wide planting strip shall be required between the multi-family dwelling and the property line. When a single-story
height multi-family building adjoins any single family residential use the planting strip can be reduced to ten feet (10’) after
ensuring there is no negative effect on the single family residence. Evergreen or deciduous trees shall be planted in the
planting strip to provide a buffer between the two uses. A tree planting plan shall be submitted to the City for review and
approval by the City Forester. The minimum tree size is two inch (2”) caliper for deciduous trees and an eight foot (8’)
height for evergreens. A fence or wall is not required along the adjoining property line in the required front yard setback. If
a fence or wall is installed along the property line in the required front yard setback it shall comply with the height and
location standards as referenced in the Regulations Governing Fences and Walls Section of this Title.
B. Recreation and Playground Areas: In any residential development with four (4) or more dwelling units on a
single parcel of land, there shall be provided usable recreation or playground areas outside of the front yard setback, with
a total minimum area of two thousand (2,000) square feet for three (3) dwelling units and two hundred and fifty (250)
additional square feet for each dwelling unit thereafter. The minimum width and length of any usable recreation or
playground area shall not be less than twenty feet (20’) unless a trail system is approved as part of the requirement by the
Community Development Manager or designee. The on-site, above grade storm drainage detention basin may count
toward a portion of the recreation area if the applicant provides sufficient evidence that the basin is safe for recreational
purposes and usable pertaining to the area, slope and landscape. All recreation and playground areas shall be accessible
by all dwelling units within the development. Pathways within the designated areas may be included in the calculation

purposes of this Section).
C. Landscaping: In multiple residential developments (two-family, three-family, four-family, multiple-family, group
or planned unit developments), all areas not covered by buildings, structures and parking, shall be landscaped and
maintained using an underground automatic irrigation system. Areas not covered by an approved building, required
parking trees or shrubs shall be covered by grass or another acceptable ground cover such as bark, wood chips or
decorative rocks. Dirt, weeds and similar materials are not considered acceptable ground cover. Each project shall submit
a complete landscaping plan to the City for review and approval by the City Forester. The landscaping plan shall include
at least one (1) tree per unit or as approved by the City Forester. The minimum tree size is two (2”) inch caliper for
deciduous trees and eight feet (8’) in height for evergreen trees. No species of trees or large shrub should be planted

29.13.010. Purpose.
A. General Commercial (GC) Zone: The purpose of this zone is to establish a district for a
combination of commercial, office, entertainment, retail, and service businesses and activities. The zone
is designed to allow a range of businesses with access from major streets. This zone is distinguished
from the Central Business District by the accommodation of uses that may generate a lower level of
pedestrian activity. A high level of quality is required in project design.1
B. Central Business District (CDB) Zone: The purpose of this zone is to establish a district for
retail, entertainment, service and heritage related businesses and activities that are intended to cultivate a
high level of pedestrian activity, and encourage both daytime and nighttime consumer activity. This zone
is also intended to protect the unique nature of the Brigham City downtown area. Regulations of this zone
are designed to provide a suitable environment for those commercial and service uses which are vital to
economic life, with an emphasis on retail, service, entertainment and heritage enterprises. A high degree
of quality is required in project design. Compatibility of new construction with existing architecture is
required.
29.13.020. Codes and Symbols.
In the following Section of this Chapter, uses of land or buildings which are allowed in the various
districts are shown as "permitted uses,” indicated by a "P" in the appropriate column, or as "conditional
uses,” indicated by a "C" in the appropriate column. If a use is not allowed in a given district, it is either
not named in the use list or it is indicated in the appropriate column by an “N”. No building, structure or
land shall be used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, structurally altered, enlarged or
maintained in the commercial districts except as provided in this ordinance.

C. No dwelling shall be erected to a height less than one (1) story above grade.
29.13.050. Protection of Residential Property.
A. Where a commercial development adjoins any residential zone or residential use, there shall
be provided along the adjoining property line a six foot (6’) solid fence or masonry wall. Chain link fencing
with slats is not considered a solid fence for purposes of this Section. A fence or wall is not required along
the adjoining property line in the required front yard setback. If a fence or wall is installed along the
property line in the required front yard setback it shall comply with the height and location standards as
referenced in the Regulations Governing Fences and Walls Section of this Title.
B. Where a multiple family residential development adjoins any single family residential use,
there shall be provided along the adjoining property line a six foot (6’) solid fence or masonry wall. Chain
link fencing with slats is not considered a solid fence or wall for purposes of this Section, unless the chain
link has interlocking opaque vinyl, which is pre-inserted into the mesh. A fence or wall is not required
along the adjoining property line in the required front yard setback. If a fence or wall is installed along the
property line in the required front yard setback it shall comply with the height and location standards as
referenced in the Regulations Governing Fences and Walls Section of this Title.
29.13.060. Landscaping.
Landscaped areas are used to frame and soften structures, to define site functions, to enhance
the quality of the environment, and to screen undesirable views. Landscaping should complement the
buildings and surroundings to make a positive contribution to the aesthetics and function of both the
specific site and the area. The following characteristics will need to be addressed in the design of each
commercial project:
A. Landscaped areas should generally incorporate planting utilizing a three tiered system; 1)
grasses and groundcover; 2) shrubs and vines; and 3) trees. Landscape design and construction should
Page 29.13-11
emphasize drought tolerant landscaping where possible.
B. All areas not covered by approved buildings and structures or required parking, must be
completely landscaped and maintained using an automatic irrigation system. All areas not covered by an
approved building, required parking, trees or shrubs shall be covered by grass or another acceptable
ground cover such as bark, wood chips, or decorative rocks. Dirt, weeds and similar materials are not
considered acceptable ground cover.
C. All required landscaping must be properly maintained.
D. Plant materials will be placed in a manner that avoids interference with project lighting or
restriction of access to emergency apparatus such as fire hydrants or fire alarm boxes. Landscaping
should preserve the clear view area defined in this Title.
E. Planting areas will be protected from vehicular and pedestrian encroachment by raised
planting surfaces, bumper guards, or the use of curbs.
F. Plants in containers or planter boxes are encouraged for areas adjacent to store fronts along
walkways provided that the containers or planter boxes do not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular circulation.
G. Vines and climbing plants integrated upon buildings, trellises, and perimeter walls are not
only attractive, but also help discourage graffiti and are encouraged in appropriate areas.
H. Existing mature trees, riparian corridors, and view sheds should be preserved and
incorporated into the project landscaping.
I. Storm drainage facilities should be incorporated into the landscape design and appear to be
a part of the overall project.
J. No species of trees or large shrub should be planted under overhead lines or over
underground utilities if its natural growth may interfere with the installation or maintenance of any public or
private utility.
K. A complete landscaping plan is considered part of an application for Site Plan review and
shall include the types and sizes of all planting materials. A minimum of one evergreen tree no less than
five feet (5’) in height or deciduous tree with no less than two inch (2”) caliper for every one thousand
(1,000) square feet of land not covered by an approved building or required parking. Each plan should
include a variety of planting materials and a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees.
1. For the purposes of this Section, if a fractional number is obtained in calculating the tree
requirement, the fraction will either be rounded up to a whole number if at point-five (.5) or greater or
disregarded if a t point-four (.4) or less.
2. The Planning Commission, upon receiving a recommendation by the City Forester, may
approve a modification to the number of required trees if the property owner seeking development
approval presents substantial evidence demonstrating that the modification, as determined by the
Planning Commission, should be approved based on one of the following reasons:
a. the strict application of the number of trees will result in an unreasonable hardship as
the result of shallow lot depth, irregular lot shape, unusual topography or other similar factors including
soil condition, tree spacing, or utility conflict; or
b. the proposed modification constitutes an innovative landscaping design which is
superior to the landscaping that would result from application of required standards.
If the Planning Commission grants a modification under this Subsection, ti shall make specific
findings justifying the modification.
3. Existing trees on the said property m ay count toward the requirement upon the City
Forester’s inspection and approval. Consideration includes the size, type, location and condition of the
tree(s).
L. Refer to 1100 South Corridor Design Guidelines, West Forest Street Design Guidelines and
West Forest Street Corridor Overlay, and the Historic Downtown Design Guidelines for specific landscape
requirements.
29.13.070. Special Provisions.
A. Any area outside of a building used for any activity other than off-street parking and loading
shall be completely enclosed within a solid fence or wall of a height sufficient to completely screen such
activity from the street or from adjoining parcels (chain link fencing with slats is not considered a solid
fence or wall for purposes of this Section).
B. All uses shall be conducted from enclosed buildings except automobile fuel or service
stations, carwashes, automobile and recreational vehicle sales, rental or lease, off-street parking and
loading, plant material nurseries, outdoor restaurants, and commercial recreation, unless otherwise
permitted by planned unit development or conditional use permit.
C. All uses shall be free from objectionable noise, hazards, or nuisances.
D. Properties located within the 1100 South Corridor, West Forest Street, and Historic
Downtown areas of the community are subject to established Design Guidelines.
Page 29.13-12
29.13.080. Uses Not Listed.
The Community Development Director or designee shall have the authority to identify and
categorize unlisted uses within the listed permitted or conditional uses of this Chapter, based on a finding
of substantial similarity of character, origin, and impact, etc., to a listed use, and when so categorized
such use shall thereafter be recognized and treated the same as a listed use.

29.15.010. Purposes.
A. To encourage and provide a means for effectuating desirable development through the use of
variations in siting, mixed land uses, and/or varied dwelling or other buildings.
B. To preserve the amenities and compatibility of P Districts by adoption of a general
development plan, showing proper orientation, desirable design character, and compatible land uses.
C. To provide for the orderly pre-planning and long-term development for a variety of uses of
large tracts of land which are under unified ownership or development control, so as to ensure that the
entire tract will provide an environment of stable and desirable character.
D. To give the developer reasonable assurance that sectional development plans prepared in
accordance with an approved general development plan will be acceptable to the local jurisdiction.
Sectional development plans shall include subdivision plans and/or planned unit development plans as
provided for in this Chapter.
E. To enable the adoption of measures providing for development of the surrounding area in
character compatible with the Planned District.
29.15.020. Standards and Requirements.
The following provisions shall apply in a P District, which District shall also be subject to other
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, except that where conflict in regulations occurs, the regulations
specified in this Chapter, or on a development plan approved pursuant to this Chapter, shall apply.
A. P Districts may be established on one or more contiguous parcels of land which are suitable
for, and of sufficient size, to be planned and developed in a manner consistent with the purposes and
objectives of this Chapter as determined by the Planning Commission. 1
B. No ordinance establishing a P District shall be adopted unless and until there is on file with
the local jurisdiction written consent of every property owner within such District at the time of adoption of
the Ordinance, agreeing:
1. That the owner will be bound by the conditions and regulations proposed and which will
be effective within the District, and
2. To record such written agreement with the County Recorder.
C. Before detailed studies of any P District development plans shall be undertaken by the
planning staff or the planning commission, there shall be on file with the local jurisdiction the written
request of all property owners within the proposed District that such detailed studies be made.
D. Standards for area, coverage, density, yard requirements, parking and screening for P
District uses shall be governed by the standards of the residential, commercial, or industrial zoning
districts most similar in nature and function to the proposed P District use(s), as determined by the
Planning Commission, and as modified by the approved general development plan. Standards for public
improvements shall be governed by applicable ordinances and laws. Exceptions to these standards by
the Planning Commission and by the governing body are possible, when these bodies find that such
exceptions encourage a desirable living environment and are warranted in terms of the total proposed
development or unit thereof.

29.15.030. Preliminary Development Plan Approval.
Procedure and Applications. Prior to the filing of a formal P District rezoning application, the
applicant shall submit a preliminary development plan for an approval in principle thereof by the Planning
Commission and the governing body.
The preliminary development plan and text shall be prepared and endorsed by a qualified urban
planner, with other professional assistance as required, and shall include the following information
presented in a general schematic fashion:
A. The topographic character of the land, and any major grading intended;
B. Proposed land uses, population densities, and building intensities;
C. Proposed circulation pattern indicating both public and private streets;
D. Proposed parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other open spaces;
E. A market analysis of proposed uses, if required by the Planning Commission, if the property
is not zoned for commercial purposes at the time of submittal of the preliminary development plan;
F. Delineation of the units to be constructed in progression, if any; and
G. Relation of the proposed development to future land use in surrounding area(s) and as
shown on the master plan.
29.15.040. Public Hearing - Optional.
A public hearing on the preliminary development plan may be held by the Planning Commission
and governing body. Approval in principle of the preliminary development plan shall be limited to the
general acceptability of the land uses proposed and their interrelationships, and shall not be construed to
endorse precise location of uses, configuration of parcels, or engineering feasibility, and such approval
shall not be construed as or deemed to be in any form or sense a commitment to approve any
subsequent formal rezoning application.
29.15.050. General Development Plan and Schedule Approval.
Together with the application for rezoning classification, the applicant shall submit the following
general development plan consisting of documents and supporting evidence, prepared and endorsed by
a qualified professional team, as required by the Planning Commission.
A. A sepia map with ten (10) prints of a survey of the property, showing existing features of the
property including specimen trees, structures, streets, easements, drainage channels, utility lines, and
existing land uses;
B. A sepia map with ten (10) prints of a general development plan which shall be in reasonable
conformance with the approved preliminary plan, showing as appropriate, all the information required on
the preliminary development plan; the approximate location and proposed density of dwelling units; nonresidential
building uses and intensities; and land use considered suitable for adjacent properties;
C. A schedule for the development of units to be constructed in progression and a description of
the design principles for buildings and streetscapes; tabulation of total number of acres in the proposed
project and the per cent thereof designated for the various uses; the number of dwelling units proposed
by type of dwelling unit of the P District; estimated non-residential population; proposed retail sales area
and economic justification; anticipated timing for construction of each unit; and standards for height, open
space, building intensity, population density, and public improvements proposed for each unit of
development whenever the applicant proposes an exception from standard zoning district or other
ordinance regulations governing development;
D. Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the land to effectuate the proposed
plan;
E. Engineering and other feasibility studies, as necessary; and
F. If the development or plan is to be approved in stages, each stage of development shall be
completed prior to proceeding to the next stage, or adequate performance guaranties be posted to insure
completion of each approved stage.
29.15.060. Findings Required.
The Planning Commission, after public hearing, may recommend the establishment of a P
District, and the governing body, after public hearings, may by ordinance establish a P District, provided
that both find that the facts submitted with the application and presented at the hearings establish that:
A. The proposed P District or a given unit thereof, can be substantially completed within two (2)
years of the establishment of the P District.
B. That each individual unit of development as well as the total development, can exist as an
independent unit capable creating an environment of sustained desirability and stability, or that adequate
assurance will be provided that such objective will be attained; and that the uses proposed will not be
detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not be
Page 29.15-3
achieved under other zoning districts;
C. That the streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated
traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network
outside the P District;
D. That commercial development can be justified economically at the locations proposed to
provide commercial facilities;
E. That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in coordination and
substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
F. That any exception from standard ordinance requirements is warranted by the design and
amenities incorporated into the general development plan, in accordance with adopted policy of the
Planning Commission and the governing body;
G. That the P District is in conformance with the Master Plan; and,
H. That existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the population and use densities
proposed.
29.15.070. Planning Commission and Governing Body's Action.
A. If, from the facts presented, the Planning Commission, or the governing body is unable to
make the necessary findings, the application shall be denied.
B. In taking action, the Planning Commission may deny the general development plan and
general development schedule as submitted, or may recommend approval of said plan and schedule to
the governing body, subject to specified amendments.
C. Upon application for rezoning of an area to a P District and recommendation of such rezoning
by the Planning Commission, the governing body shall hold a public hearing thereon as required by other
amendments to the zoning ordinance.
D. Changes of use or density of an approved general development plan shall be considered the
same as a change in the zoning map, and shall be made in accordance with the provisions for
amendments of the zoning ordinance.
E. If no development has occurred to effectuate a P District development within two (2) years
after the District is created, the Planning Commission shall review the action and determine whether or
not the continuation of a given P District is in the public interest. If the Planning Commission so
recommends, the governing body may order the area reverted to the original district from which it was
created, without a public hearing.
F. At the time of adoption of any ordinance establishing a P District, the governing body shall
make appropriate arrangements with the applicant to insure the accomplishment, at the scheduled times,
of the public improvements, public dedications, and grants of easement shown on the approved general
development plan. The P District shall be given an appropriate name, number of letter to identify it; and
the approved general development plan shall be adopted by reference and become a part of the zoning
ordinance.

29.18.010. Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for safe, orderly and beneficial development of property
within areas characterized by diversity of physiographic conditions and shown on the Brigham City Zoning
Map as Sensitive Areas Overlay Zone; to limit alteration of topography and reduce encroachment upon,
or alteration of, such areas. Physiographic conditions can be considered to include, but are not limited to,
slope of the land, natural drainage ways, wetlands, soil characteristics, potential landslide areas, faults
zones and wildfire hazard areas.
29.18.020. Regulations.
The type of regulation applicable to the land depends upon the classification in which the land is
placed, as provided in Section 29.18.050. If those regulations conflict with other regulations of Brigham
City’s Municipal Code, the more stringent of the two regulations shall govern.
29.18.030. Sensitive Areas Overlay Map.
A map showing the sensitive areas overlay which specifies critical areas within Brigham City
which, when proposed for development, must go through the process outlined in this Chapter. Properties
within this overlay may not be suitable for development or may only be suitable after mitigation of the
hazards associated with the specific site.
29.18.040. All developments(s) to be Considered a Conditional Use in Sensitive Areas.
Because of the environmental conditions existing within sensitive areas, all developments
proposed within an area determined to be a sensitive area shall be considered a conditional use and shall
be reviewed and considered consistent with the procedures for the review of a conditional use as
provided in Chapter 29.06 of this Title.
29.18.050. Land Classifications.
The following factors shall be used to determine the classifications of various lands and their
constraints to building and development on them:
A. Floodplain Corridor Lands: Lands with potential stream flow and flood hazard. The
following lands are classified as Floodplain Corridor lands:
1. All land contained within the one hundred (100) year floodplain as defined by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, in maps adopted by Brigham City Municipal Code.
1 Entire Title rewritten with Ordinance No. 07-17 dated 8/30/07.
Page 29.18-2
2. All land within the area defined as Floodplain Corridor land in maps adopted by the
Brigham City Council as provided for in Section 29.18.070(A)(2).
3. All lands which have physical or historical evidence of flooding in the historical past.
4. All areas within twenty feet (20’) (horizontal distance) of any creek designated for
Riparian Preservation in 29.18.050(B) and depicted as such on maps adopted by the Council as provided
for in 29.18.070(A)(2).
B. Riparian Preservation and Wetland Areas: The lands shown on the official maps as
Riparian Areas, These areas are identified as seventy-five feet (75’) from the stream centerline for
streams draining a basin of greater than one (1) square mile, and twenty-five feet (25’) from a stream that
drain areas of one (1) square mile or less. It also includes any areas identified as wetlands or riparian in a
Federal Section 404 Permit Process.
C. Erosive and Slope Failure Lands: Lands with potential erosion hazards. Erosive Lands and
Slope Failure Lands are lands that are subject to damage from erosion and slope failure, or defined as
erosion and slope failure lands on the Sensitive Area Overlay map (see Section 29.18.030) and have a
slope of twenty-five percent (25%) or greater.
D. Earthquake Fault and Hazard Lands: Lands with identified earthquake faults and areas
prone associated earthquake hazards such as debris flows, landslides, liquefaction, and rock falls, as
defined on the Sensitive Area Overlay map (see Section 29.18.030).
E. Wildfire Hazard Lands: Lands with potential of wildfire, as defined on the Sensitive Area
Overlay map (see Section 29.18.030).
F. Sever Constraint Lands: Lands with severe development limitations which generally limit
normal development. The following lands are classified as Severe Constraint Lands:
1. All areas which are within the floodway channels.
2. All lands with a slope greater the twenty-five percent (25%).
G. Classifications Cumulative: The above classifications are cumulative in their effect and, if
a parcel of land falls under two or more classifications, it shall be subject to the regulations of each
classification. Those restrictions applied shall pertain only to those portions of the land being developed
and not necessarily to the whole parcel.
29.18.060. Review of Proposed Development in Sensitive Areas.
The Community Development Department, prior to scheduling any application for a development
proposed to be located wholly or partially, within any sensitive area as identified by this Chapter, shall
receive comments and recommendations from City Departments and other reviewing agencies, as
applicable.
29.18.070. Development Standards for Floodplain Corridor Lands. 2
The flood hazard areas of Brigham City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause
an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed
or otherwise protected from flood damage.
A. Purpose: It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
B. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance
uses the following methods:
2 Ordinance No. 10-12, 8/19/10
Page 29.18-3
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood,
or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood
damage;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
C. Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall
be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most
reasonable application.
Alluvial Fan Flooding. Means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which
originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment
transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet
flow.
Area of Special Flood Hazard. Is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood
Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for

V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to
the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99,
AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters.
In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if
the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Means an official map of a community, on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood Insurance Study. Is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood
Boundary-Floodway Map.
Floodplain or Flood-Prone Area. Means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any

prevention and reduction.
Flood Protection System. Means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized,
appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to
reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs,
levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with
sound engineering standards.
Flood Proofing. Means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

b) directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
Levee. Means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in
accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to
provide protection from temporary flooding.
Levee System. Means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated
structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with
sound engineering practices.
Lowest Floor. Means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or
flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other

so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section
60.3 of the National Flood insurance Program regulations.
Manufactured Home. Means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
Page 29.18-5
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to
the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision. Means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two
or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Mean Sea Level. Means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
New Construction. Means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start
of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974,
whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain
management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
New Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision. Means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which
the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading
or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management
regulations adopted by a community.
Recreational Vehicle. Means a vehicle which is:
1. built on a single chassis;
2. 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
3. designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
4. designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Start of Construction. (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal
Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation;
or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure. Means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally
above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
Substantial Damage. Means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring
the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement. Means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start
of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage",
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official
and which are the minimum necessary conditions or
2. Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a "historic structure."
Variance. Is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this ordinance when specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. (For full requirements see Section 60.6
of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.).
Violation. Means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate,
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3),
(e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Water Surface Elevation. Means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of
1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains
Page 29.18-6
of coastal or riverine areas.
D. General Provisions.
1. Lands to Which this Ordinance Applies. The ordinance shall apply to all areas of special
flood hazard within the jurisdiction of
Brigham City.
2. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood
hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report
entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study” for Brigham City, dated September 29, 2010, with accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions
thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. Brigham City
automatically adopts all effective FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Studies, and all FEMA effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps.
3. Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be required to ensure
conformance with the provisions of this ordinance.
4. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
5. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate,
or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the
more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
6. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall
be considered as minimum requirements; liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and deemed
neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.
7. Warning and Disclaimer or Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this
ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased
by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
E. Administration.
1. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Mayor’s appointee is hereby appointed
the Floodplain Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this ordinance and other
appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain
management.

required.
e. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas
of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
f. Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating
Agency which is the Utah NFIP Coordinator, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
g. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse is maintained.
h. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Article 3,
Section B, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation data and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer
the provisions of Article 5.
i. When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain Administrator
Page 29.18-7
must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any
point within the community.
j. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH,
on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one
foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (Conditional
Letter of Map Revision).
3. Permit Procedures. Application for a Development Permit shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in
duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape
alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information
is required:
a. Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all new and substantially improved structures;
b. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be
flood proofed;
c. A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the
nonresidential flood proofed structure shall meet the flood proofing criteria of Article 5, Section B(2);

flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
h. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
i. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for
the proposed use;
j. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.
5. Variance Procedures.
a. The Appeal Authority as established by the community shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
b. The Appeal Authority shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
c. Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Authority may appeal
such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
d. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal
and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
e. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of
structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places,
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
f. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section C(2) of this
Article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
Page 29.18-8
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
g. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the
Appeal Authority may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purpose and objectives of this ordinance (Article 1, Section C).
h. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
i. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
j. Prerequisites for granting variances:
i. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
ii. Variances shall only be issued upon:
1) showing a good and sufficient cause;
2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and
3) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
iii. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that
the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation,
and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
k. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use
provided that:
i. the criteria outlined in Article 4, Section D(1)-(9) are met, and
ii. the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
F. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
1. General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are
required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
a. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
b. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods
and practices that minimize flood damage;
c. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage;
d. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding.
e. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
f. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters;
and,
g. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding.
2. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data
has been provided as set forth in (i) Article 3, Section B, (ii) Article 4, Section B(8), or (iii) Article 5,
Section C(3), the following provisions are required:
a. Residential Construction - new construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Article 4,
Section C(1)a., is satisfied.
b. Nonresidential Construction - new construction and substantial improvements of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including
Page 29.18-9
basement) elevated one (1) foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards
of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by
the Floodplain Administrator.
c. Enclosures - new construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
i. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
ii. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
iii. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
d. Manufactured Homes –
i. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood
damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
ii. Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved
within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home
park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or
above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
iii. Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's
FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either:
1) the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood
elevation, or
2) the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
e. Recreational Vehicles - Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within
Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
i. be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
ii. be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
iii. meet the permit requirements of Article 4, Section C(1), and the elevation and
anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
3. Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
a. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with Article 1, Sections B, C, and D of this ordinance.
b. All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Development Permit requirements of Article 3,
Section C; Article 4, Section C; and the provisions of Article 5 of this ordinance.
c. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other
proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions.18
Page 29.18-10
which is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Article
3, Section B or Article 4, Section B (8) of this ordinance.
d. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
e. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
4. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These
areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot (1’) above the highest adjacent grade at least as high
as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is
specified).
b. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures;
i. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot (1’)above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM
(at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or;
ii. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below
the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
c. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Article 4, Section C (1) a., are
satisfied.
d. Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
5. Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article
3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due
to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
a. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
b. If Article 5, Section E (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5.
c. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway
that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a
conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.
G. Penalties for Noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other
applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions)
shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof be fined not more
than $750.00 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Brigham City
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
29.18.080. Development Standards for Riparian Preservation Lands.
All development in areas identified for Riparian Preservation, as defined in Section 29.18.050,
shall comply with the following standards:
A. Development shall be subject to all Development Standards for Floodplain Corridor Lands
(see Section 29.18.070)
B. Within these areas in addition to the standards for Undeveloped Floodplains, no land
disturbing activity is allowed except as permitted in this section.
Page 29.18-11
C. Permitted Uses
1. Up to ten percent (10%) of the area may be disturbed for private yard structures including
but not limited to: storage sheds, gardens, yards, trails, and clearings, except no disturbance is permitted
for Section 404 Permit identified areas.

7. Measures to remove or abate nuisances, or any other violation of State statute,
administrative agency rule or Brigham City ordinance.
29.18.090. Development Standards for Erosive and Slope Failure Lands.
A. All development that removes vegetation or disturbs topsoil and leaves the disturbed soil at a
slope of fifty percent or more shall comply with the following standards:
1. Any exposed soil shall be revegetated in a manner to reestablish a vegetative community
within a on (1) year period from issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. If irrigation is not provided, then
the exposed soil must be planted with species that can survive without irrigation.
2. Vegetative cover, rock, dry or conventional masonry, or other permanent cover must be
maintained on areas that have been disturbed.
3. These restrictions shall not apply to areas of exposed bedrock which exhibit no erosion
potential.
B. Cuts and Fills.
1. In addition, any cuts and/or fills greater than two hundred fifty (250) cubic yards must be
designed by an engineer to comply with current Building Code. Such cuts and/or fills shall be designed in
such a manner that they will be stable for the use intended.
2. If the excavation is not a dedicated street or a public right-of-way, the engineer shall
declare to Brigham City, after the cut and/or fill is completed, that it was constructed to plans and meets
all standards set forth in the plans approved.
3. Nothing in this section shall abridge Brigham City’s right to inspect work in progress or in
its completed state, to make appropriate measurements and tests to determine if the cut and fill was
made according to plan, and to require alterations prior to final approval of the cut and/or fill.
C. Any development that is proposed in Erosive and Slope Failure Lands must be shown on a
master site plan at the time the final plan or plat is filed. All development must comply with the master site
plan. Any improvements necessary for the implementation of the master plan (e.g., storm drains, gutters,
etc.), which involve two or more parcels of land must be constructed by the applicant prior to any
development occurring on the parcels.
D. All structures in Erosive and Slope Failure Lands shall have foundations that have been
designed by an engineer or architect.
E. All newly created lots or lots modified by a lot line adjustment must include a building
envelope on all lots that contains a buildable area of sufficient size to accommodate the uses permitted in
the underlying zone without including erosive and slope failure land, unless the division or lot line
adjustment is for open space or conservation purposes.
29.18.100. Development Standards for Earthquake Fault and Hazard Lands.
For those areas identified as an active or potential mapped earthquake fault and landslide areas,
development may be permitted by the City upon the review and approval of an engineering geotechnical

A. Accurately identifying the location of earthquake faults and landslide areas.
B. The location and description of proposed changes to the site, including any grading and
excavation, vegetation removal, the location and profiles of proposed roadways, the location of proposed
utility lines, the location of existing and proposed buildings and structures, and the location of all other
proposed site features.
Page 29.18-12
C. The identification of measures and actions proposed to mitigate the risks from earthquake,
landslides, and soil disturbance including a schedule of the sequence for the installation of planned
mitigation actions, including anticipated starting and completion dates.
D. No critical facility (excluding transportation lines or utilities which by their nature) may cross
active faults or structures designed for human occupancy shall be built astride an active fault. No
structure designed for human occupancy shall be built on a fault scarp. Footing setbacks from a fault
scarp shall meet the requirements of the International Uniform Building Code. The Planning Commission
may increase footing setback requirements where information from a geotechnical report indicates a
slope condition warrant a greater setback distance.
29.18.110. Development Standards for Wildfire Hazards Lands.
A. Requirements for Subdivisions, or Planned Developments,
1. A Fire Prevention and Control Plan shall be required with the submission of any
application for plan approval of a Planned Unit Development or preliminary plat of a subdivision, which

d. A tree management plan showing the location of all trees that are to be preserved
and removed on each lot. In the case of heavily forested parcels, only trees scheduled for removal shall
be shown.
e. The areas of primary and secondary fuel breaks that are required to be installed
around each structure, as required by this section.
f. Roads and driveways sufficient for emergency vehicle access and fire suppression
activities, including the slope of all roads and driveways within the Wildfire Lands area.
4. Criteria for Approval. The land use authority shall approve the Fire Prevention and
Control Plan when, in addition to the findings required by this chapter, the additional finding is made that
the wildfire hazards present on the property have been reduced to a reasonable degree, balanced with
the need to preserve and/or plant a sufficient number of trees and plants for erosion prevention, wildlife
habitat, and aesthetics.
5. The land use authority may require, through the imposition of conditions attached to the
approval, the following requirements as deemed appropriate for the development of the property:
a. Delineation of areas of heavy vegetation to be thinned and a formal plan for such
thinning.
b. Clearing of sufficient vegetation to reduce fuel load.
c. Removal of all dead and dying trees.
d. Relocation of structures and roads to reduce the risks of wildfire and improve the
chances of successful fire suppression.
6. The Fire Prevention and Control Plan shall be implemented during the public
improvements required of a subdivision or Planned Unit Development, and shall be considered part of the
subdivider’s obligations for land development. The Plan shall be implemented prior to the issuance of any
building permit for structures to be located on lots created by partitions and for subdivisions or Planned
Unit Development not requiring public improvements. The Director of Emergency Services, or designee,
shall inspect and approve the implementation of the Fire Prevention and Control Plan, and the Plan shall
not be considered fully implemented until the Director of Emergency Services has given written notice to
the Community Development Department that the Plan was completed as approved by the land use
authority.
7. In subdivisions or planned unit developments, provisions for the maintenance of the Fire
Prevention and Control Plan shall be included in the covenants, conditions and restrictions for the
development, and Brigham City shall be named as a beneficiary of such covenants, conditions and
restrictions.
B. Requirements for construction of all structures.
Page 29.18-13
1. All new construction and any construction expanding the size of an existing structure,
shall have a “fuel break” as defined below.
2. A “fuel break” is defined as an area which is free of dead or dying vegetation, and has
native, fast-burning species sufficiently thinned so that there is no interlocking canopy of this type of
vegetation. Where necessary for erosion control or aesthetic purposes, the fuel break may be planted in
slow-burning species. Fuel breaks do not involve stripping the ground of all native vegetation.
3. Primary Fuel Break - A primary fuel break will be installed, maintained and shall extend a
minimum of thirty feet (30’) in all directions around structures, excluding fences, on the property. The goal
within this area is to remove ground cover that will produce flame lengths in excess of one foot. Such a
fuel break shall be increased by five feet (5’) for each ten percent (10%) increase in slope over ten
percent (10%).
4. Secondary Fuel Break - A secondary fuel break will be installed, maintained and shall
extend a minimum of one hundred (100’) feet beyond the primary fuel break where surrounding
landscape is owned and under the control of the property owner during construction. The goal of the
secondary fuel break is to reduce fuels so that the overall intensity of any wildfire is reduced through fuels
control.
5. All structures shall be constructed or re-roofed with Class B or better non-wood roofing
materials, as determined by the current Building Code. All re-roofing of existing structures in the Wildfire
Lands area shall be done under approval of a zoning permit. No structure shall be constructed or reroofed
with wooden shingles, shakes, wood-product material or other combustible roofing material, as
defined in the current Building Code.
C. Fuel breaks in areas which are also Erosive or Slope Failure Lands shall be included in the
erosion control measures outlined in Section 29.18.090.
29.18.120. Development Standards for Severe Constraint Lands.
A. Severe Constraint Lands are extremely sensitive to development, grading, filling, or
vegetation removal and, whenever possible, alternative development should be considered.
B. Development of floodways is not permitted except for bridges and road crossings. Such
crossings shall be designed to pass the one hundred year flood without raising the upstream flood height
more than six inches (6”).
C. New structures are not allowed on Severe Constraints Lands.
D. Other development of land or approval for a planning action shall be allowed only when the
following study has been accomplished. An engineering geologic study approved by the Brigham City
Engineer, Public Works Department and Community Development Department establishes that the site is
stable for the proposed use and development. The study shall include the following:
1. Index map.
2. Project description to include location, topography, drainage, vegetation, and discussion
of previous work and discussion of field exploration methods.
3. Site geology, based on a surficial survey, to include site geologic maps, description of
bedrock and surficial materials, including artificial fill, locations of any faults, folds, etc., and structural data
including bedding, jointing and shear zones, soil depth and soil structure.
4. Discussion of any off-site geologic conditions that may pose a potential hazard to the site,
or that may be affected by on-site development.
5. Suitability of site for proposed development from a geologic standpoint.
6. Specific recommendations for cut slope stability, seepage and drainage control or other
design criteria to mitigate geologic hazards.
7. If deemed necessary by the engineer or geologist to establish whether an area to be
affected by the proposed development is stable, additional studies and supportive data shall include
cross-sections showing subsurface structure, graphic logs with subsurface exploration, results of
laboratory test and references.
8. Signature and registration number of the engineer and/or geologist.
9. Additional information or analyses as necessary to evaluate the site.
29.18.130. Engineering Geotechnical Report.
A. The Engineering Geotechnical Report shall be prepared by a licensed geotechnical engineer
and licensed geologist. The report shall be signed and dated by the preparer and shall also include the
qualifications of the preparer.
B. The report shall be site-specific and identify all known or suspected potential geotechnical or
natural hazards, originating on-site or off-site, affecting the particular property.
Page 29.18-14
C. The report shall include a detailed site map (scale: one inch (1”) equals two hundred feet
(200’) or larger) showing the location of the hazard(s) with delineation of the recommended setback
distances from such hazards(s) and the recommended location for proposed structures.
D. The report shall address the potential effects of the hazard(s) on the proposed development
and occupants, thereof, in terms of risk and potential damage.
E. The report shall contain recommendations for avoidance or mitigation of the effects of the
hazard(s). The evidence on which the recommendations and conclusions are based shall be clearly
stated in the report. Trench logs (scale: one inch (1”) equals five feet (5’) or larger), aerial photographs,
references with citations, and other supporting information as applicable, shall also be included in the
report.
F. All Engineering Geotechnical Report submitted to the City shall be reviewed by the Utah
Geological Survey for completeness, accuracy, and appropriate recommendations.
29.18.140. Disclosure of a Natural Hazard by an Engineering Geotechnical Report.
Whenever a potential natural hazard is identified by a required geotechnical report under this
Chapter, the owner of such parcel shall record a restrictive covenant running with the land in a form
satisfactory to the City prior to the approval of any development or subdivision of such parcel which shall
include the following:
A. Notice of the existence and availability of the engineering geotechnical report that identifies
the natural hazards for public inspection in the Brigham City Community Development Office; and
B. An agreement by the owner of the parcel and any successor in interest to comply with any
conditions set by the City Planning Commission to minimize potential adverse effects of the natural
hazard(s).

A. Affect suits pending or rights existing immediately prior to the effective date of this ordinance;
or
B. Impair, avoid, or affect any grant or conveyance made or right acquired or cause of action
now existing under any repealed provision or amendment thereto.
The provisions of this ordinance, insofar as they are the same or substantially the same as those
of any prior ordinance, shall be construed as a continuation of the prior ordinance and not as a new
enactment.
29.19.020. Purpose and Intent.
It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users in the Brigham
City Airport and of occupants of land or to property in its vicinity. Such hazard also reduces the size of the
area available for landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, and it tends to destroy or impair the
utility of the Brigham City Municipal Airport and the public investment therein.
Accordingly, it is declared: (1) that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Brigham City Municipal Airport; (2) that it is necessary
in the interest of public health, public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of an
airport hazard be prevented, and; (3) that the prevention of those hazards should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation.
It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards
and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are
public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire lands or
interests in land.
29.19.030. General Provisions.
A. These regulations reinforce specific provisions in the Brigham City Municipal Airport Master
Plan, as amended and Brigham City General Plan, as amended.

29.20.010. Purpose and Effect of Chapter.
Brigham City has a rich historical legacy that is evident in the number of buildings and sites in the
City that are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The Planning Commission and City
Council of Brigham City have found that it is in the interest of the citizens of Brigham City that these
buildings and sites be preserved in a state that does not detract from their historical character, as a
physical reminder of the historical heritage of Brigham City. To this end, the City Council has adopted
design guidelines and a design review ordinance that govern the area bounded by 100 North, 200 South,
100 West and 100 East. The Heritage Site Overlay Zone is intended to provide for economically viable
uses for historic buildings and sites located outside of the above described area. It is the purpose and
intent of the City Council that such uses occur in a planned setting which will be compatible and
complimentary with adjacent uses including, but not limited to, nearby residential neighborhoods, and will
promote a high level of architectural and landscaping excellence. It is further the purpose and intent of the
City Council that preservation of the site’s listing or eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places, and adherence to the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (hereafter “Secretary of Interior’s Standards”), are required in any
approval.
29.20.020. Permitted or Conditional Use Review.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to buildings and sites listed or eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places, and which are located outside of the jurisdiction of Section 29.24.13.
All uses listed as permitted or conditional uses in the underlying zone shall be considered as permitted or
conditional uses when proposed for buildings or sites which are listed or eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. However, no such use shall be approved that would result in the loss of
eligibility or removal of a site from the National Register of Historic Places unless the Planning
Commission makes a finding of fact in the course of a design review or conditional use review that the
loss of such eligibility or removal from the National Register of Historic Places is necessary and in the
best interest of the City. In addition to the standards contained in Chapters 29.06 and 29.01 of this Title,
the Planning Commission shall consider the information and standards listed below, and may attach
reasonable conditions to any approval to assure compatibility with adjacent uses.
29.20.030. Historic Preservation Commission Review.
Prior to submittal of an application to the Planning Commission for conditional or permitted use
approval, or design review approval, for any site under the provisions of this Chapter, the proposal shall
be presented to the Brigham City Historic Preservation Commission for its recommendations a report of
the Historic Preservation Commission’s recommendations regarding the proposal shall be submitted at
the time of application for conditional or permitted use approval, or design review approval.
29.20.040. Findings of Fact Required.
Prior to approval of any conditional use, the Planning Commission shall make findings of fact that
the proposed use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case be detrimental to the health,
safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or
improvements in the vicinity. A conditional use shall be detrimental under the following circumstances:
A. If the proposed use will cause unreasonable risks to the safety of persons or property
because of vehicular traffic or parking, large gatherings of people, or other causes;
B. If the proposed use will unreasonably interfere with the lawful use of surrounding property;
Page 29.20-2
C. If the proposed use will create a need for essential municipal services which cannot be
reasonably met;
D. If the proposed use will in any other way be detrimental to the health, safety, or general
welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or be injurious to property or improvements in the
vicinity.
If a proposed conditional use is found to be contrary to the standards described in this section,
the applicant may propose or consent to mitigating measures which will bring the use into conformance
with the standards described in this section. If the Planning Commission determines the standards of this
section cannot be met and that adequate mitigation measures cannot be imposed to bring the use into
conformity with the standards and criteria, the Planning Commission may deny the request for a
conditional use permit.
29.20.050. Architectural, Landscaping, and Site Plan Standards and Required Information.
Any developer proposing development or a change in use under the provisions of this Chapter
shall provide the following information:
A. A site plan drawn to a scale of not less than 1"=20' showing the parcel intended for
development and the surrounding existing development within two hundred feet (200’) of the site.
B. A detailed site plan or plans for the proposed development showing the existing and/or
proposed location of main buildings, accessory buildings, parking areas, landscaped areas, pedestrian
accommodations, service and loading areas, utilities, and any other site features. Wherever possible,
proposed service and loading areas shall be screened from adjacent uses, the street, and residential
areas.
C. Architectural renderings and elevations of all main and accessory buildings showing existing
conditions and any proposed changes or modifications. Any proposed modifications shall comply with the
Secretary of Interior’s Standards.
D. A proposed landscaping plan along with a planting plan identifying proposed species type
and size.
E. A proposed parking plan.
F. Noise, odor, exhaust, and dust sources shall be identified from all interior or exterior sources
including but not limited to parking areas, trash dumpsters, mechanical equipment, processing
equipment, and loading/service docks.
G. A lighting plan showing the proposed location of site, parking, and security lighting. Such
lighting shall be designed to enhance the architectural quality of the development. Lighting shall be
screened from residential areas, and glare into traffic routes and streets shall be minimized.
H. A signage plan including sign design themes for review by the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission shall not approve a development or use proposal without a sign plan. The
proposed signs shall be consistent with the Secretary of Interior’s Guidelines.
29.20.060. Uses Allowed.
Any use not listed as a permitted or conditional use in the underlying zone may be considered by
the Planning Commission as a conditional use. Such uses shall be considered as required under
Sections 29.20.020 and 29.20.030 above.
29.20.070. Appeal Procedure.
Appeal may be made by any person aggrieved by a final decision, determination, or requirement
of the Planning Commission, pursuant to the standards governing appeals.

the application in the absence of evidence that all public facilities and services are adequate and
available.
E. Adequacy of Public Facilities. The available capacity for public facilities and services shall be
determined in accordance with the following calculation methodology:
1. Adding together the total capacity of existing and planned capital improvements for a
public facility;
2. Calculate available capacity by subtracting from the total capacity of Subsection (a)
herein the sum of:
a. The demand for each public facility created by existing development; and
b. The demand for each public facility created by the anticipated completion of
committed development; and
c. The demand for each public facility created by the anticipated completion of the
proposed development under consideration for concurrency determination.

City Code.
2. If permitted by the Brigham City Council, following a recommendation by the Brigham
City Waste Treatment Department and Brigham City Culinary Water Department, alternative sewage
disposal systems shall be sited and constructed in accordance with applicable health regulations and
standards of Brigham City, Box Elder County, and the State of Utah.
D. Revegetation/Erosion Protection/Runoff Control. To the extent possible, plans for the
development of the North Shore Development and actual construction of infrastructure and land uses
shall provide for the preservation of existing vegetation; shall provide for appropriate, prompt revegetation
or erosion protection measures; and shall provide for surface water runoff control in accordance with the
Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical Specifications or modifications thereto granted
pursuant to the procedure for such modifications.
1. Storm water created by the development shall be detained on the Property and released
according to standard engineering calculations and practices, except as such practices may be modified
for the North Shore Development. Existing natural storm water drainage shall be allowed to follow the
current natural drainage patterns. Due to the unique setting and rural environment of the Property, storm
water management may be accomplished through the use of roadside swales and permeable basins
allowing storm water to infiltrate into the ground. Design and construction of such storm water
management features shall be subject to restrictions of the Brigham City Source Protection Zones if
applicable.
2. All developments shall minimize the area disturbed by construction activities at any given
time.
3. Buildings shall not be located on soils with severe limitations for any of the proposed
uses, unless fully mitigated by appropriate design and construction techniques. Limitations on
development may be due to any of a number of factors including the depth to bedrock or a water table,
soil permeability, the soil’s propensity to shrink and swell and other factors.
29.22.030. Critical Areas
Development within Critical Areas, as defined in Subsections (A) through (C) below, is prohibited.
A. Geologic Hazards. The development layout and design shall avoid areas which may be
adversely affected by geologic hazards. This prohibition may be waived in cases where the developer
demonstrates to the Planning Commission that the geologic hazard is fully mitigated by appropriate
design and construction techniques. Geologic hazards include ground subsidence that may result from
natural or man-made conditions and also any kind of seismic activity.
B. Floodplains. All areas within a one hundred year floodplain as mapped for the Federal Flood
Insurance program, or as calculated by a qualified engineer, or where the prevailing or potential natural
vegetation is riparian in nature, are declared to be critical to the maintenance of the North Shore
Development’s hydrologic systems, fisheries, and wildlife habitat. Development of floodplain areas has a
significant potential to adversely affect wildlife, water quality, and if it modifies the floodway, adjoining,
upstream and downstream properties, roads and other public facilities. Development in floodplain areas
may also be constrained by a high water table which raises the cost of installing and maintaining utilities.
Finally, floodplain development adversely affects all taxpayers through public expenditures to prevent or
clean up flood damages.
1. Development, other than open use recreation, shall be prohibited in areas that include
one hundred year floodplains. Structures shall not be permitted in a one hundred year floodplain.
2. Road and driveway crossings shall bridge over all one hundred year floodplains. The
installation of culverts for such purposes shall be minimized and is generally not appropriate.
3. Where one hundred year floodplain areas are modified any action that may increase
flood hazards or adversely affect water quality or fisheries shall be avoided. Such actions may include,
Page 29.22-7
but are not limited to, stream channel modifications, the storage of floatable or potentially polluting
materials, and the construction of stream crossings.
4. Plantings or natural areas (as opposed to scrap metal, junked vehicles, or concrete
slabs) shall be used where stream channels are required to be stabilized. Riprap may be utilized if
approved in advance through the development review process, and integrated with a planting plan.
29.22.040. Water and Water Supply.
A. For individual subdivisions and development proposals, the developer shall submit a site plan
prepared by a professional engineer showing the property boundary with topography, proposed building
envelopes, and proposed public and private roads and streets. The submittal shall show infrastructure
necessary to serve the proposed development with a water system designed in compliance with the
Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical Specifications, or applicable modifications thereto, to
be dedicated to Brigham City, serving all building lots. A publicly dedicated water system is necessary for
the following purposes:
1. To protect existing and future Brigham City water rights and water sources;
2. To provide an efficient and reliable water source for fire prevention and suppression;
3. To provide development sites with an efficient and reliable source of water for culinary
and other uses.
B. Source Protection. All development shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in
compliance with applicable Brigham City source protection zones. Source protection restrictions must be
binding on all heirs, successors, and assigns. Any land use restrictions required to insure compliance with
source protection restrictions must be recorded with the property description in the Box Elder County
Recorder’s Office. Copies of this recording must be submitted to the Brigham City Culinary Water
Department for review.
29.22.050. Sanitary Sewer.
A. For individual subdivisions and development proposals, the developer shall submit a site plan
prepared by a professional engineer showing the property boundary with topography, proposed building
envelopes, and proposed public and private roads and streets. The submittal shall show infrastructure
necessary to serve the proposed development with a sanitary sewer system serving all building lots. A
sanitary sewer system is necessary for the following purposes:
1. To protect existing and future Brigham City water sources from contamination;
2. To provide development sites with an efficient and reliable system for the treatment of
sewage and waste water;
3. To protect water bodies on and adjacent to the property subject to this Planned District
from contamination.
The system shall be designed in compliance with the Brigham City Public Works Standards and
Technical Specifications, or applicable modifications thereto.
B. Easements or rights-of-way required for sewer service by the Brigham City Waste Treatment
Department shall be provided by all developments proposing public sewer systems prior to final
subdivision plat or final development plan approval.
C. Where the Brigham City Sanitary Sewer Capital Facilities Plan calls for sewer main sizes
through a development that are larger than necessary to serve the development, the larger main shall be
installed in accordance with Brigham City policy.
29.22.060. Fire Protection.
A. Water infrastructure and water supply shall be in place and serviceable prior to any
combustible construction.
B. Brigham City Fire Department Level of Service Standards
1. The Brigham City Fire Department has established the acceptable emergency response
time as ten (10) minutes or less within the District. An acceptable response time to larger scale
development may actually be less, as determined by the Brigham City Fire Department. (It must be
realized that prevailing weather conditions, general topography, geographical diversities, and unusual
traffic conditions may inhibit Fire Department response times at any time of year.)
2. In order to comply with an acceptable level of service standard, a developer may be
required to provide appropriate fire protection infrastructure, including facilities, apparatus, and equipment
for the Brigham City Fire Department to comply with the appropriate level of service standard. In addition,
approved fire sprinkler and suppression systems may be required by the Fire Marshall in conjunction with
Page 29.22-8
other appropriate mitigation measures, which must be approved by the Fire Marshall, to comply with the
required level of service standard.
3. If the Brigham City Fire Marshall determines that a desired level of service cannot be
provided to a proposed development, the developer shall prepare and submit a Fire Protection Mitigation
Plan to the Fire Marshall for review and approval. This plan shall address the measures that will be used
to comply with the intent of the level of service standard, and the timing/phasing in which such measures
will be provided. An acceptable mitigation plan shall be approved by the Brigham City Fire Marshall
before a final subdivision plan, or final site plan approval is granted. Failure of a developer to provide an
acceptable plan may be cause for denial of a development application by Brigham City.
C. Development in Wildfire Hazard Areas
1. All proposed new subdivisions or developments will be analyzed and rated for wildfire risk
using the Fire Hazard Severity Scale developed by the State of Utah, Division of State Lands and
Forestry. All of these factors can vary from development to development. The composite score will
categorize the hazard level of the proposed development. Once a proposed subdivision or development
has been classified as to its hazard level, development standards for each level can be used by the
Brigham City Fire Marshall to guide fire protection and wildfire prevention measures. This rating shall be
submitted to Brigham City at the initial stage of a subdivision application, as required by the Fire Marshall,
or as otherwise required in the processing of development permits for any proposed development. The
Rating Scale is based on five separate factors:
a. Slope – This factor is displayed as a percentage. It is calculated by measuring the
vertical distance and horizontal distance for a given area, and dividing the vertical by the horizontal.
b. Aspect – This factor is the cardinal direction in which the surface of the ground faces.
c. Response Time of Fire Agency – This factor is measured in minutes it takes the
nearest responsible fire agency to respond to a fire in a given area.
d. Type of Vegetation – This factor is categorized by fuel types. Rates of spread,
resistance to control, and potential to cause structural damage are the criteria for rating severity.
e. Vegetation Density – This factor is considered the total combustible vegetation that
may be available as a fuel for wildfire.
2. Fuel Breaks/Vegetation Manipulation
a. Hazardous fuels in the form of native vegetation will be cleared around structures and
around the perimeter of the development to assist in wildfire prevention measures. This fuel break is not
intended as a complete vegetation clearing fire break. Fuel breaks must be in place prior to occupancy of
the structure.
b. The definition of a fuel break by the Utah State Division of Lands and Forestry is, “a
change in fuel continuity, type of fuel, or degree of flammability of fuel in a strategically located parcel or
strip of land to reduce or hinder the rate of fire spread”.
c. Fuel breaks shall consist of the following:
i. Grasses within 30 feet of structures shall be mowed to four inches (4”) or less.
ii. Ground litter shall be removed annually.
iii. Over mature, dead, and dying trees shall be evaluated as to their potential to
ignite and to carry fire and possibly will be removed.
iv. Fuel breaks may contain individual tree specimens, ornamental plants, or other
similar vegetation used as ground cover, provided they will not provide a means of transmitting wildfire
from native vegetation to structures.
v. Fire resistive vegetation shall be planted in the fuel breaks to prevent undue soil
erosion.
d. A maintained fuel break easement around the perimeter of any development shall be
dedicated in favor of Brigham City and shall be shown on the final recorded subdivision plat of a
subdivision or the final approved site plan of a development not requiring subdivision. The easement shall
be recorded by separate deed for development plans not requiring subdivision of land. Fuel breaks must
be maintained by the landowners and a requirement for such maintenance shall be included as a
stipulation in private covenants recorded as part of any subdivision plat approval. In subdivisions, planned
unit developments, or other developments where a Homeowners’ or other Association of property owners
is created, such Association shall be responsible for monitoring of the fuel break easement. Private
covenants for the subdivision, planned unit development, or other development shall include language
enabling the Homeowner’s or other property owners’ Association to budget for and provide fuel break
maintenance services around the perimeter of the development boundary.
e. The following chart identifies fuel break clearing limits around structures and
development perimeters based on the wildfire hazard rating:
Page 29.22-9
Type Moderate High Extreme
Structures 30 feet 50 feet 100 feet
Development Perimeters None 75 feet 100 feet
D. Certification of compliance with adopted service levels and standards of the Brigham City Fire
Department, shall occur prior to Final Site Plan approval, or in the case of a single-family dwelling unit or
any use approved as a Conditional Use or a Permitted Use, before a building permit is issued for such
development.
E. Fire hydrants, water line sizes, water storage for fire protection, and minimum flow for fire
protection shall be determined by using the standards of the Insurance Services Office, which are known
as the Fire System Grading Standards and the Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical
Specifications. In no case shall minimum fire flow be less than one thousand gallons per minute for a
period of two (2) hours, unless otherwise permitted herein, or as approved by the Fire Marshall.
F. Plat Note Required. All recorded subdivision plats for the North Shore Development shall
include the following note. In developments not requiring subdivision of land, an affidavit containing the
following note shall be recorded against the subject property in the Box Elder County Recorder’s Office.
The property owner acknowledges that he/she is building in a rural environment adjacent
to lands managed primarily for natural values including wildlife habitat and agriculture. As
such, the property owner is on notice that public services in the area are subject to the
constraints inherent to such environments. Emergency response time may be longer than
it is in more accessible areas, and access by emergency vehicles may be impeded at
times due to weather and road conditions. The owner understands and acknowledges
that wildfire risks are higher in the North Shore Development than in other areas of
Brigham City. By this notice, the property owner assumes the risk of occupancy as
outlined above.
29.22.070. Transportation Infrastructure and Access Design.
A. Access.
1. Access to Existing Roads. All points of access to existing Brigham City roads or streets
shall meet the standards set forth in the Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical
Specifications, or applicable modifications thereto. The design and construction of turn lanes, merging
lanes, traffic signs or signals and other improvements required to make access points conform to Brigham
City standards shall be the responsibility of the developer.
2. Development plans shall provide for the dedication of any rights-of-way which are within
but will not serve a development, and which are determined by the Planning Commission or City Council
to be necessary to effectively link the proposed development with future major roads or future
developments or to prevent the “landlocking” of adjoining properties or to provide the best possible longterm
circulation pattern.
B. Road Infrastructure Design
1. The design and construction of all roads in the North Shore development shall be in
accordance with the Brigham City Public Works Standards and Technical Specifications as modified for
the North Shore development.
2. Roads on soils having low bearing strengths, high shrink-swell potentials or high frost
heave hazards may be required, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, to be constructed to
specifications more demanding than those required on other sites.
C. Cul-de-Sacs
1. Cul-de-sacs are discouraged and shall only be permitted where they are identified on the
General Development Plan or subsequent development plans.
2. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac on any non-rural designated road, as designated on
the General Development Plan or subsequent development plans shall be six hundred feet (600’).
3. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac on a rural designated road, as designated on the
General Development Plan or subsequent development plans shall be as follows, unless the Fire
Marshall agrees to other lengths. The length of these cul-de-sacs shall be based on the wildfire hazard
rating of the surrounding area.

fifty feet (50’) of the outlet.
D. Bridges and Culverts: Bridges and culverts shall be constructed to support a gross vehicle
weight of forty thousand (40,000) pounds and shall have vehicle load limits posted. Permanent culverts
shall be installed at all intermittent and perennial stream crossings. Specifications for bridges, culverts,
and other stream crossing devices shall take into account at least the twenty-five (25) year frequency
storm and upstream debris hazard. If the development is within a one hundred year flood plain, then one
hundred year frequency storm shall be used in drainage design.
E. Traffic Control and Street Signage
1. All roads will be designated with road names and signs will be installed at each major
road intersection. All lots and/or home sites will be visibly signed with street addresses and numbered as
such. Emergency access roads shall be clearly identified.
2. All roads shall be named or numbered in accordance with the City’s addressing system
and road identification signs in accordance with City standards and specifications. All permitted occupied
structures shall post addresses prior to occupancy.
3. The developer shall be responsible for the expense of constructing and placing traffic
control signs, as follows:
a. Stop signs shall be placed at all intersections of arterials; of collectors and arterials;
and when appropriate as determined by the City Engineer, local streets/roads and collectors.
b. Yield signs shall be required at the intersection of all other streets and roads when
determined by the Streets Department.
F. Snow Removal and Road Maintenance on Private Roads: Snow removal and road
maintenance on private roads will be the responsibility of the respective property owner or Homeowners’
Association and will be noted as such on the recorded plat of any subdivision which includes private
streets. The CC&R’s for the development shall include enforcement language for mandatory budgeting by
the Association to provide snow removal and road maintenance services. When no Homeowners’
Association exists, snow removal shall be the responsibility of the owner of the private street.
G. Pedestrian Access
1. Sidewalks, pedestrian walkways, or non-motorized trails shall be provided for internal
pedestrian, bicycle, and/or equestrian circulation within developed portions of the North Shore
Development.

recommendation by the Brigham City Planning Commission, with input from the affected utility,
determines that special conditions exist, other than cost, which should permit the utility to be installed
above ground.
2. Natural gas service may be installed at the developer’s option. Propane use must
conform to all applicable provisions of the Uniform Fire Code.
3. Rights-of-way or easements shall be provided as required by the utilities serving the
proposed development.
4. Underground utility services shall be installed extending into private property to a
distance fifteen feet (15’) feet from the property line of each lot before roads are surfaced.
I. Coordination with Box Elder School District: All developments proposing residential uses
shall coordinate such development proposals with the Box Elder School District. All residential
developments where public maintenance is anticipated shall provide adequate school bus loading and
turn-around areas, as evidenced by a written statement from the Box Elder School District.
29.22.080. Special Site Design Requirements.
These criteria serve the public interest by requiring that the design of developments in the North
Shore Development are compatible with the natural, rural environment and characteristics of their setting
Page 29.22-11
and with the image of the area which Brigham City seeks to promote; helping to reduce the potential for
land use conflicts by encouraging the protection of privacy and scenic views; and protecting the integrity
of the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge.
A. Clustering of homes is encouraged to allow for reduced infrastructure costs for roads,
driveways and water and sanitary sewer systems when compared with conventional design, and promote
the visual integrity of development as viewed from within the development.
B. Development in the North Shore Development planned district shall be integrated in a
manner that is consistent with the Brigham City General Plan and the General Development Plan for the
North Shore Development. Integration shall be accomplished through, among other things, pedestrian
and vehicular circulation, visual, open space, and other linkages and design techniques. A piecemeal
approach to planning and development, where individual development parcels are designed and
constructed without adequate integration opportunities with surrounding areas, will not be permitted.
C. Outbuildings, Barns, and Associated Corrals: Outbuildings, barns, and associated corrals
intended for the keeping and use of horses shall be located in the rear yard not closer than sixty feet (60’)
from the rear plane of the house.
29.22.090. Lighting Regulations.
A. Purpose. The general purpose of this Section is to protect and promote the public health,
safety and welfare, the quality of life, and the ability to view the night sky, by establishing regulations and
a process of review for exterior lighting. This Section establishes standards for exterior lighting in order to

B. Definitions
1. Cut-off Angle (of a luminaire) – the angle, measured up from the nadir, between the
vertical axis and the first line of sight at which the bare source is not visible.
2. Foot-candle – a unit of illuminance amounting to on lumen per square foot.
3. Fully Shielded – outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light rays are
emitted by the installed fixtures at angles above the horizontal plane. This means that the shield is not
flush or parallel with the light source or bulb. This is referred to in this document as a cut-off-fixture.
4. Glare – the sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is sufficiently
greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in
visual performance and visibility.
5. Illuminance – the quantity of light, or luminous flux, arriving at a surface divided by the
area of the illuminated surface, measured in lux or foot-candles.
6. Installed – the initial installation of outdoor light fixtures defined herein, following the
effective date of this ordinance but shall not apply to those outdoor light fixtures installed prior to such
date.
7. Light trespass – light emitted by a lighting installation that falls outside the boundaries of
the property on which the installation is sited (also called spill light).
8. Lumen – a unit of measurement.
9. Luminance – the physical quantity corresponding to the brightness of a surface (e.g. a
lamp, luminaries, sky, or reflecting material) in a specified direction. It is the luminous intensity of an area
of the surface divided by that area.
Page 29.22-12
10. Luminaire – a complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps together with the parts
designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps and to connect the lamps to the power
supply.
11. Lux (lx) – the SI unit of illuminance. One lux is one lumen per square meter.
12. Obtrusive light – spill light which, because of quantitative, directional, or spectral context,
gives rise to annoyance, discomfort, distraction, or a reduction in the ability to see essential information.
13. Outdoor Light Fixtures – outdoor artificial illuminating devices, outdoor fixtures, lamps,
and other devices, permanent or portable, used for illumination or advertisement. Such devices shall
include, but are not limited to search, spot, or flood lights for:
a. buildings and structures, including canopies and overhangs
b. recreational areas
c. parking lot lighting
d. landscape lighting
e. signs
f. street lighting
g. display and service areas
14. Spill light – light emitted by a lighting installation that falls outside the boundaries of the
property on which the installation is sited (also called light trespass).
C. Approved Materials and Methods of Installation
The provisions of this Section are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of
installation not specifically prescribed by this Section provided any such alternate has been approved.
The Planning Commission may approve any such alternate provided that the proposed design, material,
or method provides approximate equivalence to the specific requirements of this Section, or is otherwise
satisfactory and complies with the intent of this Section.
1. Shielding. All outdoor light fixtures except those exempted by Section 29.22.090(F) and
those regulated by Section 29.22.090(C)(2) shall be fully shielded as required in Section 29.

29.24.010. Purpose.
The purpose and intent of design review is to secure the general purposes of this Ordinance and
the master plan and to insure that the general appearance of buildings and structures and the
development of the land shall in no case be such as would impair the orderly and harmonious
development of the neighborhood or impair investment in and occupation of the neighborhood.
It shall not be the intent of this Chapter to restrict or specify the particular architectural design
proposed or to specify the exterior detail or design, color, or materials proposed by the applicant, except
as such detail is of such magnitude as to affect the general appearance and compatibility of the
development with its surroundings.
29.24.020. Application and Review.
All applications for occupancy permits or building permits for all buildings and structures, except
for single family and two family dwellings and their accessory buildings, shall be accompanied by
architectural and site development plans to scale which shall show building locations, landscaping,
prominent existing trees, ground treatment, fences, off-street parking and circulation, location and size of
the adjacent streets, north arrow and property lines, drawings of the major exterior elevations, the building
materials, proposed exterior color scheme, existing grades and proposed new grades. All such drawings
and sketches shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission, except that the review and approval of such
permits by the Community Development Department may be authorized as set forth by the Planning
Commission Policy when the application meets all requirements of this ordinance. The number of sets of
architectural and site development plans to be submitted shall be determined by the Community
Development Department. All of the above required architectural and site development plans shall have
been reviewed and approved prior to the issuing of a building permit.
29.24.030. Exceptions.
For buildings and uses covered by conditional use permits or planned unit development approval,
design review shall be incorporated within such conditional use permits or planned unit development
approval and need not be a separate application, provided the requirements of this Chapter are met.
Agricultural buildings are exempt.
29.24.040. Planning Commission Approval.
The Planning Commission, or the Community Development Department when authorized by the
Planning Commission, shall determine whether the proposed architectural and site development plans
submitted are consistent with this Chapter and with the general objectives of this Ordinance, and shall
give or withhold approval accordingly. Denial of approval by the Community Development Department
may be appealed to the Planning Commission, and denial by the Planning Commission may be appealed
to the local Governing Body, as provided for appeals in this Ordinance.
Page 29.24-2
29.24.050. Considerations in Review of Applications.
The Planning Commission and the Community Development Department shall consider the
following matters, and others when applicable, in their review of applications:

signs and structures in relation to the creation of traffic hazards and the appearance and harmony with
adjacent development.
C. Considerations relating to landscaping:
1. The location, height, and materials of walls, fences, hedges, and screen plantings to
insure harmony with adjacent development, or to conceal storage areas, utility installations, or other
unsightly development.
2. The planting of ground cover or other surfacing to prevent dust and erosion.
3. The unnecessary destruction of existing healthy trees.
D. Considerations relating to buildings and site layout:
1. Consideration of the general silhouette and mass, including location on the site,
elevations, and relation to natural plant coverage, all in relationship to the neighborhood.
2. Consideration of exterior design in relation to adjoining structures in height, bulk, and
area openings, breaks in facade facing on the street (or streets), line and pitch of roofs, and the
arrangement of structures on the parcel.
E. Considerations relating to drainage:
1. The effect of the site development plan on the adequacy of the storm and surface water
drainage.
29.24.060. Conditions.
The Planning Commission, or the Community Development Department when authorized, shall
decide all applications for design review. Design approval may include such conditions consistent with the
considerations of this Chapter as the Commission or Community Development Department deems
reasonable and necessary under the circumstances to carry out the intent of this Chapter.
29.24.070. Findings and Decision.
Upon a finding by the Planning Commission or Community Development Department that the
application meets the intent of this Chapter, the design approval shall be granted, subject to such
conditions as are necessary; otherwise, approval shall be denied.
29.24.080. Notification of Approval or Denial.
Upon the grant of design approval, the Community Development Department shall prepare and
mail or deliver to the applicant a formal statement thereof, stating the fact of the grant and any conditions
attached thereto, or the fact of denial and the reasons therefor.
29.24.090. Time Limitations on Approval.
If construction in harmony with the permit for any development for which design approval has
been granted has not been commenced within one (1) year from date of notification of approval, the
approval shall be deemed automatically revoked. Upon application an extension of time may be granted
by the Planning Commission, or by the Community Development Department if authorized.
29.24.100. Transfer of Approval upon Change in Use.
Design approval shall be deemed revoked if the buildings erected or the classification of their use
or the classification of the use of land for which the approval was granted is changed, unless the approval
is transferred by the Planning Commission, or the Community Development Department if authorized to
do so. If the transfer is not approved, a new application must be filed.
Page 29.24-3
29.24.110. Conformance to Approval.
Development for which design approval has been granted shall conform to the approval and any
conditions attached thereto.
29.24.120. Modification.
Upon request of the applicant, modifications in the approved plan may be made by the Planning
Commission or the Community Development Department if authorized to do so, if it is found that the
modification will meet requirements of this Chapter. The Planning Commission may revoke or modify a
design approval which does not conform to any requirement of the approval permit.
29.24.130. Supplemental Provisions for Historic Downtown.
The purpose and intent of design review within the downtown Main Street district bounded by 100
North on the north, 200 South on the South, 100 East on the east, and 100 West on the west, is to secure
the general purposes of this ordinance and the general plan and to ensure that the general appearance of
buildings, structures, signs, and the development of the land shall in no case be such as would impair the
historic character and appearance of the central business district of Brigham City.
To this end, under provisions of this Chapter, design review may restrict or specify the particular
architectural design proposed and specify the exterior detail or design, color, or materials proposed by the
applicant.
All applications for development or redevelopment requiring review under this chapter shall be
designed in conformance with the Brigham City Historic Downtown Guidelines.

29.25.010. Purpose.
The purpose of the planned unit development is to allow diversification in the relationship of
various uses and structures to their sites, and to permit more flexibility in the use of such sites. The
application of planned unit concepts is intended to encourage excellence in neighborhood, housing, or
area design, while insuring substantial compliance with the intent of the General Plan, district regulations
and other provisions of this ordinance relating to the public health, safety, and general welfare, and at the
same time securing the advantages of large-scale site planning for residential, commercial or industrial
developments, or combinations thereof. 1
29.25.020. Definition.
Planned unit development, for the purposes of this Ordinance, shall mean an integrated design
for development of residential, commercial, or industrial uses, or combinations of such uses, in which one
or more of the regulations, other than use regulations, of the District in which the development is to be
situated, is waived or varied to allow flexibility and initiative in site and building design and location, in
accordance with an approved plan and imposed general requirements as specified in this Chapter.
29.25.030. Planned Unit Development Permit.
Planned unit developments may be allowed by Planning Commission approval in any zoning
district. No such planned unit development permit shall be granted unless such development will meet the
use limitations of the zoning district in which it is to be located, including planned unit developments in
planned districts, and meet the density and other limitations of such districts, except as such
requirements may be lawfully modified as provided by this Chapter or by district regulations. Compliance
with the regulations of this Ordinance in no sense excuses the developer from the applicable
requirements of the subdivision ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in
the approval of the application for the planned unit development.
29.25.040. Required Conditions.
A. No planned unit development shall have an area less than that approved by the Planning
Commission as adequate for the proposed development. No minimum area is specified. However,
Planned Unit Developments of any size may be allowed only upon a finding of fact by the Planning
Commission that the plan complies with the intent of the General Plan, and incorporates excellence of
neighborhood, housing, or area design, that will compensate for the effects upon the neighborhood of
deviations from district regulations.2
B. A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted in the zoning district in
which it is to be located will require a change of zoning district and shall be accompanied by an
application for a zoning amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a permitted use
1 Ordinance No. 98-11, 3/19/98
2 Ordinance No. 98-11, 3/19/98
Page 29.25-2
in a planned unit development which allows residential uses and shall be governed by density, design,
and other requirements of the planned unit development permit.
C. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the
subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property.
D. The Planning Commission shall require such arrangements of structures and open spaces
within the site development plan as necessary to assure that adjacent properties will not be adversely
affected:
1. Density of land use intensity shall in no case be more than twenty-five percent (25%)
higher than allowed in the zoning district, except not more than ten percent (10%) higher in residential
districts.
2. Where feasible, least height and intensity of buildings and uses shall be arranged around
the boundaries of the development.
3. Lot area, width, yard, height, density and coverage regulations shall be determined by
approval of the site development plan.
E. Preservation, maintenance and ownership of required open spaces within the development
shall be accomplished by:
1. Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system, or,
2. Granting to the Local Jurisdiction a permanent, open space easement on and over the
said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in recreational use, with
ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of an Owners' Association established with articles of
association and by-laws which are satisfactory to the Governing Body, or,
3. Complying with the provisions of the Condominium Ownership Act of 1963, as per Utah
Code, which provides for the payment of common expenses for the up keep of the common areas and
facilities.
F. Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the several uses within the site and as a
means of integrating the proposed development into its surroundings shall be planned and presented to
the Planning Commission for approval, together with other required plans for the development.
G. The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the intensity and direction of area
or flood-lighting shall be detailed in the application.
H. A grading and drainage plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission with the
application.
I. A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings shall be prepared for the
entire site to be developed.
J. The proposed use of the particular location shall be shown as necessary or desirable, to
provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general well-being of the neighborhood and the
community.
K. It shall be shown that under the circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will
not be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the
planned unit development.
29.25.050. Uses Allowed.
Subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission, uses allowed in a planned unit
development shall be those uses allowed in the planned district or other zoning district in which the
planned unit development is to be located; provided, that for the purposes of this Chapter and Ordinance,
multiple-family dwellings may be allowed in a planned unit development approved in a single-family
zoning district, provided the overall density of the development does not exceed ten percent (10%) above
the density normally allowed for single-family dwellings in said District.
29.25.060. General Site Plan.
Application shall be accompanied by a general site plan showing, where pertinent:
A. The use or uses, dimensions, sketch elevations, and locations of proposed structures.
B. Dimensions and locations of areas to be reserved and developed for vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, parking, public uses such as schools and playgrounds, landscaping, and other
open spaces.
C. Architectural drawings and sketches outlining the general design and character of the
proposed uses and the physical relationship of the uses.
D. Such other pertinent information, including residential density, coverage, and open space
characteristics, shall be included as may be necessary to make a determination that the contemplated
arrangement of buildings and uses makes it desirable to apply regulations and requirements differing
from those ordinarily applicable under this Ordinance.
Page 29.25-3
29.25.070. Review by Planning Commission.
In order that it may approve a planned unit development, the Planning Commission shall have
authority to require that the following conditions (among others it deems appropriate) be met by the
applicant:
A. That the proponents of the planned unit development have demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Planning Commission that they are financially able to carry out the proposed project.
B. That the proponents intend to start construction within one (1) year of the approval of the
project and any necessary zoning district change, and intend to complete said construction, or approved
stages thereof, within four (4) years from the date construction begins.
C. That application for planned unit development in planned districts meets the requirements of
such districts, including the requirements of the general development plan.
D. That the development is planned as one complex land use rather than as an aggregation of
individual and unrelated buildings and uses.
E. That the development as planned will accomplish the purpose outlined in Section 29.25.010.
29.25.080. Scope of Planning Commission Action.
In carrying out the intent of this Chapter, the Planning Commission shall consider the following
principles:
A. It is the intent of this Chapter that site and building plans for a planned unit development shall
be prepared by a designer or team of designers having professional competence in urban planning as
proposed in the application. The commission may require the applicant to engage such a qualified
designer or design team.
B. It is not the intent of this Section that control of the design of a planned unit development by
the Planning Commission be so rigidly exercised that individual initiative be stifled and substantial
additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of this Section that the control exercised be the
minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this Chapter.
C. The Planning Commission may approve or disapprove an application for a planned unit
development. In an approval, the Commission may attach such conditions as it may deem necessary to
secure compliance with the purposes set forth in Section 29.25.010. The approval or denial of an
application for a planned unit development by the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Appeal
Authority. All appeals must be filed with the Community Development Department within thirty (30) days
of the date of the final decision of the Planning Commission.
29.25.090. Construction Limitations.
A. Upon approval of a planned unit development, construction shall proceed only in accordance
with the plans and specifications approved by the Planning Commission, and in conformity with any
conditions attached by the commission to its approval.
B. Amendments to approved plans and specifications for a planned unit development shall be
obtained only by following the procedures here outlined for first approval.
C. The Community Development Department shall not issue any permit for any proposed
building, structure or use within the project unless such building, structure or use is in accordance with the
approved development plan and with any conditions imposed in conjunction with its approval.

29.26.210. Off-Street Loading Space Design Standards. ....................................................................... 13
29.26.010. Purpose.
The purpose of these off-street parking requirements is to reduce congestion and traffic hazards
within Brigham City by incorporating adequate, attractively-designed off-street parking and loading
facilities for various land uses. Parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that they will result in
maximum efficiency, protection of public safety, provide for the special needs of the handicapped, and
where appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from adverse impacts created by such parking.
29.26.020. General Provisions for Off-Street Parking and Loading.
A. Applicability
1. New Development: The off-street parking standards of this chapter apply to any new
development and to any new use established.
2. Expansions and Alterations: The off-street parking standards of this chapter apply when
an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking spaces shall be
required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use. The Planning
Commission may require increases in parking for non-complying parking areas when found necessary to
ensure adequate off-street parking.
3. Change of Use: Off-street parking shall be required for any change of use or change of
operation that would result in a requirement for more parking than the existing use. Additional parking
shall be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use.
4. Areas for deliveries and loading shall be required as a part of the site plan review to
ensure that loading and deliveries do not constrain fire access, street safety, or use public streets for
deliveries.
B. Parking and Loading areas to be maintained.
All off-street parking and loading area within the City shall comply with all of the standards
prescribed in this Chapter, and shall be permanently maintained in good condition for the duration of the
use or uses served by the facility. All paved areas shall be maintained in good repair without broken
parts, potholes or litter.
Page 29.26-2
29.26.030. Site, Access, and Lighting Plan Required .
All applications for a building permit shall be accompanied by a detailed site, access and lighting
plan showing the required off-street parking spaces and points of access. Parking lots with less than five
(5) spaces are not required to submit a lighting plan.
29.26.040. Off-Street Parking Schedules.
A. Off-Street Parking Requirements.
The table below contains the minimum parking requirements for specific uses. The maximum
percentage allowed for compact spaces is also given. Special requirements for each use are provided

Appeals to the decision of the Community
Development Director or designee are made
to the Appeal Authority as designated in
Chapter 29.04 of this Title.
B. Rules for Computing Requirements: The following rules apply when computing off -street
parking and loading requirements:
1. Multiple Uses: Parking for multiple use sharing the parking shall comply with the
requirements of Section 29.26.080 for shared parking.
2. Fractions: If, in the application of the requirements of this Chapter, a fractional number is
obtained, any fraction will be disregarded.
3. Area Measurements: Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based
parking and loading standards are to be computed on the basis of gross floor area.
4. Occupancy-Based Standards: For the purpose of computing parking based on
employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of
persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire‒rated capacity,
whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.
5. Unlisted Uses: Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed
in an off -street parking schedule, the Community Development Director or designee shall apply the offstreet
parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or
require a parking study in accordance with this chapter.
Page 29.26-6
C. Off-Street Parking For Land Uses with Unique Parking Requirements: Off-street parking for
land uses with unique parking requirements and uses which have widely varying parking demand
characteristics, make it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. Uses found by the
Community Development Director or designee to have unique parking requirements shall comply with the
provisions of this subsection.
1. A developer proposing to develop or expand a land use with unique parking requirements
shall submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces
proposed.
2. The Community Development Department and City Engineer shall review this study and
any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street
parking standard for the proposed use.
3. A parking study shall include estimates of parking based on recommendations of the
Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Public Works
Department, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are
the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by
density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, location, or parameters of the use that may be estimated to
parking requirements.
4. The study shall document the source of data used, and methods used to develop their
recommendations. After reviewing the parking study, the Community Development Department and City
Engineer shall establish a minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use.
5. Appeals of the administrative decision may be made to the Appeal Authority in
accordance with the procedures of Chapter 29.04 of this Title.
D. Parking Requirement within the Historical Brigham City Downtown
1. The boundary of the Historical Brigham City Downtown shall be defined as those
properties that front on or within the boundary of 100 North to 200 South and 100 East to 100 West.
2. The protection of the buildings and the historical environment within the historical
downtown should be overall objective when considering parking within this area.
3. Because of the nature of the building and uses within the historical downtown area all
parking requirements will be reviewed evaluated by the Planning Commission on a case by case basis.
4. A parking study may be required to evaluate and determine the needed parking.
29.26.050. Reduction of Parking Requirement.
The number of parking spaces required by these schedules may be reduced as a condition of the
development review by the Planning Commission for conditional use applications or as approved by the
Community Development Director or designee for permitted uses if it can be demonstrated through a
parking study, prepared by a traffic engineer, that the proposed use(s) would have a parking demand less
than the requirements stated in this Chapter. This parking study must be validated through empirical
evidence, which is acceptable to the Community Development Director or designee, from similar uses.
Appeals of the decision of the Planning Commission and Community Development Director or designee
are made to the Appeal Authority as outlined in Chapter 29.04 of this Title.
29.26.060. Maximum Number of Parking Spaces.
In order to minimize the number of unused parking spaces, the number of parking spaces
specified in this Chapter shall not be exceeded by an amount of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
the required off-street parking.
29.26.070. Design Standards for Off-Street Parking and Loading Spaces. 1
A. Access to required off-street parking spaces shall be from a private driveway and not from a
public street and shall not be designed to require vehicles to back onto a street, except:
1. Single-family; and
2. Two-family, Three-family, and Four-family dwellings, with site specific approval by the
City Engineer and City Public Works Director. Such approval shall take into consideration the following:
a. The uniform application of Public Works standards and specifications.

29.26.080. Shared Parking.
A. When any land or building is under the same ownership or under a joint use agreement and is
used for two or more purposes, the number of parking spaces is computed by multiplying the minimum
amount of parking normally required for each land use by the appropriate percentage as shown in the
following parking credit schedule for each of the five time periods shown. The number of parking spaces
required is determined by totaling the resulting numbers in each column; the column total that generates
the highest number of parking spaces then becomes the parking requirement.

3. Modification of the Natural Resources Permit Plans. Modification of the conditional use
permit plans for natural resource excavation may be initiated by the Planning Commission or by the
permittee where it is merely sought to affect minor revisions in the approved grading plan, schedule of
proposed operation, proposed reuse plan, or landscape plan. Consideration of such revisions need not
require a public hearing provided that in the judgment of the Planning Commission the proposed revisions
would not constitute significant changes, and providing also, that the permittee has not expressly
requested that a public hearing be held.
29.28.090. Transfer to Successor Operation.
Whenever an operator succeeds to the interest of another operator by sale, assignment, lease, or

operator, to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission under the approved operations and reclamation
plans and the posting of surety. Upon satisfactory assumption of such responsibilities by the successor
operator, under conditions approved by the Planning Commission the responsibility of the total excavation
site shall be transferred to the successor operator.
29.28.100. Permit Term.
Notwithstanding Section 29.06.090, a conditional use permit for natural resource excavation may
be approved for a specific term with subsequent renewals as approved by the Planning Commission.
The intent of this Section is to allow the Planning Commission to conduct a review of a natural resource
excavation operation following an initial approval term to determine if impacts have exceeded those
foreseen in the initial review process and to allow conditions to be added to the original approval to
mitigate those impacts.
29.28.110. Conditional Use Standards for Natural Resource Excavation.
A. The following standards shall apply to all conditional use permits granted under this Chapter.
The Planning Commission may modify these standards or attach additional conditions upon a finding by
the Planning Commission that such modifications or additional conditions are necessary to mitigate
impacts of natural resource excavation operations as determined during a conditional use permit review
procedure.
1. Buffer Distances.
a) All extractive operations, roads, machinery, equipment, and stockpiles (excluding top
soil used for reclamation, and screening and rock crushing) shall be kept at least one hundred feet
horizontal distance from the boundary with any other property owner except as may be reduced by the
Planning Commission, but in no event should the operation be closer than forty feet to the property line,
except as provided in Section 29.28.120 (3)(e) below.
b) All screening and rock crushing operations shall be conducted at least four hundred
feet horizontal distance from the boundary of any other property owner (except as may be reduced by the
Planning Commission, but in no event shall the operation be closer than fifty feet to the property).
c) All excavations shall be kept at least one hundred feet (100’) from a public road
except where the Planning Commission determines the excavations may be moved closer if it will not
endanger the users of the road.
2. Fencing. Areas of excavation with serious or hazardous conditions shall be reasonably
fenced, except where in the determination of the Planning Commission other suitable devices may be
used.
3. Grading. All grading, including slope stabilization, shall be done in accordance with the
latest reclamation plans, with the concurrence of the City Engineer.
4. Air Quality. All air quality plans and actions shall be monitored and approved by the Utah
Division of Air Quality. The permittee shall obtain an air quality approval order from the Utah Division of
Air Quality prior to the final approval of a conditional use permit. The air quality permit and application for
the permit shall be incorporated by reference into a conditional use permit and shall be on file with the
City. The permittee shall establish to the satisfaction of the City, and as certified by the City Engineer, the
availability of water sufficient for required dust suppression activities and reclamation. Acceptable opacity
on-site shall be established through the conditional use process and in consultation with the Utah Division
of Air Quality. All equipment and machinery, on-site and off-site, utilized in the excavation and processing
of native natural resources shall be constructed, operated, and maintained in such a manner as to
minimize on-site dust, smoke, and odor, and to minimize off-site drift of dust, smoke, and odor. The
Planning Commission may impose particular conditions to ensure that fugitive dust suppression utilizes
best available control technologies, and to establish air quality and fugitive dust monitoring and reporting
procedures.
5. Water Quality. The washing of sand and gravel shall be done so as to prevent the
discharge of waste water onto any public or private roads or any private property, or into a public or
private river, stream, canal, or waterway, without the written consent of the owner and/or appropriate
local, state, or federal jurisdiction. Water from wash plants shall be collected in evaporating ponds and
shall not be permitted to drain into waterways.
6. Storm Water. The entire area subject to a conditional use permit shall be graded so that
storm water remains on site. The site shall be graded so that as the area is eventually reclaimed, storm
drainage is properly managed in a manner reviewed and approved by the Brigham City Engineer and
Planning Commission. A storm water discharge plan shall be incorporated into the conditional use permit
by reference.
7. Tracking of Material Onto Public Streets. Trucks or other equipment which exit the
operations approved under a conditional use permit, whether owned and operated by the permittee or

others, and whether loaded or unloaded, shall adhere to all laws (State, County, or City) requiring that
loads be contained within the hauling vehicles. All vehicles exiting the operation site, whether owned or
operated by the permittee or others, and whether loaded or unloaded shall be checked for material on the
wheels before leaving the pit. Any material outside a truck or other equipment exiting the operations
approved under a conditional use permit, whether owned or operated by permittee or others, and whether
loaded or unloaded shall be cleaned from the truck or equipment.
8. Hours and Days of Operation. Hours and days of operation shall be established through
the conditional use process as follows:
a) The hours for mining operations, crushing and screening, and hauling, except for the
maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, shall be established during the review of the
applicant’s operation plan but shall not exceed the hours between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., Monday
through Friday, and Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

c) The Planning Commission may vary these days and/or hours of operation in specific
cases upon a finding that unusual circumstances associated with the particular case warrant such a
variance, and upon a finding that no existing or anticipated residential use will be unduly impacted by
such varied hours and/or days of operation.
d) During periods of national or unusual emergency, or in instances of unusual
contractual obligations or other factors, time and hours of operation may be altered at the discretion of,
and following formal approval by, the City Council.
9. Landscaping. Properties containing uses for which a conditional use permit for natural
resource excavation is required shall be landscaped for purposes of screening such uses from public
streets and abutting properties, and providing for site reclamation planting. Vegetative materials shall be
planted together with necessary top soil as per the schedule approved in the granting of the Conditional
Use Permit and shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition. The Reclamation Plan shall include a
landscaping plan prepared by a licensed Landscape Architect, and shall include a planting plan and an
irrigation plan. Landscaping shall be accomplished and maintained in accordance with the approved
Reclamation Plan and the guidelines established in Section 29.28.120 “Reclamation”.
10. Lighting. Reflectors, spotlights, floodlights and other light sources may be used to
illuminate buildings, landscaping, signs, parking, and loading areas, provided they are equipped with
proper lenses or other devices concentrating the illumination upon the building, landscaping, signs,
parking and loading areas, and preventing any bright, direct illumination upon adjacent property or any
public right-of-way. No unshielded lights of any color, reflectors, spotlights, strobe lights, or searchlights
shall be located in such a manner that they are pointed toward or are directly visible from frequently
traveled public rights-of-way or adjacent properties.
11. Noise.
a) Natural resource excavation operations shall be performed in such a manner that
noise emissions do not exceed the following dB A levels at the boundary of the parcel containing the
operation:
Zoning of adjacent property Day time 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Night time 7:00 p.m. to 6:00
a.m. (only when night
operations are previously
approved as specified above).
Multiple Use Zoned 50 dB A 40 dB A
Residentially or
Agriculturally Zoned
50 dB A 40 dB A
Commercially Zoned 60 dB A 55 dB A
Industrially Zoned 80 dB A 75 dB A
b) Blasting and/or the use of explosives of any kind are strictly and completely
prohibited.
c) Best available control technologies shall be used to minimize noise and vibration
from being perceptible on adjacent property.
d) Strobe lights shall be used instead of backup alarms when it is dark to mitigate noise
impacts on the surrounding properties.
12. Haul Roads. All permanent haul roads, and temporary haul roads within five hundred feet
of public streets, shall be regularly surfaced with asphalt or oil, and all permanent or temporary roadways
Page 29.28-7
shall be regularly watered, swept, or surfaced with a dust palliative. Any haul road accessing a public
street, or a State or Federal road or highway, shall be approved by UDOT and the Planning Commission
prior to construction.
13. Traffic. Trucks or other equipment which exit onto a City street from the operations
approved under a conditional use permit, whether owned and operated by the permittee or others, and
whether loaded or unloaded, shall travel only on truck routes established by ordinance. The Planning
Commission may establish conditions mitigating the impact of traffic on City streets, school zones, and
pedestrian routes. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on hours of truck traffic,
restrictions on vehicle size, and restrictions on speed.
A traffic study shall be required as part of a Mining Operations Plan submittal. The traffic
study shall address the following issues:
a) Identify peak volumes.
b) Identify measures to mitigate traffic impacts during critical school times.
c) Projected traffic generated by the operation.
d) Projected traffic levels on routes traveled by traffic generated by the operation.
Traffic and speed shall be monitored over the first year of operations, and the Planning
Commission shall conduct a review of traffic routing following the first year of operation. At that time, the
Planning Commission may establish additional conditions related to transportation and any such
conditions shall become binding on the permittee, the property owner or owners, and any successors.
14. Related Manufacturing Operations. The manufacture of concrete building blocks or other
similar items, the production or manufacture of lime products, the production of ready-mixed concrete, the
production of asphalt mixes and any similar production or manufacturing processes which might be
related to an excavation operation shall not be permitted in association with such an operation, except as
expressly provided by a conditional use permit under this Chapter.
15. Monumentation. Monuments or other means of identification shall be placed and
maintained around the perimeter of the excavation site so as to enable reasonable identification of the
property line separating the excavation property from adjoining land owners.
29.28.120. Reclamation.
A. The Objectives of Excavation Reclamation Shall Be:
1. To return the land, concurrently with the mining operation or within a reasonable amount
of time thereafter to a predetermined condition defined by the reclamation plan as submitted and
approved, compatible with past, present, or probable future local land uses, and consistent with the
Brigham City General Plan.
2. To minimize or prevent present and future on-site or off-site environmental degradation to
the ecological and hydrological regimes caused by mining operations, and to meet other pertinent state
and federal regulations regarding air and water quality standards and health and safety criteria.
3. To minimize or prevent present and future hazards to public safety and welfare.
4. To ensure that the area of excavation shall be rehabilitated to a condition of practical
usefulness and reasonable physical attractiveness.
B. Simultaneous Excavation and Reclamation.
1. The reclamation or rehabilitation of natural resources sites with a projected life of more
than one year shall be carried out simultaneously with the excavation of the resource. The purpose and
intent of simultaneous excavation and reclamation includes but is not limited to the creation of a usable
land resource and the elimination of waste heaps, and the prevention of shallow, stagnant, small bodies
of water, small unusable remnants of land, and eroding, barren slopes all normally associated with open
pit operations, except as providing storm water detention facilities as described in a hydrological report.
2. Excavations shall be planned so as to progressively develop the proposed final land
forms by grading and by stockpiling overburden materials in areas designated for future land forms or in
excavations where the material will be spread over the pit floor where no future excavation is anticipated.
Such areas are to be seeded and planted immediately after grading is completed or within appropriate
planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and planting shall be completed within one year. The
reclamation plan shall contain a description of the phased reclamation process throughout the anticipated
life of the mine.
C. Final Reclamation. Final reclamation shall begin immediately for any site where operations
authorized under a conditional use permit have been abandoned for a period of at least one (1) year, or
otherwise terminated, as determined by the Community Development Department. The final reclamation
shall conform to the plan approved (including approved modifications) in the conditional use permit for
natural resource excavation. All reclamation plans shall conform at least to the below listed minimum
standards and requirements listed elsewhere in the Ordinance; provided however, that the Planning
Page 29.28-8
Commission may require more stringent standards where special hazards exist in order to protect the
health, safety, or general welfare of the public, and to prevent injury to property or improvements.
1. Grading. Slopes, overburden stockpiles, and abandoned soil piles shall be graded and
smoothed so as to control erosion and prevent the creation of potentially dangerous areas in accordance
with the direction of the City Engineer. The peaks and depressions of the reclamation area shall be
reduced to a surface which will result in topography in substantial conformity to the land area generally
surrounding and which will minimize erosion due to rainfall. In no case shall any slope of a reclamation
site exceed the normal angle of repose of the material involved.
2. Water-filled areas. All excavations which create standing water or ponds shall be refilled
with inert materials. This requirement shall not apply, however, to any water-filled excavations scheduled
to become an integral part of the final reclamation plan. The rehabilitation of these areas shall be done in
such a manner that the groundwater is not polluted as determined through consultation with the Box Elder
County Health Department. Fill material shall be porous to allow for water dispersion unless otherwise
specified in the reclamation plan.
3. Landscaping. Unless inconsistent with the final proposed use of the reclaimed land, the
excavated areas and all other disturbed areas shall be replanted and maintained with trees, shrubs,
grasses, or other vegetative ground cover, native to the area, in order to minimize erosion and to restore
the land to a natural appearance, or to an appearance previously approved by the Planning Commission.
4. Removal of Buildings and Equipment. Upon termination of excavation and/or
manufacturing, all buildings, equipment (including electrical conduits), temporary structures (except
fences), rock piles, rubble heaps, or other debris used in the excavation and/or mining operations, shall
be removed unless deemed necessary to the approved final use of the reclaimed site. If determined by
the City Engineer and Community Development Department to be acceptable, these materials may be
back-filled into the excavation.
5. In the final year of excavation, the mining operation may, as part of the reclamation
project, excavate closer than forty feet (40’) to any property lines, but only upon a showing of compelling
mutual good and the approval of the Planning Commission.
D. Reclamation Verification. At the conclusion of mining operation and reclamation of the
excavation site, the Community Development Department and City Engineer shall present to the Planning
Commission a statement verifying the permit area has been reclaimed in compliance with the
requirements of this Ordinance and reclamation plans previously submitted in compliance with this
Ordinance. The Planning Commission shall certify to the City Council that all requirements of this
Ordinance have been met.
29.28.130. Provision of Surety.
A. Provision of Surety Before Operations Begin. After receiving notification that the application
for a natural resource permit has been approved, but prior to commencement of such operation, the
operator shall provide surety to the City, in a form and amount to be determined by the Planning
Commission in consultation with the City Engineer.
B. Amount of Surety. In determining the amount of surety to be provided, the Planning
Commission shall consider factual information as to the magnitude, type, and costs of approved
reclamation activities planned for the land affected and the nature, extent, and duration of operations
under the approval notice. The Planning Commission shall fix the amount of the bond at an amount
reasonably related thereto, to protect the City and insure compliance with the requirements of the
conditional use permit; however, the amount of the bond shall not exceed one hundred and twenty-five
percent (125%) of the estimated cost of rehabilitating the excavation. The bond shall be periodically
reviewed to insure that the amount of the bond is capable of insuring adequate reclamation.
C. Form of Surety. In determining the form of surety to be provided by the owner, the Planning
Commission shall approve a method acceptable to the owner and consistent with the requirements of this
Ordinance which may be one or a combination of corporate surety bond, land, cash or other deposited
securities.
D. Release of Surety. The liability under surety provisions shall continue until such time as it is
released as to part, or in its entirety, by the City Council.
E. Forfeiture of Surety. If the operator fails or refuses to carry out the necessary land
reclamation as outlined in the approved operation and reclamation plans, the Planning Commission may,
after notice and hearing, declare any surety filed for this purpose forfeited, or in case of a corporate bond
file suit against the owner and his bonding company. The City shall also have the right to file suit against
the defaulting permittee for costs of rehabilitation and reasonable attorney’s fees.

Structures, or Yard Space. ........................................................................................................................ 1
29.30.010. Purpose and Intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to allow persons residing in dwellings to use their
mental or physical expertise and talent in providing a service, developing a product for sale to the public,
operating certain kinds of small businesses or maintaining a professional or business office work space in
the dwelling, or in an attached or detached garage or accessory building, or yard space, while at the
same time maintaining the peace, quiet and domestic tranquility within all residential areas of Brigham
City, guaranteeing to all residents freedom from excessive noise, traffic, nuisances, hazards, and other
possible adverse effects of limited business activities being conducted in such areas, and improving and
maintaining the aesthetic quality of the neighborhood and the lot or parcel upon which the dwelling and
home occupation are located. It is further the purpose and intent of this chapter that home occupations
shall be clearly accessory and subordinate to the principal use of the property for dwelling purposes.1
29.30.020. Standards for Home Occupations.
The following standards shall be observed in the operation of all home occupations:
A. The home occupation shall be conducted primarily by residents of the premises. A home
occupation may have employees, however, only one (1) employee who does not live in the home may
come to the home at any one time for purposes of employment, unless otherwise approved by the
Planning Commission. One (1) additional off-street parking stall shall be provided for any employee
coming to the home who is not a resident of the premises. This parking stall shall be subject to setback
standards for the zoning district in which the home occupation is located. 2
B. The home occupation shall not physically change the dwelling or accessory structure or
attached or detached garage or yard space to the extent that it would alter the residential or aesthetic
character of the dwelling, accessory structure, attached or detached garage, yard, or neighborhood.
C. The home occupation shall be allowed one name plate sign which shall be consistent with
Chapter 29.27 Sign Regulations. Temporary signs shall not be permitted for home occupations. 3
D. The home occupation shall not generate pedestrian or vehicular traffic in excess of that
customarily associated with the zone in which the use is located, as determined by the Community
Development Department and appropriate regulatory authorities. Occupancy load as defined by the
currently adopted Uniform Building Code shall not be exceeded.
E. The home occupation shall not cause a demand for municipal or utility services or community
facilities in excess of those usually and customarily provided for residential use, as determined by the
Community Development Department and appropriate regulatory authorities. No electrical equipment
shall be permitted which exceeds three (3) horsepower.
F. Sale of commodities produced on the premises shall be permitted. The sale of commodities
not produced on the premises shall be by prior individual invitation only.
G. Home occupations shall conform to business license requirements of Title 14 of the Brigham
City Code.
H. There shall be complete conformity with all applicable City, County, State and Federal laws
and ordinances.
29.30.030. Standards for Home Occupations Using Attached or Detached Garages, Accessory
Structures, or Yard Space.
A. The use of an accessory structure or an attached or detached garage, or yard space, for a
home occupation may be considered as a conditional use only under the following conditions:
1 Ordinance No. 00-32, dated 8/17/00.
2 Ordinance No. 02-08, dated 3/7/02.
3 Ordinance No. 01-22, dated 4/19/01.
Page 29.30-2
1) The Planning Commission finds that the proposed home occupation will be clearly
accessory and subordinate to the principal use of the property for dwelling purposes; and
2) The Planning Commission finds that the proposed home occupation will not adversely
affect the residential nature and aesthetic quality of the neighborhood; and
3) Any off-street parking displaced by the home occupation is relocated elsewhere on the lot
or parcel in compliance with setback standards for the zoning district in which the property is located; and
4) The Planning Commission may impose any conditions it deems necessary to mitigate
impacts of the home occupation on the neighborhood; and
B. In determining whether to grant a conditional use approval for the use of an attached or
detached garage, accessory structure, or yard space for a home occupation, the Planning Commission
shall consider the effect of such use on the residential character of the property upon which the home
occupation is proposed to be located. In making a determination, the Planning Commission may consider
factors including, but not limited to, displacement of normally residential functions of yard space and
building or structure usage; the potential for generation of noise, dust, vapors, fumes, odors, and light; the
potential for generation of excess traffic; the potential impact of the proposed home occupation on the
aesthetic quality of the neighborhood and the property upon which the home occupation is proposed to be
located.
C. Due to the special nature of home occupations, their potential to create adverse impacts to
the neighborhood, and the potential for significant unforeseen impacts to occur, the Planning Commission
reserves the right to review any home occupation granted conditional use approval pursuant to this
paragraph. The conditional use permit for the home occupation may be reviewed and modified or revoked
by the Planning Commission due to failure of the owner or operator of the home occupation to observe all
conditions specified in issuing the permit, failure to observe the purpose and intent of this Chapter, other
requirements of this Title in regards to the maintenance of improvements, conduct of the home
occupation as approved, or significant unforeseen impacts resulting from the operation of the home
occupation in conflict with the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
D. Home occupations which may be considered under Section 29.30.020 of this Chapter may
include the following uses or uses which are similar in character, origin, or impact, as determined by the
Community Development Department:
1. Artist, Author;
2. Architectural service;

29.32.010. Purpose and Interpretation. 1
A. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide specific regulations for the placement, construction
and modification of commercial personal wireless telecommunications facilities on public and private
property, and in the public right-of-way.2 The provisions of this Chapter are not intended to and shall not
be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services,
nor shall the provisions of this Chapter be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate
between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent that any provision
or provisions of this Chapter are inconsistent or in conflict with any other provision of the City Code or any
ordinance of the City, the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed to control.
B. In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under this Chapter made by
an applicant to provide commercial personal wireless service or to install commercial personal wireless
service facilities, the Planning Commission shall act within a reasonable period of time after the request is
duly filed with the City, taking into account the nature and scope of the request, and any decision to deny
such a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
C. Should the application of this Chapter have the effect of prohibiting a person or entity from
providing commercial personal wireless service to all or a portion of the City, such provider may petition
the City for an amendment to this Chapter. The City, upon receipt of such a petition, shall promptly
undertake review of the petition pursuant to the standard procedure for amendment of the Zoning
Ordinance in accordance with State Law and City ordinances, and shall make a determination on the
petition within a reasonable period of time, taking into account the nature and scope of the petition, and
any decision to deny such petition shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in
a written record.

29.32.030. Policy Statement.
The Planning Commission and City Council have on occasion and with increasing frequency
received requests to site communications towers and antennas. The purpose of this Chapter is to
3 Ordinance No. 14-14, dated 11/6/14
4 Ordinance No. 04-09, dated 3/4/04.
5 Ordinance No. 14-14, dated 11/6/14
6 Ordinance No. 04-09, dated 3/4/04.
Page 29.32-3
establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this Chapter are to: (i)
encourage the location of towers on public property and in non-residential areas and to minimize the total
number of towers throughout the City, (ii) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sties,
(iii) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the
adverse impact on the City is minimal, (iv) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in
a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and (v) enhance the ability of
the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services throughout the City quickly,
effectively, and efficiently. Accordingly, the City Council finds that the promulgation of this Chapter is
warranted and necessary:
A. To manage the location of towers and antennas in the City and encourage the use of public
property for the placement thereof;
B. To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers, including
support structure failure and falling ice;
C. To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design, siting, landscape
screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
D. To accommodate the growing need for towers;
E. To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of existing and new towers as a primary
option rather than construction of additional single-use towers, and to reduce the number of such
structures needed in the future.
F. To consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent allowed by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996;
G. To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna support structure failure and
falling ice, through engineering and proper siting of antenna support structure.
New Uses. All new antennas shall comply with this ordinance after the date of passage.
Existing Uses. All towers existing on the date of passage of this ordinance shall be allowed to
continue their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing
towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers shall comply with the
requirements of this Chapter.
29.32.040. Industry Site Selection Criteria.
In siting a new antenna, the industry requires a location that is technically compatible with the
established network. A general area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the
desired area of service. Specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following
criteria which are not listed in order of priority:
A. Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone
service.
B. Availability of road access.
C. Availability of electric power.
D. Availability of land-based telephone lines or microwave link capability.
E. Leasable lands, and landlords who want facilities to be located on their properties consistent
with zoning regulations.
F. Screening potential of existing vegetation, structures and topographic features.
G. Zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities.
H. Compatibility with adjacent land uses.
I. The least number of sites to cover the desired area.
J. The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical requirements.
K. Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact.
L. Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting.
29.32.050. City Site Selection Criteria.
As a fundamental element of this Chapter, the telecommunications company proposing to
construct an antenna support structure, or mount an antenna on an existing structure, is required to
demonstrate, using technological evidence, that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order to
satisfy its function in the company’s grid system. Further, the company must demonstrate by
technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the cell site’s
function within the grid system.
Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates that it
is either an FCC licensed telecommunications provider or has in place agreements with an FCC licensed
telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure.
Low power mobile radio service facilities should be located and designed to minimize any
adverse effect they may have on residential property values. Sites should be placed in locations where
Page 29.32-4
the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of
screening. Sites should be located on bare ground without visual mitigation only in MD and MG Districts,
based on the design standards articulated in this Chapter.
Location and design of sites in all Districts should consider the impact of the site on the
surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district. In residential districts and
residential land use areas, the minimum lot size for commercial communications towers shall be three (3)
acres.
29.32.060. Priorities.
The following establishes the order of priorities for locating new communications facilities:
A. Place antennas and towers on public property.
B. Place antennas and towers in districts zoned MD or MG.
C. Place antennas and towers in districts zoned GC which do not adjoin or adversely impact
residential neighborhoods.
D. Place antennas on appropriate existing structures, such as buildings, communications
towers, water towers, and smokestacks in other zoned districts.
E. Place antennas and towers on other private nonresidential property.
F. Place antennas and towers in:
1. Residential districts only if the installation is a small cell facility, or7 locations for which a
need has been demonstrated are not available on existing structures or in nonresidential districts; and
2. Only on or in existing churches, parks, schools, utility facilities or other public facilities.
An applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a residential zoning district shall
demonstrate that a diligent effort has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a
government structure, a private institutional structure, or other appropriate existing structures within a
non-residential zoning district, and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints, and
economic or technological feasibility, no appropriate location is available. The telecommunications
company is required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures within a one (1) mile
radius of the site proposed, asked for permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was
denied for reasons other than economic ones. The information submitted by the applicant shall include a
map of the area to be served by the tower, its relationship to other antenna sites in the applicant’s
network, and an evaluation of existing buildings taller than twenty feet (20’), communications towers and
water tanks within one (1) mile of the proposed tower. The requirements in this paragraph do not apply to
a small cell network or facility.8
Priority of Users.
Priority for the use of City owned land for antennas and towers will be given to the following
entities in descending order:
A. City of Brigham City.
B. Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, fire, and ambulance services, which are
not part of the City of Brigham City and private entities with a public safety agreement with the City of
Brigham City.
C. Other governmental agencies, for uses which are not related to public safety.
D. Entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication services including cellular,
personal communication services (PCS), specialized mobilized raid (SMR), enhanced specialized
mobilized raid (ESMR), paging, and similar services that are marketed to the general public.
29.32.065. Use of City Owned Property. 9

antenna owner’s expense.
G. The applicant must reimburse the City for any costs which the City incurs because of the
presence of the applicant’s antennas or tower.
H. The applicant must obtain all necessary land use approvals.
I. The applicant will cooperate with the City’s objective to promote co-locations and thus limit
the number of separate antenna sites requested unless co-location is demonstrated to be infeasible or
otherwise not in the best interest of the City. The number of separate antennas in small cell networks
need not be limited so long as the small cell network meets the concentration standards provided in
Section 29.32.080(B)(5)below.
Special Requirements
The use of certain City owned property, such as water tower sites and parks, for antennas or
towers brings with it special concerns due to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of antennas
or towers on these special City owned sites will be allowed only when the following additional
requirements are met:
A. Water Tower or Reservoir Sites - The City’s water towers and reservoirs represent a large
public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves. Protection of the quality of
the City’s water supply is of prime importance to the City. As access to the City’s water storage systems
increase so too the potential for contamination of the public water supply is increased. For these reasons,
the placement of antennas or towers on water tower or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the City
is fully satisfied that the following requirements are met:
1. The applicant’s access to the facility will not increase the risks of contamination to the
City’s water supply.
2. There is sufficient room on the structure and/or on the grounds to accommodate the
applicant’s facility.
3. The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or reservoir maintenance
cost to the City.
4. The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of workers maintaining the
water tower or reservoir.
B. Parks - The presence of certain antennas or towers represent a potential conflict with the
purpose of some City owned parks. In no case shall towers be allowed in designated conservation areas
unless they are to be installed in areas which currently contain tower facilities. Antennas or towers will be
considered only in the following parks after the recommendation of the Planning Commission and
approval of the City Council: 10
1. Public parks of a sufficient scale and character that are adjacent to an existing
commercial or industrial use;
2. Commercial recreation areas and major play field; and
3. Park maintenance facilities.
11C.Power Poles and/or Light Poles – the City owns and operates an electrical utility. As a public
power provider, the City necessarily owns and manages a substantial number of poles. This inventory of
poles represents a significant investment on the part of the City for the purpose of deploying a system
that delivers an essential electrical service to its resident’s and customer’s primary considerations in the
use of these poles includes safety and security of City personnel, efficient and effective operation of the
City’s electrical utility, and the provision of electrical service to the City’s residents and customers. Cityowned
power and/or light poles also provide access for telephone services, telecommunications services,
and cable television services. Attachment of antennas to City-owned power and/or light poles will be
allowed only when the City is fully satisfied that the following requirements are met:
1. The attached antenna is a small cell facility.
2. The applicant’s attachment of an antenna to the pole will not increase the risk of harm or
injury to City staff or personnel of other users of the pole.
10 Ordinance No. 16-01, dated 01/21/16
11 Ordinance No. 14-14, dated 11/06/14
Page 29.32-6
3. The applicant’s attachment of an antenna to the pole will not harm the City’s ability to
provide electrical service to its residents and customers.
4. There is sufficient room on the pole to accommodate the applicant’s facility.
5. The presence of the facility will not increase the electrical utility’s maintenance cost to the
City.
6. The presence of the facility will not interfere with other valid, existing pole attachments.
7. The applicant has entered into a pole attachment agreement with the City.
8. The applicant has obtained a franchise agreement with the City, if applicable.
Application Process
All applicants who wish to locate an antenna or tower on City owned property must submit to the
Community Development Department a complete application and detailed plan that complies with the
submittal requirements of this Chapter, the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance, General Plan and
other regulations and ordinances of the City along with other pertinent information requested by the City.
Small cell facilities may be considered for attachment on City owned power and/or light poles subject to
execution of an appropriate pole attachment agreement. 12
Termination
The City Council may terminate any lease if it determines that any one of the following conditions
exist:
A. A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate location and the potential
use would be incompatible with the existing use;
B. A user’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of higher priority,
regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately predicted in the technical analysis; or
C. A user violates any of the standards in this Chapter or the conditions attached to the City’s
lease, pole attachment, or other authorization.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended termination and the
reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for the user to address the City Council regarding the proposed
action. This procedure need not be followed in emergency situations.
Reservation of Right
Notwithstanding the above, the City Council reserves the right to deny, for any reason, the use of
any or all City owned property, including power and/or light poles, by anyone or all applicants.
29.32.070. Co-Location; Use of Public Property.
To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, co-location of
antennas by more than one carrier on existing or new towers and location of such antennas on public
property shall take precedent over the construction of new single-use towers as follows:
A. Proposed antenna may, and are encouraged to, co-locate onto existing towers. Provided
such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with the policy, design criteria, and
landscape/screening provisions contained in this Chapter, then such co-locations are permitted by right
and new or additional special use approval is not required, except that any other permit, license, lease, or
franchise requirements must be satisfied.
B. The conditional use requirement for an antenna may be waived in nonresidential zones if the
applicant locates the antenna on an existing structure other than an existing tower and/or if the antenna is
proposed to be located on suitable public property such as a water tower, government building, or other
public tower or pole. Suitability of public property shall be determined at the City’s sole discretion. The
applicant must submit detailed plans to the Community Development Department for an administrative
review to determine if the conditional use permit process and public hearing can be waived. No building
permit will be issued until approval is granted through the administrative review.
C. The City may deny the application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a
good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing structure and/or public property.
D. In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the City in the future,
any new proposed support structure shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user,
unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or physical
reasons.
E. Unless co-location has been demonstrated to be infeasible, the site plan shall delineate an
area near the base of the tower to be used for the placement of additional equipment buildings for other
12 Ordinance No. 14-14, dated 11/6/14
Page 29.32-7
users. The site plan for towers in excess of one hundred feet (100’) must propose space for two
comparable tower users while the site plan for towers under one hundred feet (100’) must propose space
for one comparable tower user. To provide further incentive for co-location as a primary option, an
existing tower may be modified or reconstructed to accommodate the co-location of an additional
antenna, provided the additional antenna shall be of the same type as that on the existing tower. This is
permitted by right for existing towers in all zoning districts, subject to the following criteria being met:
1. Height: an existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed
twenty feet (20’) over the tower’s existing height, to accommodate the co-location of an additional
antenna. The height change may occur only once per tower.
2. Onsite Location: A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-location of an
additional antenna may be moved onsite within fifty feet (50’) of its existing location so long as it remains
within the same zone and complies with the other provisions of this Chapter. After the tower is rebuilt to
co-location, only one (1) tower may remain on site.
29.32.080. Design Criteria.
A. As provided above, new towers shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more than
one (1) user, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical
or physical reasons.
B. Facilities should be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses in
the zoning district or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
1. Setback. Tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property
line of the parcel on which it is located. Unless there are unusual geographical limitations as determined
in the City’s sole discretion, in residential districts and residential land use areas, where permitted, towers
shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to three hundred percent (300%) of tower height
as measured from ground level. Towers shall comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area
in which they are located in all other zoning districts.
2. Color. Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or background that
minimizes their visibility, unless a different color is required by the FCC or FAA.
3. Lights, Signals and Signs. No signals, lights or signs shall be permitted on towers unless
required by the FCC or the FAA. Should lighting be required, at the time of construction of the tower in
cases where there are residential users located within a distance which three hundred percent (300%) of
the height of the tower from the tower, then dual mode lighting shall be required from the FAA.
4. Equipment Structures. Ground level equipment and buildings and the tower base shall be
screened from public streets and residentially zoned properties. The standards for the equipment
buildings are as follows:
a) The maximum floor area is three hundred feet (300’) and the maximum height is
twelve feet (12’).
b) Ground level buildings shall be screened from adjacent properties by landscape
plantings, fencing or other appropriate means, as specified herein or in the City Code.
c) Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the exterior
building walls. Equipment for roof mounted antenna may also be located within the building on which the
antenna is mounted.
Equipment buildings, antenna and related equipment shall occupy no more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total roof area of a building.
Antenna or equipment buildings not meeting these standards require a special exception. The
use must be approved on a comprehensive sketch plan or final development plan, as applicable.
5. Concentration of Small Cell Facilities. In order to avoid excessive concentration of small
cell facilities on City owned power and/or light poles, such facilities shall be located no closer than 500
feet (500’) to any other small cell facility in the same small cell network, provided that small cell networks
approved through a conditional use permit may include more highly concentrated small cell facilities when
the applicant demonstrates that the proposed locations are needed to adequately serve the coverage
area.13
C. Federal Requirements. All towers and antennas, including small cell facilities, must meet or
exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are
changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Chapter shall bring such towers
and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within three (3) months of the
13 Ordinance No. 14-14, dated 11/6/14
Page 29.32-8
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with
such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna
at the owners’ expense.
D. Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a
tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable City building
codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association
(“EIA”), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower fails to comply
with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty
(30) days, the City may remove such tower at the owner’s expense.
E. Structural Design. Towers shall be constructed to the EIA Standards, which may be amended
from time to time, and all applicable construction/building codes. Further, any improvements and/or
additions to existing towers shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a professional
engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA Standards and all other good industry practices in
effect at the time of said improvement or addition. Said plans shall be submitted to and reviewed at the
time building permits are required.
F. Fencing. A well-constructed masonry or stone wall in all zones except MD, MG, M-U-40, MU-
80, or M-U-160, or chain link in MD, MG, M-U-40, M-U-80, OR M-U-160 zones, not less than eight (8’)
feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around each tower. Access to the tower shall be
through a locked gate.
G. Antenna height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna is the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily. No antenna that is taller than this minimum height shall be approved.
H. Antenna support structure safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed antenna
and support structure are safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support
structure failure, falling ice or other debris or interference. All support structures shall be fitted with anticlimbing
devices, as approved by the manufacturers.
I. Required parking. If the cell site is fully automated, adequate parking shall be required for
maintenance workers. If the site is not automated, arrangements for adequate off-street parking shall be
made and documentation thereof provided to the City. Security fencing should be colored or should be of
a design which blends into the character of the existing environment.
J. Antenna Criteria. Antennas on or above a building shall be subject to the following:
1. The antenna must be architecturally compatible with the building and wall on which it is
mounted and designed and located so as to minimize any adverse aesthetic impact.
2. The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in a configuration as flush
to the wall as technically possible and shall not project above the wall on which it is mounted unless for
technical reasons the antenna needs to project above the roof line. In no event shall an antenna project
more than ten feet (10’) above the roof line.
3. The antenna shall be constructed, painted or fully screened to match as closely as
possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which it is mounted.
4. The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical equipment enclosure
which projects above the roof of the building, but may not project any higher than the enclosure.
5. If an accessory equipment shelter is present, it must blend with the surrounding buildings
in architectural character and color.
6. The structure must be architecturally and visually (color, size, bulk) compatible with
surrounding existing buildings, structures, vegetation and/or uses or those likely to exist under the terms
of the underlying zoning. Such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually compatible if they
are camouflaged to disguise the facility.
7. Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the site as
much as possible. Existing vegetation should be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing
topography of the site should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of
the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual mitigation techniques must be evaluated by
City, in City’s sole discretion, taking into consideration the site as built.
8. On buildings thirty feet (30’) or less in height, the antenna may be mounted on the roof it:
a) The City finds that it is not technically possible or aesthetically desirable to mount the
antenna on a wall.
b) No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of the building to exceed
the limitations set forth herein.
c) The antenna or antennas and related base stations cover no more than an aggregate
total of twenty-five percent (25%) of the roof area of a building.
Page 29.32-9

Landscaping, as described herein, shall be required to screen as much of the support structure
as possible, the fence surrounding the support structure and any other ground level features (such as a
building), and in general soften the appearance of the cell site. The City may permit any combination of
existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they
achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted flush on an
existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure, or if the antenna is part of a
small cell network, landscaping shall not be required.
Screening. The visual impacts of a tower shall be mitigated through landscaping or other
screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures. The following landscaping and
Page 29.32-10
buffering of towers shall be required around the perimeter of the tower and accessory structures, except
that the standards may be waived by the City for those sides of the proposed tower that are located
adjacent to undevelopable lands and lands not in public view. Landscaping shall be installed on the
outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and
may be used as a substitute for or in supplement towards meeting landscaping requirements.
A. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of ten feet (10’) tall at planting a maximum of six feet (6’)
apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence;
B. A continuous hedge at least thirty six inches (36”) high at planting capable of growing to at
least forty-eight inches (48”) in height within eighteen (18) months shall be planted in front of the tree line
referenced above.
29.32.120. Non-Use/Abandonment.
In the event the use of any tower or small cell facility has been discontinued for a period of sixty
(60) consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of
abandonment shall be made by the City which shall have the right to request documentation and/or
affidavits from the tower or small cell facility owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon
such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional sixty (60) days within which
to:
A. Reactivate the use of the tower or small cell facility or transfer the tower to another
owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower or small cell facility; or
B. Dismantle and remove the tower or small cell facility. If such tower or small cell facility is not
removed within said sixty (60) days, the City may remove such tower or small cell facility at the owner's
expense. If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower or small cell facility, then this provision shall
not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
At the earlier of sixty (60) days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon
completion of dismantling and removal, City approval for the tower shall automatically expire.
29.32.130. Application Requirements.

applications filed thereafter.
O. Small Cell Network Permit. At the wireless service provider’s discretion, a consolidated
application for a small cell network, or portion of a small cell network, may be submitted for the City’s
permitted use/site plan review process as an alternative to individual permitting for each small cell facility
in a small cell network. The consolidated application shall be reviewed in a single permitted use/site plan
review process that includes review of all required land use permits for all sites within the proposed small
cell network. 14
29.32.140. Third Party Review.
The personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analysis tools, including
geographically based computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of personal
wireless services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna
configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In certain instances there may be a
need for expert review by a third party of the technical data submitted by the personal wireless services or
low power mobile radio service provider. The City Council or the Planning Commission may require such
a technical review, to be paid for by the applicant for the personal wireless services or low power mobile
radio service facilities. The selection of the third party expert may be by mutual agreement among the
applicant and City or at the discretion of the City, with a provision for the applicant and interested parties
to comment on the proposed expert and review its qualifications. The expert review is intended to be a
site-specific review of technical aspects of the personal wireless services or low power mobile radio
service facilities and not a subjective review of the site selection. Such a review should address the
accuracy and completeness of the technical data, whether the analysis techniques and methodologies
are legitimate, the validity of the conclusions and any specific technical issues outlined by the City
Council, Planning Commission, City Staff, or interested parties. Based on the results of the third party
review, the City may require changes to the application for the personal wireless services or low power
mobile radio service facilities that comply with the recommendations of the expert. The expert review of
the technical submission shall address the following:
A. The accuracy and completeness of submissions;
B. The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;
C. The validity of conclusions reached;
D. Any specific technical issues designated by the City.
29.32.150. Severability.
Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this Chapter shall be
declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or
unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases
or word of this Chapter, all of which will remain in full force and effect.

29.35.010. Purpose.
To permit potential nuisances from industrial or other uses to be measured factually and
objectively in terms of the potential nuisance itself; to ensure that all uses will provide necessary control
methods for protection from hazards and nuisances which can be prevented by modern processes of
control and nuisance elimination; to protect any use from arbitrary exclusion based solely on the
characteristics of uncontrolled production in this type of use in the past.
29.35.020. General Provisions.
No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create
dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive, or other hazard; noise or
vibration, smoke, dust, odor, or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness, glare, electrical or other
disturbance; liquid or solid refuse or wastes; or other substance, condition or element in such a manner or
in such an amount as to affect adversely the surrounding area or adjoining premises. The foregoing are
hereinafter referred to as "dangerous or objectionable elements". No use shall be undertaken or
maintained unless it conforms to the regulations of this Section in addition to the regulations set forth for
the district in which such use is situated.
29.35.030. Performance Standards Procedure.
The Community Development Director or designee may require performance standards review
for any use in any district when he has reason to believe that such use, or the manner of its operation will
not or may not conform to the performance standards of this Chapter.
29.35.040. Enforcement Provisions Applicable to All Uses.
Initial and continued compliance with performance standards is required of every use; and
provisions for enforcement of continued compliance with said standards shall be invoked by the zoning
administrator against any use if there are reasonable grounds to believe that performance standards are
being violated by such use.
29.35.050. Nonconforming Uses.
For purposes of this Ordinance, any use established before the effective date of this Ordinance
and nonconforming as to performance standards shall have five (5) years in which to conform therewith.
29.35.060. Locations Where Determinations are to be made for Enforcement of Performance
Standards.
The determination of the existence of dangerous and objectionable elements shall be made at the
location of the use creating the same and at any points where the existence of such elements may be
most apparent; provided, however, that the measurements having to do with noise, odors, vibration, or
glare shall be taken at the following points of measurement:
A. In any district, except an M-District, at the lot line of the establishment or use.
B. In an M-District at one or more points five hundred feet (500’) from the establishment or use,
or at the boundary or boundaries of the District, if closer to the establishment or use, or at the closest
point within an adjacent district other than an M-District.

Chapter 33.01. General Provisions.
33.01.010. Declaration of Findings and Intent.
A. Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way. Brigham City (City) finds that the rights-of-way within the
City:
1. are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social
life of the City;
1 Entire Chapter adopted by Ordinance No. 98-37, 8/20/98
Page 33-2
2. are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that
intent;
3. can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities
delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and
general economic well-being of the City and its citizens; and
4. are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize
the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the
inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities’ construction, placement,
relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of way.
B. Findings Regarding Compensation. The City finds that the right to occupy portions of the
rights-of-way for limited times for the business of providing telecommunications services is a valuable use
of a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the City and its
taxpayers, and, therefore, the taxpayers of the City should receive fair and reasonable compensation for
use of the rights-of-way.
C. Findings Regarding Local Concern. The City finds that while telecommunication systems are
in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal
franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
D. Findings Regarding Promotion of Telecommunications Services. The City finds that it is in the
best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications
services, on a nondiscrimination basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure
availability for municipal, educational and community services.
E. Findings Regarding Franchise Standards. The City finds that it is in the interests of the public
to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
1. fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
2. encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may
use valuable public property to serve the public;
3. fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that may flow from such
commercial use of rights-of-way;
4. protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of the City, in a
manner consistent with federal and state law;
5. otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the City
infrastructure;
6. protects the public’s investment in improvements in the rights-of-way; and
7. ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that
such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
telecommunication services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”) [P.L. No.
104-104].
8. complies with Utah Code 10-1-401 et seq and Utah Code 72-7-102(4). 2
F. Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The City adopts this Telecommunications Ordinance
pursuant to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and
statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights-of-way by
providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act.
33.01.020. Scope of Ordinance.
This Chapter shall provide the basic local framework for providers of telecommunications services
and systems that require the use of the rights-of-way, including providers of both the system and service,
those providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide
services. This Chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the City prior to the
effective date of this Chapter, whether operating with or without a franchise as set forth in Chapter
33.01.170(b).
33.01.030. Excluded Activity.
A. Cable TV. This Chapter shall not apply to cable television operators otherwise regulated by
pre-existing franchise agreements with Brigham City.
B. Wireless Services. This Chapter shall not apply to personal wireless service facilities except
in the public right-of-way or public utility easement.
2 Ordinance No.14-13, 11/06/14
Page 33-3
C. Provisions Applicable to Excluded Providers. Providers excused by other law that prohibits
the City from requiring a franchise shall not be required to obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements
imposed by this chapter through the exercise of the City’s police power and not preempted by other law
shall be applicable.

a provider within the City that the provider is authorized to provide under federal, state and local law, and
any equipment and/or facilities required for and integrated with the services provided within the City,

33.01.050. Franchise Required.
A. Non-Exclusive Franchise. The City is empowered and authorized to issue non-exclusive
franchises governing the installation, construction, operation, use and maintenance of systems in the
City’s rights-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a
franchise agreement entered into between the City and provider.
B. Every Provider Must Obtain. Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, every
provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications system or providing
telecommunications services, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open
video system or providing open video services via an open video system and shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies. The fact that
particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to
obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable
system must obtain a cable franchise, and should it intend to provide telecommunications services over
the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
C. Nature of Grant. A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way. A
franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-way on a non-exclusive basis for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased. A
franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements
before collocating its system on the property of others, including the City’s property. This section shall not
be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has
obtained a franchise.
D. Current Providers. Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting
without a franchise on the effective date of this chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the City
within 90 days of the effective date of this chapter. If such request is made, the provider may continue
providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations
cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of Section 33.01.090.
E. Nature of Franchise. The franchise granted by the City under the provisions of this chapter
shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, operate, repair, maintain,
Page 33-5
remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services, in
compliance with all other applicable laws and ordinances.
F. Regulatory Approval Needed. Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the
franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for
the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the City upon the written request of the City evidence of all such approvals,
permits, authorizations or licenses.
G. Term. No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than five (5)
years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner.
33.01.060. Compensation and Other Payments.
A. Compensation. As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to
this chapter, a provider shall have the following obligations:
B. Application Fee. In order to offset the cost to the City to review an application for a franchise
and in addition to all other fees, permits or charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of
application, $500 as a non-refundable application fee. An application fee shall also be paid when an
amendment to an application is filed with the City.
C. Excavation permits. The provider shall also pay fees required for an excavation permit as
provided in Chapter 24.03.050 Excavations.
D. Right-of-Way Fees. The right-of-way fee, if any, shall be set forth in the franchise agreement.
The obligation to pay a right-of-way fee shall commence on the completion date. 3
E. Timing. Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all right-of-way fees shall be
paid on a monthly basis within forty-five (45) days of the close of each calendar month.
F. Fee Statement and Certification. Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each fee
payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated and
shall be certified as to its accuracy.
G. Future Costs. A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties, at the direction of the City, an
amount equal to the reasonable costs and expenses that the City incurs for the services of third parties
(including but not limited to attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or providerinitiated
re-negotiation, transfer, amendment or other modification of this chapter or a franchise, provided,
however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. Any
costs associated with any work to be done by the Power and Public Works Department to provide space
on City owned poles shall be borne by the provider.
H. Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing
authorities, other than the City on the use of the City property as a result of a provider’s use or occupation
of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such taxes,
payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter.
I. Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any payment is not actually received by the City
on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until
received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
J. No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the City of any fee shall be construed as an
accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment
be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
K. Not in Lieu of Other Taxes or Fees. The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee
or other assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable law. By
way of example, and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the City owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
L. Continuing Obligation and Holdover. In the event a provider continues to operate all or any
part of the system after the term of the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all
applicable provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation, provided that any such
continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as
a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation after the
term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
M. Costs of Publication. A provider shall assume any publication costs associated with its
franchise that may be required by law.

granted pursuant to this chapter, an application must be filed with the City on the form attached to this
Chapter as Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated by reference.

4. prior to making any attachments to poles, the willingness to enter into a pole attachment
agreement with the City.
C. Franchise Determination. The City, in its discretion, shall determine the award of any
franchise on the basis of these and other considerations relevant to the use of the rights-of-way, without
competitive bidding.
33.01.080. Construction and Technical Requirements.
A. General Requirements. No provider shall receive a franchise unless it agrees to comply with
each of the terms set forth in this Section governing construction and technical requirements for its
system, in addition to any other requirements or procedures specified by the City or the franchise,
including requirements regarding co-location and cost sharing. A provider shall obtain an excavation
permit, pursuant to the excavation ordinance, before commencing any work in the rights-of-way.
B. Quality. All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade and
removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and reliable manner using materials of good
and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by
federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system, including, without
limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or within the system, is harmful to the public health,
safety or welfare, or quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
promptly correct all such conditions.
C. Licenses and Permits. A provider shall have the sole responsibility for diligently obtaining, at
its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or other forms of approval or authorization necessary to
construct, operate, maintain, upgrade or repair the system, including but not limited to any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the City to use private property, easements, poles and conduits. A
provider shall obtain any required permit, license, approval or authorization, including but not limited to
excavation permits, pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for
which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
33.01.090. Relocation of the System
A. New Grades or Lines. If the grades or lines of any rights-of-way are changed at any time in a
manner affecting the system, then a provider shall comply with the requirements of the excavation

other emergency, as determined by the City in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the
system and appurtenances on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City, in which event the City shall
not be liable therefor to a provider. The City shall notify a provider in writing prior to, if practical, but in any
event as soon as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any action taken
under this section. Notice shall be given as provided in Section 33.01.160(D).
C. A Provider Required to Temporarily Move System. A provider shall, upon prior reasonable
written notice by the City or any person holding a permit to move any structure, and within the time that is
reasonable under the circumstances, temporarily move any part of its system to permit the moving of said
structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the City for any such
movement of its systems.
D. Rights-of-Way Change - Obligation to Move System. When the City is changing a right-ofway
and makes a written request, a provider is required to move or remove its system from the right-ofway,
without cost to the City, to the extent provided in the excavation ordinance. This obligation exists
whether or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
E. Protect Structures. In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair,
upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all
Page 33-7
existing structures belonging to the City. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the City to
alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or any other municipal structure on,
over or under the rights-of-way of the City required because of the presence of the system. Any such
alteration shall be made by the City or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees that it
shall be liable for the costs incurred by the City to replace or repair and restore to its prior condition in a
manner as may be reasonably specified by the City, any municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of
the City involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system
that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of a provider
pursuant to the franchise.
F. No Obstruction. In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, upgrade, repair
or removal of the system, a provider shall not unreasonably obstruct the rights-of-way of fixed guide way
systems, railways, passenger travel, or other traffic to, from or within the City without the prior consent of
the appropriate authorities.
G. Safety Precautions. A provider shall, at its own cost and expense, undertake all necessary
and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its work sites, including the placing and maintenance of
proper guards, fences, barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such other
requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply with all applicable federal,
state and local requirements including, but not limited to, the National Electric Safety Code.
H. Repair. After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the sole determination of the
City, an eminent danger exists, any rights-of-way within the City which are disturbed or damaged during
the construction, operation, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by
the provider of its system may be repaired by the City at the provider’s expense, to a condition as good as
that prevailing before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall submit to such a provider
an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the rights-of-way intruded upon. The provider
shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the statement, pay to the City the entire amount thereof.

33.01.110. Trimming of Trees.
A provider shall have the authority to trim trees, in accordance with all applicable utility
restrictions, ordinance and easement restrictions, and subject to Chapter 24.01.030, upon and hanging
over rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with its system.

A. Notification of Sale.
1. PSC Approval. When a provider is the subject of a sale, transfer, lease, assignment,
sublease or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale,
consolidation or otherwise, such that it or its successor entity is obligated to inform or seek the approval
of the PSC, the provider or its successor entity shall promptly notify the City of the nature of the
transaction and, if applicable, request a transfer of the franchise to the successor entity. A request for a
transfer shall include a certification that the successor entity unequivocally agrees to all of the terms of
the original provider’s franchise agreement.
2. Transfer of Franchise. Upon receipt of a request to transfer a franchise, the City
designee, as provided in Subsection 33.01.140(A)(1), may send notice approving the transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the City has
reason to believe that the successor entity may not comply with this chapter or the franchise agreement, it
may require an application for the transfer. The application shall comply with Section 33.01.050.
B. If PSC Approval is No Longer Required. If the PSC no longer exists, or if its regulations or
state law no longer require approval of transactions described in Section 33.01.120(A), then the following
events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of the franchise requiring compliance
with Section 33.01.120(A):
Page 33-8

other equity interests in a provider by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or
other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a provider;
3. the issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity
interest by a provider so as to create a new controlling interest in such a provider; or
4. the entry by a provider into an agreement with respect to the management or operation of
such provider or its system.

of the franchise and shall obtain and provide proof of the insurance coverage required by the franchise. A
provider shall also indemnify the City as set forth in the franchise.
B. Oversight. The City shall have the right to oversee, regulate and inspect periodically the
construction, maintenance, and upgrade of the system, and any part thereof, in accordance with the
provisions of the franchise and applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to prove, in reasonable
detail, to the satisfaction of the City at all times throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with
the franchise. A provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of limitations.
C. Maintain Records. A provider shall at all times maintain:
1. On file with the City, a full and complete set of plans, records and “as-built” hard copy
maps and, to the extent the maps are placed in an electronic format, they shall be made in electronic
format compatible with the City’s existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the
types of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights-of-way, properly identified and
described as to the types of equipment and facility by appropriate symbols and marks which shall include
annotations of all rights-of-way where work will be undertaken. As used herein, “as-built” maps include file
construction prints. Maps shall be drawn to scale. “As-built” maps, including the compatible electronic
format, as provided above, shall be submitted within 30 days of completion of work or within 30 days after
completion of modification and repairs. “As-built” maps are not required of the provider who is the
incumbent local exchange carrier for the existing system to the extent they do not exist.
2. Throughout the term, a provider shall maintain complete and accurate books of account
and records of the business, ownership, and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a
manner that allows the City at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the City reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such a
manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the books and/or records are maintained so that a
provider comes into compliance with this Section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that regulates utilities in the
State of Utah, and generally accepted accounting principles shall be deemed to be acceptable under this
Section.
D. Confidentiality. If the information required to be submitted is proprietary in nature or must be
kept confidential by federal, state or local law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall
be treated as a protected record within the meaning of the Utah Government Records Access and
Management Act (“GRAMA”), making it available only to those who must have access to perform their
duties on behalf of the City, provided that a provider notifies the City of, and clearly labels the information
which a provider deems to be confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and labeling shall be
the sole responsibility of the provider.
E. Provider’s Expense. All reports and records required under this chapter shall be furnished at
the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise provided in this chapter or a franchise.

obligations required by this Chapter or a franchise is prevented by a cause or event not within a provider’s
control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of a
provider shall include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, failure

the date of such expiration or revocation. A provider shall continue to operate its system under the terms
and conditions of this Chapter and the franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter.
2. Continuation by Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier. If the provider is the incumbent local
exchange carrier, it shall be permitted to continue to operate its system and provide services without
regard to revocation or expiration, but shall be obligated to negotiate a renewal in good faith.
D. Removal or Abandonment of Franchise Property.
1. Abandoned System. In the event that (1) the use of any portion of the system is
discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, and thirty (30) days after no response to
written notice from the City to the last known address of provider; (2) any system has been installed in the
rights-of-way without complying with the requirements of this Chapter or franchise; or (3) the provisions of
Section 33.01.050 are applicable and no franchise is granted, a provider, except the provider who is an
incumbent local exchange carrier, shall be deemed to have abandoned such system.
2. Removal of Abandoned System. The City, upon such terms as it may impose, may give a
provider written permission to abandon, without removing, any system, or portion thereof, directly
constructed, operated or maintained under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless
otherwise provided in this Chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the abandoned
system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any affected rights-of-way to their former
state at the time such system was installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense any excavation necessarily made by it
and shall leave all rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without
materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments.
The City shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the rights-of-way cables, wires,
attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this
Chapter and any security fund provided in a franchise shall continue in full force and effect during the

granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as provided for by this Chapter, in any such case
without renewal, extension or transfer, the City shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all above-ground portions of a system from the rights-of-way within a reasonable period of time,
which shall not be less than one hundred eighty (180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local
exchange carrier, it shall not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good faith.
5. Leaving Underground System. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in place so long as it does not materially
interfere with the use of the rights-of-way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or
other person. A provider shall not damage a system or otherwise make or render the system unusable by
the City or any other provider prior to abandoning the system.

33.01.160. General Provisions.
A. Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this Chapter and a franchise
entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this Chapter shall control.
B. Severability. If any provision of this Chapter is held by any federal, state or local court of
competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state statute, or is ordered by a court
to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and all appellate
remedies with regard to the validity of the Chapter provisions in question are exhausted, such provision
shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this Chapter, and such holding shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law is
subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision which had been
held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law the provision in question shall return to full
force and effect and shall again be binding on the City and the provider, provided that the City shall give
the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of time as may be reasonably required for a provider to
comply with such a rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring compliance with
such provision.
C. New Developments. It shall be the policy of the City to liberally amend this Chapter, upon
application of a provider, when necessary to enable the provider to take advantage of any developments
in the field of telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more effectively,
efficiently, or economically serve itself or the public.
D. Notices. All notices from a provider to the City required under this Chapter or pursuant to a
franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter shall be directed to the officer as designated by the Mayor. A
provider shall provide in any application for a franchise the identity, address and phone number to receive
notices from the City. A provider shall immediately notify the City of any change to its name, address, or
telephone number.

federal and state statutes.
B. Ordinance Applicability. This Chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after
the effective date of this Chapter. This Chapter shall further apply, to the extent permitted by applicable
federal or state law to all existing franchises granted prior to the effective date of this Chapter and to a
provider providing services, without a franchise, prior to the effective date of this Chapter.
C. Other Applicable Ordinances. A provider’s rights are subject to the police power of the City to
adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the public. A provider shall
comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to its police powers.
In particular, all providers shall comply with the City zoning and other land use requirements.
D. City Failure to Enforce. A provider shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of
the provisions of this Chapter or any franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter by reason of any failure of
the City to enforce prompt compliance.
E. Construed According to Utah Law. This Chapter and any franchise granted pursuant to this
Chapter shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Utah.
Chapter 33.02. Small Wireless Facilities. 4
33.02.010. Purpose.
A. General Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide specific regulations for the colocation
of small wireless facilities and installation, replacement, and modification of utility poles and
wireless support structures for co-locating small wireless facilities by wireless service providers in the
right-of-way. The provisions of this chapter are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to authorize or
prohibit or to have the effect of authorizing or prohibiting the provision of wireless services or authorizing
any other communications service, nor shall the provisions of this chapter be applied in such a manner as
to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent wireless services. To the extent
that any provision or provisions of this chapter are inconsistent or in conflict with any other provision of
the City Code or any ordinance of the City, the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed to control. This
4 Chapter adopted with Ord. No. 19-06, 2/15/2019
Page 33-11
Chapter does not apply to any facilities that are not wireless facilities, including, but not limited to, wireline
backhaul facilities.
