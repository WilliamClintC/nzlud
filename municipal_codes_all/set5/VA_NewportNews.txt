PREFACE 
As adopted in 1978, this Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Newport News of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. The Code was republished in the 8½ by 11 format in 1989, and included ordinances through Ordinance No. 3906-89, enacted June 27, 1989. Subsequently, the Code was republished in 2005 and included ordinances through Ordinance No. 6143-05, enacted July 12, 2005. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the recodification were the 1961 Newport News Code, as supplemented through September 27, 1976, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1961 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President, and Anne Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout both the recodification and the republication projects. 
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Leonard E. Ringler, Deputy City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on the republication project. It is hoped that these efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

After the conclusion of the public hearing on the general budget, the council may insert new items of expenditures or may increase, decrease or strike out items of expenditure in the general fund budget, except that no item of expenditure for debt service as required by law shall be reduced or stricken out. The council shall in no event adopt a general budget in which the total expenditures exceed the revenues, estimated as hereinbefore provided, unless at the same time it adopts measures for providing additional revenue in the ensuing fiscal year, estimated as hereinbefore provided, sufficient to make up the difference. 
(Acts 1980, Ch. 78, § 1)

(b)  The city council finds that attendance of members of appointed bodies are an important and necessary component of service on same and that failure of a member of an appointed body to attend scheduled meetings of his or her appointed body affects the ability of that appointed body to conduct its public business. Attendance data shall be compiled by the chairman or other designated officer of the appointed body and reported by him or her to the city clerk on a monthly basis. Such data shall be a factor utilized by city council when it considers an individual for removal, appointment or reappointment to an appointed body. A member of an appointed body who is unable to attend a meeting of that body shall notify the chairman or other designated officer thereof of that impending absence prior to the date of the appointed body's meeting. 
(c)  Irregular attendance. During the city's fiscal year, if any member's attendance at regularly scheduled meetings of that appointed body shall be deemed to be irregular attendance, such occurrences shall give rise to the presumption that such member has voluntarily resigned from that appointed body.

(1)  During that fiscal year of the city, once any member incurs two (2) unexcused absences from regularly scheduled meetings of his or her appointed body the chairman or other designated officer thereof shall cause a letter to be written to the member who has incurred two (2) unexcused absences, requesting that the member advise the chairman or other designated officer of the member's intent with reference to future attendance at meetings of the appointed body. 
(2)  If the member provides a written statement to the chairman or other designated officer of the appointed body indicating a desire to continue to serve on said appointed body, the chairman or other designated officer shall report same to the city clerk who shall write to said member who experienced two (2) unexcused absences, and remind that member that a third such unexcused absence will be deemed to be a voluntary resignation. 
(3)  If the member does not communicate with the chairman or other designated officer of the appointed body prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the appointed body, the chairman or other designated officer thereof shall so notify the city clerk. The city clerk shall thereafter notify the city council of the attendance issue; provided that the city clerk shall send a copy of that correspondence to said member. The city council shall take such action with reference to the attendance issue as the city council in its sole discretion deems appropriate. 
(d)  Consistent absence. During the city's fiscal year, if any member's attendance at regularly scheduled meetings of that appointed body shall be deemed to be a consistent absence, such occurrences shall give rise to the presumption that such member has voluntarily resigned from that appointed body. Prior to a determination that the member has voluntarily resigned from that appointed body, the following shall occur: 
(1)  The chairman or other designated officer of the appointed body shall cause a letter to be written to such member who has incurred two (2) consecutive unexcused absences from two (2) regularly scheduled meetings requesting that the person advise the chairman or other designated officer of the member's intent with reference to future attendance at meetings. 
(2)  If the member provides a written statement of the member's intent to cease attending and to officially resign as a member of that appointed body, the chairman or other designated officer shall so notify the city clerk and provide the city clerk with a copy of that written statement. The city clerk shall thereafter request in writing that the city council appoint a new member to the affected appointed body; provided that the city clerk shall send a copy of that correspondence to said member. 
(3)  If the member provides a written statement to the chairman or other designated officer of the appointed body indicating a desire to continue to serve on said appointed body, the chairman or other designated officer shall report same to the city clerk who shall write to said member who incurred two (2) unexcused absences, and remind that member that a third unexcused absence will be deemed to be a voluntary resignation. 
(4)  If the member does not communicate with the chairman or other designated officer of the appointed body prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the appointed body the chairman or other designated officer thereof shall notify the clerk of such occurrence. The city clerk shall thereafter notify the city council in writing of the attendance issue; provided that the city clerk shall send a copy of that correspondence to said member. The city council shall take such action with reference to the attendance issue as the council in its sole discretion deems appropriate.

f.  Speakers shall confine their comments to matters germane to the business of the City Council of the City of Newport News.

If the electronic device is not available, speakers will be advised when their three (3) minutes have concluded. Speakers cannot "transfer" nor "designate" their time to another speaker in an effort to provide another speaker more than the allotted three (3) minutes on any agenda item or when making comments on matters germane to the business of city council. After a speaker has concluded his or her remarks, the speaker should return to his or her seat unless a member of city council indicates that he or she has a question to address to the speaker.

Nor do these regulations preclude those addressing city council from using a chart or graph during their verbal presentation. 
c.  The mayor or other presiding officer shall preserve decorum and shall decide all questions of public order.

(1)  All officers and employees of the City of Newport News who are former members of the Armed Services or members of the organized reserve forces of any of the Armed Services of the United States, National Guard, or naval militia shall be entitled to leaves of absence from their respective duties, without loss of seniority, accrued leave, or efficiency rating, on all days during which they are engaged in federally funded military duty, to include training duty, or when called forth by the governor pursuant to Sections 44-75.1 or 44-78.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. There shall be no loss of regular employer pay during such leaves of absence, except that paid leaves of absence for federally funded military duty, to include training duty, shall not exceed fifteen (15) workdays per federal fiscal year, and except that no officers or employees shall receive paid leave for more than fifteen (15) workdays per federally funded tour of active military duty.

If the office or position has been abolished or otherwise ceased to exist during such leave of absence, they shall be reinstated in a position of like seniority, status and pay, if the position exists, or in a comparable vacant position for which they are qualified, unless to do so would be unreasonable. For the purposes of this section, with respect to employees of the City of Newport News who do not normally work approximately equal workdays on five (5) or more days of each calendar week, the term "workday" shall mean one-two hundred sixtieth ( 1/260 ) of the total working hours such employee would be scheduled to work during an entire federal fiscal year, not taking into account any state or city holidays, paid medical leave, paid personal leave, military leaves, or other absences.

(2)  All non-temporary officers and employees of the City of Newport News who enter upon military active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States of America, other than as provided for in subsection (1) shall be granted military active duty leave, without pay, in accordance with applicable federal laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, Title 38, The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, of the United States Code.

e.  Receipt of full payment for compensatory time accrued prior to entry upon active duty. Compensatory time shall not be carried over until reemployment by the city, nor shall compensatory time accrue during a period of military active duty leave. 
f.  Although paid personal leave shall not accrue during such time as an employee is on military active duty leave, such employee's paid personal leave accrual rate shall be calculated to include the period of active duty service upon reemployment with the city pursuant to the requirements of Title 38 of the United States Code. 
g.  Although unused paid medical leave shall be forfeited upon entry on military active duty leave, and no paid medical leave shall accrue during such period, prior unused paid medical leave shall be reinstated upon reemployment by the city pursuant to the requirements of Title 38 of the United States Code.

The commission and participating commission employees may each pay a portion of the premium or the commission may pay the entire amount. The total amount shall be determined annually by the city manager. The total of commission and employees' contributions shall be sufficient, on a pro rata basis, to fund all claims, reserves and administration costs of the group health insurance contracts or plans and the dental insurance plan.

Sec. 2-167. - Supplemental compensation during a period of temporary total disability and alternative employment. 
(a)  Any current employee of the city who is unable to perform his duties due to an occupational injury or disease and who is drawing temporary total disability benefits as provided by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act shall be eligible to receive supplemental compensation during the two-year period immediately following the date of injury by accident or diagnosis of disease. Such supplemental compensation shall be calculated as the difference between his pre-injury or pre-diagnosis net rate of pay, at the date of his disability, and the workers' compensation indemnity benefit. The maximum number of hours for which such supplemental compensation may be paid is one thousand forty (1040) hours. 
(b)  The supplement provided for by this section shall be coordinated with any hours worked in the city's alternative employment program. Any employee who is assigned a light duty job under the alternative employment program due to a condition that would otherwise entitle him to indemnity benefits under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act within the two-year period immediately following the date of injury or diagnosis of disease may receive his pre-injury or pre-diagnosis net rate of pay for up to two thousand eighty (2080) hours of the alternative employment. The supplementation to net rate of pay provided by subsection (a) and (b) shall not exceed a combined total of two thousand eighty (2080) hours. The "net rate of pay" is defined as "gross pay, less federal tax, social security tax and state income tax deductions, calculated on an hourly basis." 
(c)  If an employee is eligible for and receiving workers' compensation indemnity benefits, he may not supplement the benefit with any accrued paid leave unless otherwise mandated by state law. No supplemental compensation provided by this section shall be paid for any period beyond two (2) years from the date of the injury by accident or diagnosis of disease. 
(d)  In the event an employee shall resign, abandon or be discharged from his employment, the compensation fixed by this section shall cease from and after such date, and thereafter the employee shall receive only such compensation as is prescribed by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act.

ARTICLE V. - EMPLOYEE GRIEVANCES[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 4250-91, adopted Aug. 27, 1991, amended Art. V to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Art. V, §§ 2-1812-187, 2-1912-194, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 3521-86 and Ord. No. 3701-88. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of inclusion of Ord. No. 4250-91. 
State Law reference Duty of city to establish employee grievance procedure, Code of Virginia, § 15.2-1506. 
 
Sec. 2-181. - Policy. 
It is the policy of the City of Newport News to encourage resolution of employee problems and complaints in an environment wherein employees may freely discuss their concerns with immediate supervisors and upper management. However, to the extent that such concerns cannot be resolved by other means, a grievance procedure is established to afford an immediate method for the resolution of disputes which may arise between the city and its employees. An employee filing a grievance or participating in the grievance of another employee may follow the grievance procedure with complete freedom from reprisal. 
(Ord. No. 4250-91)  
Sec. 2-182. - Definition of grievance. 
A grievance is a complaint or dispute of an employee relating to his or her employment, including but not necessarily limited to: 
(1)  Disciplinary actions including disciplinary demotions, suspensions and dismissals, provided that dismissals shall be grievable when they result from formal discipline or unsatisfactory job performance; 
(2)  The application of personnel policies, procedures, rules and regulations; 
(3)  Discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, political affiliation, age, disability, national origin or sex; and 
(4)  Acts of retaliation initiated as a result of the employee's use of or participation in the grievance procedure; or because the employee has complied with any law of the United States or of the Commonwealth of Virginia, has reported any violation of any such law to a government authority, has sought any change in law before the Congress of the United States or the General Assembly; or has reported an incidence of fraud, abuse or gross management. 
In grievances brought under paragraphs cited above, the employee must state specific facts and circumstances in the grievance to support his or her complaints of grievability. Mere allegation of such actions or circumstances will not support grievability. 
(Ord. No. 4250-91; Ord. No. 4925-96, § 1)  
Sec. 2-183. - Management rights and non-grievable issues. 
Management reserves the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of the city. Included are the rights to establish job duties, job descriptions and job requirements, to assign and direct the work of employees, to determine the methods, means and personnel by which work activities are to be carried out, to establish personnel and operating policies, procedures, rules and regulations, to hire, promote, transfer, assign and retain employees, to establish standards for acceptable performance and conduct, and to establish wages and salaries, position classifications and general benefits. Therefore the following complaints are not grievable: 
(1)  Establishment and revision of wages and salaries, position classifications or general benefits; 
(2)  Work activity accepted by the employee as a condition of employment or work activity which may reasonably be expected to be a part of job content; 
(3)  The content of ordinances, statutes or established personnel policies, procedures, rules and regulations; 
(4)  Failure to promote except where the employee can show established promotional policies or procedures were not followed or applied fairly; 
(5)  The methods, means and personnel by which city operations are to be conducted; 
(6)  Except where such action affects an employee who has been reinstated within the previous six (6) months as the result of the final determination of a grievance, termination, layoff, dismissals or suspension from duties because of a lack of work, a reduction in work force, or job abolition; 
(7)  Employee performance evaluations; 
(8)  The hiring, promotion, transfer, assignment and retention of employees by the city; and 
(9)  The relief of employees from duties in emergencies. 
In any grievance brought under the exception in paragraph (6) above, the action shall be upheld upon a showing by the city that: (i) there was a valid business reason for the action and (ii) the employee was notified of such reason in writing prior to the effective date of the action. 
(Ord. No. 4250-91)  
Sec. 2-184. - Coverage of personnel. 
All regular full time and part-time employees covered by the Classification and Pay Plan of the City of Newport News are eligible to file grievances in accordance with this policy with the exception of: 
(1)  Employees in the employment probationary period or in a formal extension of the employment probationary period; 
(2)  Appointees of elected groups or individuals; 
(3)  Department heads and assistant city managers; 
(4)  Employees who have resigned may not have access to the grievance procedure after the effective date of the resignation unless the grievance was initiated prior to the effective date of the resignation; 
(5)  Law enforcement officers as defined by Chapter 5 (§9.1-500 et seq.) of Title 9.1 whose grievance is subject to the provisions of Chapter 5 and who have elected to proceed pursuant to those provisions in the resolution of their grievance. A law enforcement officer shall be given written notification of his/her rights to initiate a grievance under this procedure and shall be provided with a copy of this procedure upon request. The law enforcement officer may proceed under either this grievance procedure or under the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 9.1 of the Code of Virginia, but not both. 
(6)  Temporary, limited term and seasonal employees are not eligible to file grievances under this grievance procedure. 
(7)  Employees of the Newport News Department of Social Services are included in this grievance procedure. 
(8)  Employees of constitutional officers are not covered by this procedure; however, these employees may be covered by this procedure if agreed to by both the constitutional officer and city council. 
(Ord. No. 4250-91; Ord. No. 7388-17; Ord. No. 7388-17; Ord. No. 7402-17)  
Sec. 2-185. - Determination of access, grievability and compliance. 
(a)  Determinations of access to the grievance procedure shall be made by the director of human resources in writing to the employee at any time prior to the panel hearing. 
(b)  Determinations of grievability are made by the city manager or designated representative in writing at any time prior to the panel hearing. A copy of the city manager or designee's ruling on the issue of grievability shall be sent to the grievant. 
(c)  Determinations on access and grievability may be appealed to the Circuit Court of Newport News for a hearing on the issues of whether the employee has access to the procedure, and whether the issue is grievable. Proceedings shall be initiated by the grievant by filing a notice of appeal with the city manager or director of human resources within ten (10) calendar days from the date of the receipt of the determination. Within ten (10) calendar days thereafter, the city manager or designee shall transmit to the clerk of the court a copy of the determination of the city manager or designee, a copy of the notice of appeal, and the exhibits. A list of the evidence furnished to the court shall also be furnished to the grievant. The failure of the city manager or designee to transmit the records shall not prejudice the rights of the grievant. The court, on motion of the grievant, may issue a writ of certiorari requiring the city manager or designee to transmit the record on or before a certain date. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such record by the clerk, the court, sitting without a jury, shall hear the appeal on the record transmitted by the city manager or designee and such additional evidence as may be necessary to resolve any controversy as to the correctness of the record. The court, in its discretion, may receive such other evidence as the ends of justice may require. The court may affirm the determination, or may reverse or modify the determination. The decision of the court shall be rendered no later than the fifteenth day from the date of the conclusion of the hearing. The decision of the court is final and is not appealable. 
(d)  Failure of either party to comply with all substantial procedural requirements of the grievance procedure, without just cause will result in a decision in favor of the other party on any grievable issue, provided the party not in compliance fails to correct the noncompliance within five (5) work days of receipt of written notification by the other party of the compliance violation. Such written notification by the grievant shall be made to the director of human resources. The director of human resources or designated representative shall determine compliance and may require a clear written explanation of the basis for just cause extensions or exceptions. Compliance determinations made by the director of human resources or designated representative shall be subject to judicial review by filing a petition with the circuit court within thirty (30) calendar days of the compliance determination. 
(e)  The time periods outlined in this article constitute substantial procedural requirements. However, such time periods may be extended by mutual agreement between the grievant and the appropriate level of management to whom the time period is applicable. Whenever a person is required or permitted under this article to do an act within a prescribed time after receipt of a document, three (3) days shall be added to the prescribed time when the document is served by mail. In addition, if the due date for any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or city holiday, the next business day shall become the due date. Employees have the responsibility to report to their department head for disciplinary meetings when directed to do so. Employees shall make themselves available even when they are on administrative leave. 
(f)  The determination of a complaint as "non grievable" shall not be construed to restrict any employee's right to seek or management's right to provide customary administrative review of complaints outside the scope of the grievance procedure. 
(g)  The human resources department will provide procedural information and guidance to employees and management on issues of access, grievability and compliance. 
(h)  The issues of access and grievability shall be decided prior to the panel hearing or they shall be deemed to have been waived. 
(i)  Date of receipt is determined by the date of hand delivery or by the date indicated by a commercial carrier that delivery was made to the grievant's address on record with the city. 
(Ord. No. 4250-91; Ord. No. 6036-04; Ord. No. 6679-10; Ord. No. 7388-17)  
Sec. 2-186. - Grievance procedure. 
(a)  Management steps. The first four (4) steps of the grievance procedure provide an intermediate process for the resolution of complaints and disciplinary matters. 
(1)  General provisions. 
a.  The first two (2) management steps involve the employee's immediate supervisor. In departments with several levels of supervision, the department may specify the management level designated as the immediate supervisor for grievance purposes. 
b.  In disciplinary matters, Steps I, II and III may be waived by agreement of both the employee and the appropriate levels of management. 
c.  In grievances in which the action grieved (whether disciplinary or otherwise) was action taken by the department head, Steps I and II shall be waived. 
d.  In situations where the employee's immediate supervisor is also the department head, Steps II and III of the procedure shall be combined. 
e.  Personal face-to-face meetings between the appropriate level of management and the employee are required at all steps. 
f.  With the exception of Step IV, the only persons who may normally be present in the management step meetings are the grievant, the appropriate manager at the level at which the grievance is being heard and appropriate witnesses for each side. Witnesses shall be present in the management step meetings only while actually providing testimony. 
At Step IV, the grievant and management may each have present a representative of his or her choice. If the grievant is represented by legal counsel, management likewise has the option of being represented by counsel. When an employee is represented, any cost of representation is at the employee's expense. 
g.  All grievances processed through management Steps II, III, and IV shall be processed on forms provided by the city. The human resources department will provide procedural assistance to both parties in the completion of grievance forms. 
h.  Once a grievance has been reduced to writing, it may not be changed or amended unless agreed to by the grievant and the level of management at that step. Any different or additional grievance issues must be pursued through a separate grievance proceeding. 
i.  Date of receipt is determined by the date of hand delivery or by the date indicated by a commercial carrier that delivery was made to the grievant's address on record with the city. 
(2)  Step I. Any employee who feels aggrieved may bring the situation to the attention of his immediate supervisor, explaining the nature of the problem and his suggested solution. 
It is not necessary for a complaint to be reduced to writing; however, the supervisor should routinely document this action with the assumption that it could be the first step of a formal grievance. Any such complaint or grievance shall be made within twenty (20) calendar days after the event or action which is the basis for the grievance. The supervisor shall give his verbal or written response to the employee within seven (7) calendar days after the situation has been brought to his attention. If no response is given within that seven (7) day period, it shall be deemed denied. 
(3)  Step II. If discussion between the employee and the immediate supervisor fails to settle the matter, the grievance shall be reduced to writing on a grievance form provided by the human resources department. 
The employee must present the written grievance to his supervisor (or the department head when the event or action was taken by the department head) within seven (7) calendar days from the date the supervisor responded. If the supervisor failed to respond at Step I, the employee has seven (7) calendar days from the date the supervisor's response was due to present his written grievance. Once the employee reduces his grievance to writing, he must specify on the grievance form the specific relief he expects to obtain. 
The supervisor or his representative will acknowledge receipt of the grievance form by his dated signature and provide a date and time for the Step II grievance meeting. 
The supervisor or his representative shall then contact the human resources department to obtain a grievance number which he shall write on the grievance form, and then provide a copy of the grievance form to the human resources department. 
The immediate supervisor or his representative shall, within seven (7) calendar days, meet and discuss the grievance with the employee. Within seven (7) calendar days after such meeting, the supervisor or his representative shall respond to the employee in writing on the grievance form, and shall include the date of the meeting and the date of the decision. The immediate supervisor or his representative shall return the grievance form to the grievant who shall sign and date it. The immediate supervisor shall provide a copy of this signed grievance form to the human resources department. 
(4)  Step III. If the response of the immediate supervisor or his representative does not resolve the grievance the employee may appeal to the department head within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the written response of the immediate supervisor or his representative. 
The employee must submit the appeal to the department head in writing on the grievance form. Upon receipt of the grievance form, the department head or his representative should provide a date and time for the Step III grievance meeting, sign and date the form, and provide a copy to the human resources department. 
The department head within seven (7) calendar days, shall meet and discuss the grievance with the employee. Within seven (7) calendar days after such meeting, the department head shall respond to the grievance in writing on the grievance form and include the date of the meeting and the date of the decision. The department head or his representative shall return the grievance form to the grievant who shall sign and date the grievance form. The department head or his representative shall provide a copy of the signed grievance form to the human resources department. 
(5)  Step IV. If the department head's response does not resolve the grievance, the grievant may appeal to the city manager within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the department head's response. 
The employee must submit the appeal to the city manager in writing on the grievance form. Upon receipt of the grievance form, the city manager, an assistant city manager, or their designated representative, should provide a date and time for the Step IV grievance meeting, sign and date the form, and provide a copy to the human resources department. 
The city manager or his designated representative shall, within seven (7) calendar days, meet and discuss the grievance with the employee. Within seven (7) calendar days after such meeting, the city manager or his designated representative shall respond to the grievance in writing on the grievance form and include the date of the meeting and the date of the decision. The city manager or his designated representative shall send a copy of the grievance form to the grievant by hand delivery or by commercial carrier which shall provide delivery confirmation to the grievant's address on record with the city. 
If the city manager's response does not resolve the grievance, the employee may request a panel hearing. 
(b)  Panel hearing. 
(1)  Request for a panel hearing. 
a.  A panel hearing may be requested when the city manager's response in Step IV of the grievance procedure does not resolve the grievance. 
b.  The employee, within seven (7) calendar day of receipt of the decision of the city manager or designated representative, must make a request for a panel hearing to the director of human resources, in writing, on the grievance form and must also submit a panel hearing request form provided by the human resources department. The panel hearing request form shall include the name of the panel member selected by the grievant and the name of the grievant's legal counsel, if any. 
(2)  Panel selection. 
a.  Panel members shall be active, regular full-time employees and shall be selected in the following manner: one (1) selected by the grievant, one (1) selected by the city manager, and the remaining member selected by the two (2) appointees. Selection of the city manager's appointee shall be made within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the request for panel hearing. After the city manager has selected his appointee, the director of human resources or designated representative shall notify the two (2) appointees of their selection. The two (2) panel members shall select a third member within seven (7) calendar days after the notification of their selection as panel members, who shall serve as the chairperson; provided, however, this period may be extended an additional seven (7) calendar days by the two (2) appointees, if necessary. In the event that the agreement cannot be reached as to the final panel member, the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Newport News shall select such third panel member. 
b.  The panel is an impartial body selected to hear and decide the grievance on its merits. Therefore, in order to provide an impartial panel and to ensure the protection of city employees, the following persons may not serve as panel members: 
1.  The following relatives of any participant in the grievance process and the relatives of any participant's spouse: spouse, parent, child, descendants of a child, sibling, niece, nephew and first cousin. 
2.  Supervisors and managers who are in a direct line of supervision of a grievant. Employees in the same department as the grievant may not serve on the panel. 
3.  Any person having direct involvement with the grievance including any representative of the grievant and witnesses who have been involved at the management steps. 
4.  Any attorney having direct involvement with the subject matter or a partner, associate, employee, co-employee or client of such an attorney. 
5.  Employees of the human resources department, the city attorney's office, and the city manager's office. 
6.  Persons who are or have been residents of the same household as the grievant are also prohibited from serving on the panel. 
c.  Any person selected as a panel member may decline appointment in which case the appropriate party must make another selection within seven (7) calendar days of notice to the human resources director or designee that the selected person has declined appointment. 
(3)  Panel procedure. 
a.  The director of human resources, or designated representative, and full panel will coordinate a date and time for the panel hearing. 
b.  All panel hearings shall commence within six (6) months following the date of the Step IV decision unless the grievant and the director of human resources and the city attorney's office, if involved, mutually agree to extend the six (6) month period. 
c.  Parties to the grievance shall not discuss the substance of any grievance or the problem giving rise to the grievance with any panel members prior to the hearing. 
d.  The director of human resources, or designated representative, will coordinate the panel hearing and may correspond with panel members, grievants, the grievant's legal counsel, witnesses and others directly on behalf of the panel. 
e.  The director of human resources, or designated representative, will provide the panel with copies of the grievance record prior to the hearing and provide the grievant with a list of the documents furnished to the panel at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled panel hearing. Documents, exhibits, and a list of witnesses shall be exchanged between the grievant's legal counsel and management's legal counsel at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled panel hearing, unless otherwise agreed. If the grievant is not represented by legal counsel, the parties shall provide such material to the human resources department at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled panel hearing, and human resources will coordinate the exchange of the material. Upon the request of the grievant or his representative, the director of human resources, or designated representative, will also allow the grievant access to and copies of all relevant files intended to be used in the grievance proceeding. 
f.  The director of human resources, with the mutual agreement between the City's representative and the grievant, may extend the time periods applicable to the panel procedures. 
(4)  Conduct of the panel hearing. 
a.  At the request of either the grievant or the city, the hearing shall be private. If private, only the panel members, the grievant, the grievant's legal counsel or other representative, the management representative, management's legal counsel, the witness who is testifying, and the court reporter, if any, shall be present at the hearing. If open, the panel shall nevertheless have full power and authority to close portions of the hearing and to determine what persons not having a direct involvement in the proceedings may remain in the hearing room. Witnesses, other than the grievant and the management representative, shall remain in the hearing room only while giving their testimony. Employees of the human resources department will be present throughout any hearing except when the panel is deliberating. The panel may seek the advice of the director of human resources, or designated representative, on grievance procedure questions. 
b.  The grievant may be represented by legal counsel at his own expense. In the event that the grievant is represented by legal counsel, the city may likewise be represented by counsel. 
c.  The taking of photographs in the hearing room during the progress of the grievance proceedings and the broadcasting of grievance proceedings by radio or television are prohibited. 
d.  The panel shall conduct its hearing with its three (3) members present. 
e.  The panel has the authority to determine the admissibility of evidence without regard to the burden of proof, or the order of presentation of the evidence, so long as a full and equal opportunity is afforded to all parties for the presentation of their evidence. 
f.  At the option of each party, opening statements may be made at the beginning of the hearing setting forth the issue(s) and the panel may ask for such statements in order to clarify the issue(s) involved in the grievance. If opening statements are made, the grievant or the grievant's legal counsel shall begin, followed by the city's legal counsel or the city's designated representative. 
g.  There is no subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses in the grievance procedure. The panel may, however, at the request of either party or in its own discretion, request the voluntary appearance of witnesses. Witnesses shall be permitted in the hearing room only when giving their testimony. The sworn statement of an absent or unavailable witness shall be received as evidence by the panel. 
h.  The panel hearing is an administrative process and is not meant to be conducted like proceedings in court. Panels are not bound by technical rules of evidence and shall take into account all reliable and substantial evidence produced at the hearing. It is within the province of the panel to determine relevancy and materiality. The panel may require either party to demonstrate relevancy and materiality of any evidence and the need for any requested extensions of the hearing panel. 
i.  All evidence shall be presented in the presence of the panel and the parties unless by mutual consent of the parties. The grievant shall present his or her evidence first. 
j.  Evidence may be presented by the grievant along with any exhibits which shall be marked and made a part of the record. The panel may question any witness, including the grievant, and the grievant or his counsel may question any witnesses. The city's designated representative or counsel representing the city may also question witnesses and present evidence in the same manner afforded the grievant. 
k.  The panel shall deal with the grievance before them. Evidence and testimony as to how other employees or situations have been handled in the past are not relevant. No personnel file or record may be examined by the panel or introduced into evidence, except that of the grievant. 
l.  The grievant shall not be permitted to introduce any evidence before the panel which has not been previously presented or submitted during the management steps for management consideration.

Upon receiving negative replies, the hearing shall be closed. Both parties shall be given the opportunity to make closing statements, following which the panel shall retire to begin its deliberation.

The panel shall make its decision within the following standards of review: 
1.  The panel shall uphold the city if the evidence shows that the charges brought pursuant to the Standards of Conduct were reasonable. If the panel finds that the charges were not reasonable, the panel has the same authority and limitations as management to determine the appropriate charges and disciplinary action in accordance with applicable city policy. 
2.  In grievances involving termination for unsatisfactory work performance, failure to meet job standards, unacceptable attendance and job abandonment, the panel shall uphold the city's action if it determines that the action was reasonable under the circumstances. 
3.  In grievances involving complaints regarding application of policy, discrimination and other non-disciplinary issues, the panel will determine if policies and procedures have been appropriately applied. The panel is not empowered to promote, assign or transfer employees, to establish salaries nor to take any other action which is in the purview of management rights. 
4.  The panel does not have the authority to consider determinations of grievability, determinations of access to the grievance procedure, or compliance determinations, made in accordance with section 2-185. 
5.  The majority decision of the panel, acting within the scope of its authority, shall be final, subject to existing policies, procedures and law. In cases of law enforcement officers who have elected to proceed pursuant to § 9.1-504 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, the panel decision is advisory only to the city manager, but shall be accorded significant weight. 
6.  The panel may not award back pay or benefits, damages, or attorney's fees. 
e.  The city manager, after consultation with the director of human resources, has discretion to order all or some back pay and/or benefits to the grievant if the panel finds that the charges or action taken by the city were not reasonable. 
f.  The director of human resources may on his own action remand a decision which appears to be inconsistent with law and written policy to the panel for further consideration. All parties will be notified when a decision is remanded. All three (3) panel members must participate in the decision-making process. 
g.  If either party refuses to implement a panel decision, the other party may petition the Circuit Court of Newport News to enforce the decision.

DIVISION 1. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 2-510. - Finding; vision; purpose. 
The city council has found and determined that support of the city's youth should be a high priority of city government. In particular, the council's vision for youth development in the city is that individuals, neighborhoods, businesses, schools, the faith community, civic organizations, youth and government need to work collaboratively to foster an environment where the city's young people are healthy, educated, respected, valued and empowered so that they may become responsible citizens. The council further has found that in order to provide for the healthy growth and development of children and youth, the city must make families central to its development effort. This article, therefore, implements that judgment and vision by establishing a commission on youth and a mayor's youth commission.

DIVISION 2. - COMPETITIVE BIDDING 
 
Sec. 2-560. - Prequalification generally; prequalification for construction. 
(a)  Prospective contractors may be prequalified for particular types of supplies, services, insurance or construction, and consideration of bids or proposals limited to prequalified contractors. Any prequalification procedure shall be established in writing and sufficiently in advance of its implementation to allow potential contractors a fair opportunity to complete the process. 
(b)  Any prequalification of prospective contractors for construction shall be pursuant to a prequalification process for construction projects adopted by the purchasing agent. 
The application form used in such process shall set forth the criteria upon which the qualifications of prospective contractors will be evaluated. The application form shall request of prospective contractors only such information as is appropriate for an objective evaluation of all prospective contractors pursuant to such criteria. Such form shall allow the prospective contractor seeking prequalification to request, by checking the appropriate box, that all information voluntarily submitted by the contractor pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a trade secret or proprietary information subject to the provisions of section 2-557.2. 
In all instances in which the purchasing agent requires prequalification of potential contractors for construction projects, advance notice shall be given of the deadline for the submission of prequalification applications. The deadline for submission shall be sufficiently in advance of the date set for the submission of bids for such construction so as to allow the procedures set forth in this section to be accomplished. 
At least thirty (30) days prior to the date established for submission of bids or proposals under the procurement of the contract for which the prequalification applies, the purchasing agent shall advise in writing each contractor which submitted an application whether that contractor has been prequalified. In the event that a contractor is denied prequalification, the written notification to such contractor shall state the reasons for such denial of prequalification and the factual basis of such reasons. 
A decision by the purchasing agent denying prequalification under the provisions of this subsection shall be final and conclusive unless the contractor appeals the decision as provided in section 2-576. 
The purchasing agent may deny prequalification to any contractor only if he finds one (1) of the following: 
(1)  The contractor does not have sufficient financial ability to perform the contract that would result from such procurement. If a bond is required to ensure performance of a contract, evidence that the contractor can acquire a surety bond from a corporation included on the United States Treasury list of acceptable surety corporations in the amount and type required by the public body shall be sufficient to establish the financial ability of such contractor to perform the contract resulting from such procurement; 
(2)  The contractor does not have appropriate experience to perform the construction project in question; 
(3)  The contractor or any officer, director or owner thereof has had judgments entered against him within the past ten (10) years for the breach of contracts for governmental or nongovernmental construction, including, but not limited to, design-build or construction management; 
(4)  The contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of prior construction contracts with the city without good cause. If the city has not contracted with a contractor in any prior construction contracts, the purchasing agent may deny prequalification if the contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of comparable construction contracts with another public body without good cause. The purchasing agent may not utilize this provision to deny prequalification unless the facts underlying such substantial noncompliance were documented in writing in the prior construction project file and such information relating thereto given to the contractor at that time, with the opportunity to respond; 
(5)  The contractor or any officer, director, owner, project manager, procurement manager or chief financial official thereof has been convicted within the past ten (10) years of a crime related to governmental or nongovernmental construction or contracting, including, but not limited to, a violation of the following portions of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended: (i) Article 6, (§ 2.2-4367 et seq.) of Title 2.2, (ii) the Virginia Governmental Frauds Act (§ 18.2-498.1 et seq.) of Title 18.2, (iii) Chapter 4.2 (§ 59.1-68.6 et seq.) of Title 59.1, or (iv) any substantially similar law of the United States or another state; 
(6)  The contractor or any officer, director or owner thereof is currently debarred pursuant to an established debarment procedure from bidding or contracting by any public body, agency of another state or agency of the federal government; and 
(7)  The contractor failed to provide to the purchasing agent in a timely manner any information requested by the purchasing agent relevant to subdivisions 1 through 6 of this subsection.

Evaluation of bids shall be based upon the requirements set forth in the invitation, which may include special qualifications of potential contractors, and any other criteria such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery and suitability for a particular purpose, which are helpful in determining acceptability. The city may consider best value concepts when procuring goods and nonprofessional services, but not construction or professional services. The criteria, factors and basis for consideration of best value and the process for the consideration of best value shall be as stated in the procurement solicitation.

Sec. 2-561.4. - Withdrawal of bid due to error. 
(a)  A bidder for a public construction contract, other than a contract for construction or maintenance of public highways, may withdraw his bid from consideration if the price bid was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid within two (2) business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure and shall submit original work papers with such notice. Such mistake shall be proved only from the original work papers, documents and materials delivered as required herein. The work papers, documents, and materials submitted by the bidder shall, at the bidder's request, be considered trade secrets or proprietary information subject to the conditions of section 2-557.2(f). 
(b)  A bidder for a nonconstruction contract may withdraw his bid from consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (a) above. 
(c)  No bid may be withdrawn under this section when the result would be the awarding of the contract on another bid of the same bidder or of another bidder in which the ownership of the withdrawing bidder is more than five (5) percent. 
(d)  If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this section, the lowest remaining bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
(e)  No bidder who is permitted to withdraw a bid shall, for compensation, supply any material or labor to or perform any subcontract or other work agreement for the person or firm to which the contract is awarded or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, from the performance of the project for which the withdrawn bid was submitted. 
(f)  The purchasing agent shall notify the bidder in writing within five (5) business days of his decision regarding the bidder's request to withdraw its bid. If the purchasing agent denies the withdrawal of a bid under the provisions of this section, he shall state in such notice the reasons for his decision and award the contract to such bidder at the bid price, provided such bidder is a responsible and responsive bidder. At the same time that the notice is provided, the purchasing agent shall return all work papers and copies thereof that have been submitted by the bidder.

DIVISION 3. - COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATION 
 
Sec. 2-569. - Competitive negotiation generally. 
Competitive negotiation is a method of source selection which involves individual discussions between the city and the offeror on the basis of responses to the city's request for proposals. The source selection methods of competitive negotiation incorporate sections 2-557.2, 2-560, 2-560.1 and 2-561.1, 2-564 and 2-566.1, in addition to the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1)  
Sec. 2-569.1. - Request for proposals. 
A request for proposals shall be in writing and indicate in general terms that which is sought to be procured, specifying the factors which will be used in evaluating the proposal and containing or incorporating by reference the other applicable contractual terms and conditions, including any unique capabilities or qualifications which will be required of the contractor. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1)  
Sec. 2-569.2. - Public notice. 
At least ten (10) days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals, public notice shall be given by posting on the city's website and the state's department of general services' central electronic procurement website and may be published in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the contract is to be performed so as to provide reasonable notice to the maximum number of offerors that can be reasonably anticipated to submit proposals in response to the particular request. In addition, proposals may be solicited directly from potential contractors. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 5476-00, § 1; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1; Ord. No. 7306-16; Ord. No. 7559-19, § 1)  
Sec. 2-569.3. - Receipt of proposals. 
No proposals shall be handled so as to permit disclosure of the identity of any offeror or the contents of any proposal during the process of negotiation. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1)  
Sec. 2-569.4. - Evaluation factors. 
The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1)  
Sec. 2-569.5. - Discussion with responsible offerors and revision of proposals. 
As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1)  
Sec. 2-570. - Award. 
Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. When the terms and conditions for multiple awards are provided in the request for proposal, awards may be made to more than one (1) offeror. 
(Ord. No. 3910-89; Ord. No. 5476-00, § 1; Ord. No. 7036-14, § 1)  
Sec. 2-570.1. - Contracting for professional services. 
(a)  Competitive negotiation procedure. The purchasing agent shall engage in individual discussions with all offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence to provide the required services. Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. Such offerors shall be encouraged to elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the proposed project as well as alternative concepts. The request for proposal shall not, however, request that offerors furnish estimates of man-hours or cost for services. These discussions may encompass nonbinding estimates of total project costs, including where appropriate, design, construction and life cycle costs. Methods to be utilized in arriving at price for services may also be discussed. Proprietary information from competing offerors shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of discussions, outlined herein, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposals and all information developed in the selection process to this point, the purchasing agent shall select in the order of preference two (2) or more offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract satisfactory and advantageous to the city can be negotiated at a price considered fair and reasonable, the award shall be made to that offeror. Otherwise, negotiations with the offeror ranked first shall be formally terminated and negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked second, and so on until such a contract can be negotiated at a fair and reasonable price. Should the purchasing agent determine in writing and in his sole discretion that only one (1) offeror is fully qualified, or that one (1) offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. Once formally terminated, negotiations may not be reopened with any offeror. 
(b)  Multiphase contracts. Multiphase professional services contracts satisfactory and advantageous to the city for environmental, location, design and inspection work regarding construction infrastructure projects may be negotiated and awarded based on qualifications at a fair and reasonable price for the first phase only, when completion of the earlier phases is necessary to provide information critical to the negotiation of a fair and reasonable price for succeeding phases. Prior to the procurement of any such contract, the city shall state the anticipated intended total scope of the project and determine in writing that the nature of the work is such that the best interests of the city require awarding the contract. 
(c)  Contracting for multiple projects. A contract for architectural or professional engineering services relating to multiple construction projects may be negotiated by the city, for multiple projects provided (i) the projects require similar experience and expertise, (ii) the nature of the projects is clearly identified in the request for proposals, and (iii) the contract term is limited to one (1) year or when the cumulative total project fees reach the maximum cost authorized in this paragraph, whichever occurs first. Such a contract may be renewable for four (4) additional one-year terms at the option of the city. Under such contract, (a) the fair and reasonable prices, as negotiated, shall be used in determining the cost of each project performed; (b) the sum of all projects performed in one (1) contract term shall not exceed six million dollars ($6,000,000.00); and (c) the project fee of any single project shall not exceed two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000.00). Any unused amounts from the first contract term shall not be carried forward to the additional term. Competitive negotiations for such contracts may result in awards to more than one (1) offeror provided (1) the request for proposals so states and (2) the city has established procedures for distributing multiple projects among the selected contractors during the contract term. Such procedures shall prohibit requiring the selected contractors to compete for individual projects based on price.

Sec. 2-570.2. - Contracting for other than professional services. 
Selection shall be made of two (2) or more offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals, on the basis of the factors involved in the request for proposal, including price if so stated in the request for proposal. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the offerors so selected. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole determining factor. After negotiations have been conducted with each offeror so selected, the purchasing agent shall select the offeror which, in his opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that offeror. When the terms and conditions for multiple awards are provided in the request for proposal, awards may be made to more than one (1) offeror. Should the purchasing agent determine in writing and in his sole discretion that only one (1) offeror is fully qualified, or that one (1) offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror.

The purchasing agent is authorized to suspend a person from consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause to believe that the person has engaged in any activity which might lead to debarment. The suspension shall not be for a period of more than three (3) months. The causes for debarment include: 
(1)  Conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of such contract or subcontract; 
(2)  Conviction under state or federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property, or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which currently, seriously and directly affects responsibility as a city contractor; 
(3)  Conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of the submission of bids or proposals; 
(4)  Violation of contract provisions, as set forth below, of a character which is regarded by the purchasing agent to be so serious as to justify debarment action: 
(a)  Deliberate failure without good cause to perform in accordance with the specifications or within the time limit provided in the contract; or 
(b)  A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one (1) or more contracts; provided, that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment; or 
(5)  Any other cause the purchasing agent determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility as a city contractor, including debarment by another governmental entity for any cause mentioned in this section, or for violation of the ethical standards set forth in division 6 of this article.

(a)  Following public opening and announcement of bids received on an invitation to bid, the purchasing agent shall evaluate the bids. At the same time the purchasing agent shall determine whether the apparent low bidder is responsible. If the purchasing agent so determines, then he may proceed with an award in accordance with the provisions of section 2-563. If the purchasing agent determines that the apparent low bidder is not responsible, he shall proceed as follows: 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a written determination of nonresponsibility, the purchasing agent shall (i) notify the apparent low bidder in writing of the results of the evaluation, (ii) disclose the factual support for the determination, and (iii) allow the apparent low bidder an opportunity to inspect any documents which relate to the determination, if so requested by the bidder within five (5) business days after receipt of the notice. 
(2)  Within ten (10) business days after receipt of the notice, the bidder may submit rebuttal information challenging the evaluation. The purchasing agent shall issue his written determination of responsibility based on all information in his possession, including any rebuttal information, within five (5) business days of the date he received such rebuttal information.

No protest shall lie for a claim that the selected bidder or offeror is not a responsible bidder or offeror. The written protest shall include the basis for the protest and the relief sought. The purchasing agent shall issue a decision in writing within ten (10) business days stating the reasons for the action taken. This decision shall be final unless the bidder or offeror appeals within ten (10) days of the written decision by invoking the administrative procedures established by the purchasing agent, if any, or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in section 2-577.1 of this division. 
(b)  If prior to an award it is determined that the decision to award is arbitrary or capricious, then the sole relief shall be a finding to that effect. The awarding authority (city council or purchasing agent) shall cancel the proposed award or revise it to comply with the law. If, after an award, it is determined that an award of a contract was arbitrary or capricious, then the sole relief shall be as hereinafter provided. Where the award has been made but performance has not begun, the performance of the contract may be enjoined. Where the award has been made and performance has begun, the awarding authority (city council or purchasing agent) may declare the contract void upon a finding that this action is in the best interest of the public. Where a contract is declared void, the performing contractor shall be compensated for the cost of performance up to the time of such declaration. In no event shall the performing contractor be entitled to lost profits.

Sec. 2-576.5. - Stay of award during protest. 
An award need not be delayed for the period allowed a bidder or offeror to protest, but in the event of a timely protest, as provided in section 2-576.3, or the filing of a timely legal action as provided in section 2-577.1, no further action to award the contract shall be taken unless there is a written determination by the purchasing agent that proceeding without delay is necessary to protect the public interest or unless the bid or offer would expire.

Pendency of claims shall not delay payment of amounts agreed due in the final payment. 
(b)  A procedure for consideration of contractual claims may be included in each contract. Such procedure, which may be incorporated into the contract by reference, shall establish a time limit for a final decision in writing by the purchasing agent. 
(c)  A contractor may not invoke the administrative procedures established by the purchasing agent, if any, or institute legal action as provided in section 2-577.1 of this division, prior to receipt of the decision on the claim, unless the purchasing agent fails to render such decision within the time specified in the contract. 
(d)  The decision of the purchasing agent shall be final and conclusive unless the contractor appeals within six (6) months of the date of the final decision on the claim by the purchasing agent by invoking the administrative procedures established by the purchasing agent, if any, or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in section 2-577.1 of this division.

Sec. 2-577.1. - Legal actions. 
(a)  A bidder or offeror, actual or prospective, who is refused permission or disqualified from participation in bidding or competitive negotiation, or who is determined not to be a responsible bidder or offeror for a particular contract, may bring an action in the circuit court for the City of Newport News challenging that decision, which shall be reversed only if the petitioner establishes that the decision was arbitrary or capricious, or, in the case of denial of prequalification, that the decision to deny prequalification was not based upon the criteria for denial of prequalification as set forth in subsection 2-560(b). 
(b)  A bidder denied withdrawal of a bid under section 2-576.1 of this Code may bring an action in the circuit court for the City of Newport News challenging that decision, which shall be reversed only if the bidder establishes that the decision was clearly erroneous. 
(c)  A bidder, offeror or contractor may bring an action in the circuit court for the City of Newport News challenging a proposed award or the award of a contract, which shall be reversed only if the petitioner establishes that the proposed award or the award is not an honest exercise of discretion, but rather is arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, applicable law or regulation, or the terms and conditions of the invitation to bid or request for proposal. In the event the apparent low bidder, having been previously determined by the purchasing agent to be not responsible, is found by the court to be responsible, the court may direct the award of the contract to such bidder in accordance with the requirements of this section and the invitation to bid or request for proposal. The provisions of subsection 2-576.3(b) shall apply to any such award. 
(d)  If injunctive relief is granted, the court, upon request of the city, shall require the posting of reasonable security to protect the city. 
(e)  A contractor shall bring an action involving a contract dispute with the city in the circuit court for the City of Newport News. 
(f)  A bidder, offeror or contractor need not utilize the administrative procedures of section 2-577.2 of this Code; but if those procedures are invoked by the bidder, offeror or contractor, the procedures shall be exhausted prior to instituting legal action concerning the same procurement transaction unless the city agrees otherwise. 
(g)  Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the city from instituting legal action against a contractor.

Sec. 2-577.2. - Administrative appeals procedure. 
(a)  The purchasing agent shall establish an administrative procedure for hearing protests of a decision to award or an award, appeals from refusals to allow withdrawal of bids, appeals from disqualifications and determinations of nonresponsibility, actions of debarment or suspension, and appeals from decisions on disputes arising during the performance of a contract, or any of these. Such administrative procedure shall provide for a hearing before a disinterested person or panel, the opportunity to present pertinent information and the issuance of a written decision containing findings of fact. The disinterested person shall not be an employee of the city and no member of the panel shall be an employee of the city. The findings of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the same are fraudulent, arbitrary or capricious, so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith, or in the case of denial of prequalification, such findings were not based upon the criteria for denial of prequalification as set forth in subsection 2-560(b). No determination on an issue of law shall be final if appropriate legal action is instituted in a timely manner. 
(b)  Any party to the administrative procedure, including the city, shall be entitled to institute judicial review if such action is brought within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written decision.

Adequate feed means access to and the provision of food that is of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain each animal in good health; is accessible to each animal; is prepared so as to permit ease of consumption for the age, species, condition, size and type of each animal; is provided in a clean and sanitary manner; is placed so as to minimize contamination by excrement and pests; and is provided at suitable intervals for the species, age, and condition of the animal, but at least once daily, except as prescribed by a veterinarian or as dictated by naturally occurring states of hibernation or fasting normal for the species. 
Adequate shelter means provision of and access to shelter that is suitable for the species, age, condition, size, and type of each animal; provides adequate space for each animal; is safe and protects each animal from injury, rain, sleet, snow, hail, direct sunlight, the adverse effects of heat or cold, physical suffering, and impairment of health; is properly lighted; is properly cleaned; enables each animal to be clean and dry, except when detrimental to the species; during hot weather, is properly shaded and does not readily conduct heat; during cold weather, has a windbreak at its entrance and provides a quantity of bedding material consisting of hay, cedar shavings, or the equivalent that is sufficient to protect the animal from cold and promote the retention of body heat; and for dogs and cats, provides a solid surface, resting platform, pad, floormat, or similar device that is large enough for the animal to lie on in a normal manner and can be maintained in a sanitary manner. Under this chapter, shelters whose wire, grid, or slat floors: (i) permit the animals' feet to pass through the openings; (ii) sag under the animals' weight; or (iii) otherwise do not protect the animals' feet or toes from injury are not adequate shelter.

(Ord. No. 4072-90)  
Sec. 6-50. - Dangerous or vicious dog determination hearing; appeal; license; notification of change in status. 
(a)  As used in this section, 
(1)  Dangerous dog means a canine or canine crossbreed which has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a person or companion animal or killed a companion animal; however, when a dog attacks or bites another dog, the attacking or biting dog shall not be deemed dangerous: 
(i)  If no serious physical injury as determined by a licensed veterinarian has occurred to the other dog as a result of the attack or bite; 
(ii)  Both dogs are owned by the same person; 
(iii)  If such attack occurs on the property of the attacking or biting dog's owner or custodian; or 
(iv)  For other good cause as determined by the court. No dog shall be found to be a dangerous dog as a result of biting, attacking or inflicting injury on another dog while engaged with an owner or custodian as part of lawful hunting or participating in an organized, lawful dog handling event. 
No dog that has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a person shall be found to be a dangerous dog if the court determines, based on the totality of the evidence before it, that the dog is not dangerous or a threat to the community. 
(2)  Vicious dog means a canine or canine crossbreed which has: 
(i)  Killed a person; 
(ii)  Inflicted serious injury to a person, including multiple bites, serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health, or serious impairment of a bodily function; or 
(iii)  Continued to exhibit the behavior which resulted in a previous finding by a court that it is a dangerous dog, provided that its owner has been given notice of that finding. 
(b)  Any animal control officer or law enforcement officer who has reason to believe that a canine or canine crossbreed within his jurisdiction is a dangerous dog or vicious dog shall apply to a magistrate for the issuance of a summons requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before a general district court at a specified time. The summons shall advise the owner of the nature of the proceeding and the matters at issue. If a law enforcement officer successfully makes an application for the issuance of a summons, he shall contact the animal control officer and inform him of the location of the dog and the relevant facts pertaining to his belief that the dog is dangerous or vicious. The animal control officer or owner shall confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. If the animal control officer determines that the owner or custodian can confine the animal in a manner that protects the public safety, he may permit the owner or custodian to confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian or harborer of the animal to produce the animal. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a dangerous dog, the court shall order the animal's owner to comply with the provisions of this section. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a vicious dog, the court shall order the animal euthanized in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2-6562 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. 
(c)  No canine or canine crossbreed shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog solely because it is a particular breed, nor is the ownership of a particular breed of canine or canine crossbreed prohibited. No animal shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person who was: 
(1)  Committing, at the time, a crime upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian; 
(2)  Committing, at the time, a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian; or 
(3)  Provoking, tormenting, or physically abusing the animal, or can be shown to have repeatedly provoked, tormented, abused, or assaulted the animal at other times. 
No police dog which was engaged in the performance of its duties as such at the time of the acts complained of shall be found to be a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. No animal which, at the time of the acts complained of, was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, or its owner or owner's property, shall be found to be a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. 
(d)  The owner of any animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall, within ten (10) days of such finding, obtain a dangerous dog registration certificate from the animal control officer for a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to other fees that may be authorized by law. The animal control officer shall also provide the owner with a uniformly designed tag which identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall affix the tag to the animal's collar and ensure that the animal wears the collar and tag at all times. All certificates obtained pursuant to this subdivision shall be renewed annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the initial certificate was obtained. 
(e)  All certificates or renewals thereof required to be obtained under this section shall only be issued to persons eighteen (18) years of age or older who present satisfactory evidence: 
(1)  Of the animal's current rabies vaccination, if applicable; 
(2)  That the animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure or is and will be confined inside the owner's residence or is and will be muzzled and confined in the owner's fenced-in yard until the proper enclosure is constructed; and 
(3)  That the owner has liability insurance coverage, to the value of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), that covers animal bites. 
In addition, owners who apply for certificates or renewals thereof under this section shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof unless they present satisfactory evidence that: 
(i)  Their residence is and will continue to be posted with clearly visible signs warning both minors and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on the property; 
(ii)  The animal has been permanently identified by means of a tattoo on the inside thigh or by electronic implantation; and 
(iii)  That the animal has been neutered or spayed. 
(f)  While on the property of its owner, an animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall be confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked structure designed to prevent its escape or direct contact with or entry by minors, adults, or other animals. The structure shall be designed to provide the animal with shelter from the elements of nature. When off its owner's property, an animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall be under the direct supervision by an adult eighteen (18) years of age or older and kept on a leash and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the animal or interfere with the animal's vision or respiration, but so as to prevent it from biting a person or another animal. 
(g)  If the owner of an animal, found by a court to be a dangerous dog, is a minor, the custodial parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for complying with all requirements of this section. 
(h)  After an animal has been found by a court to be a dangerous dog, the animal's owner shall immediately, upon learning of same, notify the animal control officer if the animal: 
(1)  Is loose or unconfined; 
(2)  Bites a person or attacks another animal; 
(3)  Is sold, given away, or dies; or 
(4)  Has been moved to a different address. 
(i)  The owner of any animal, which has been found by a court to be a dangerous dog, who willfully fails to comply with the requirements of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(j)  All fees collected pursuant to this section, less the costs incurred by the city in producing and distributing the certificates and tags required by this section, shall be paid into a special dedicated fund for the purpose of paying the expenses of any training course required under Section 3.2-6557 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.

Sec. 6-73. - Seizure and impoundment of animals. 
(a)  Any law enforcement officer or animal control officer may lawfully seize and impound any animal that has been abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or is suffering from an apparent violation of this chapter that has rendered the animal in such a condition as to constitute a direct and immediate threat to its life, safety or health. Before seizing or impounding any agricultural animal, such humane investigator, law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall contact the state veterinarian or a state veterinarian's representative, who shall recommend to such person the most appropriate action for the disposition of the agricultural animal. The law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall notify the owner of the agricultural animal and the local attorney of the recommendation. The law enforcement officer or animal control officer may impound the agricultural animal on the land where the agricultural animal is located if: 
(1)  The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural animal is located gives written permission; 
(2)  A general district court so orders; or 
(3)  The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural animal is located cannot be immediately located, and it is in the best interest of the agricultural animal to be impounded on the land where it is located until the written permission of the owner or tenant of the land can be obtained. 
If there is a direct and immediate threat to an agricultural animal, the law enforcement officer or animal control officer may seize the animal, in which case the humane investigator, law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall file within five (5) business days on a form approved by the state veterinarian a report on the condition of the animal at the time of the seizure, the disposition of the animal, any other information required by the state veterinarian. 
Upon seizing or impounding an animal, the humane investigator, law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall petition the general district court in the city or county where the animal is seized for a hearing. The hearing shall be not more than ten (10) business days from the date of the seizure of the animal. The hearing shall be to determine whether the animal has been abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or has not been provided adequate care. 
(b)  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall cause to be served upon the person with a right of property in the animal or the custodian of the animal notice of the hearing. If such person or the custodian is known and residing within the jurisdiction wherein the animal is seized, written notice shall be given at least five (5) days prior to the hearing of the time and place of the hearing. If such person or the custodian is known but residing out of the jurisdiction where such animal is seized, written notice by any method or service of process as is provided by the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, shall be given. If such person or the custodian is not known, the humane investigator, the law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall cause to be published in a newspaper in general circulation in the jurisdiction wherein such animal is seized notice of the hearing at least one time prior to the hearing and shall further cause notice of the hearing to be posed at least five (5) days prior to the hearing at the place provided for public notices at the city hall or courthouse wherein such hearing shall be held. 
(c)  The procedure for appeal and trial shall be the same as provided by law for misdemeanors. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Article 4, (§ 19.2-260 et seq.) of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. The Commonwealth shall be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
(d)  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall provide for such animal until the court has concluded the hearing. The owner of any animal held pursuant to this subsection for more than thirty (30) days shall post a bond in surety for the amount of the cost of boarding the animal for nine (9) months. The bond shall be forfeited if the owner is found to be not guilty of the violation. 
If the court determines that the animal has been neither abandoned, cruelly treated, nor deprived of adequate care, the animal shall be returned to the owner. If the court determines that the animal has been: 
(1)  Abandoned or cruelly treated; 
(2)  Deprived of adequate care, as that term is defined in this chapter; or 
(3)  Raised as a dog that has been, is or is intended to be used in dogfighting in violation of section 6-60, then the court shall order that the animal be: 
a.  Sold; 
b.  Humanely destroyed, or disposed of by sale or gift to a federal agency, state-supported institution, agency of the Commonwealth, agency of another state, or a licensed federal dealer having its principal place of business located with the Commonwealth; 
c.  Delivered to any local humane society or shelter, or to any person who is a resident of the city where the animal is seized or an adjacent county or city in the Commonwealth and who will pay the required license fee, if any, on such animal; or 
d.  Delivered to the person with a right of property in the animal as provided in subsection (e). 
(e)  In no case shall the owner be allowed to purchase, adopt, or otherwise obtain the animal if the court determines that the animal has been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. The court shall direct that the animal be delivered to the person with a right of property in the animal, upon his request, if the court finds that the abandonment, cruel treatment or deprivation of adequate care is not attributable to the action or inactions of such person. 
(f)  The court shall order the owner of any animal determined to have been abandoned, cruelly treated or deprived of adequate care to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such animal from the time the animal is seized until such time that the animal is disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this section, to the provider of such care. 
(g)  The court may prohibit the possession or ownership of other companion animals by the owner of any companion animal found to have been abandoned, cruelly treated or deprived of adequate care In making a determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of companion animals, the court may take into consideration the owner's past record of convictions under this chapter and other laws prohibiting cruelty to animals or pertaining to the care and treatment of animals and the owner's mental and physical condition. 
(h)  If the court finds that an agricultural animal has been abandoned or cruelly treated, the court may prohibit the possession or ownership of any other agricultural animal by the owner of the agricultural animal if the owner has exhibited a pattern of abandoning or cruelly treating agricultural animals as evidenced by previous convictions. In making a determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of agricultural animals, the court may take into consideration the owner's mental and physical condition. 
(i)  Any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing animals pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) may petition the court to repeal the prohibition after two (2) years have elapsed from the date of entry of the court's order. The court may, in its discretion, repeal the prohibition if the person can prove to the satisfaction of the court that the cause for the prohibition has ceased to exist. 
(j)  When a sale occurs, the proceeds shall first be applied to the costs of the sale then next to the unreimbursed expenses for the care and provision of the animal, and the remaining proceeds, if any, shall be paid over to the owner of the animal. 
(k)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the humane destruction of a critically injured or ill animal for humane purposes by the impounding humane investigator, law enforcement officer, animal control officer or licensed veterinarian. 
(l)  In all cases the owner may, upon proof of ownership, redeem the animal within five (5) days after such seizure upon payment of the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the first twenty-four (24) hours or portion thereof and the sum of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each succeeding day or fraction thereof; provided, however, that the minimum payment shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00). For each subsequent impoundment, within a twelve-month period, the owner may redeem the animal within five (5) days of seizure upon payment of the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first twenty-four (24) hours or portion thereof and the sum of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each succeeding day or fraction thereof; provided, however, that the minimum payment in such cases shall be fifty dollars ($50.00).

ARTICLE XII. - IDENTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF RENTAL DWELLING UNITS  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 13-191. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Conditions which immediately affect safe, decent and sanitary living conditions of persons occupying a residential rental dwelling unit include items that violate fire safety; lack of or poor condition of sanitary facilities; absence of adequate heating systems or equipment; items which affect the safe operation of electrical and mechanical systems; items which affect structural integrity of the building and/or the ability of the building envelope to keep out weather, or one (1) or more other conditions that if not corrected would be reasonably expected to become conditions that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions of the occupants. 
Disqualifying violation includes those conditions which affect safe, decent and sanitary living conditions of persons occupying a residential rental dwelling unit, or other conditions that violate the provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, or multiple building code violations that indicate in their totality that the dwelling unit is not being properly maintained. 
Dwelling unit means a building or structure or part thereof that is used for a home or residence by one (1) or more persons who maintain a household. 
Multiple-family complex means any structure, consisting of ten (10) or more dwelling units under common ownership and occupied for valuable consideration.

(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
DIVISION 2. - RENTAL INSPECTION DISTRICTS 
 
Sec. 13-192. - Factors for establishing rental inspection districts. 
After holding a duly advertised public hearing as required by Code of Virginia, § 36-105.1:1.C.1., city council finds that within the inspection districts described in section 13-193 herein below: 
(1)  There is a need to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the occupants of dwelling units inside the designated rental inspection districts; 
(2)  The residential rental dwelling units within the designated rental inspection districts are either: 
(a)  Blighted or in the process of deteriorating, or 
(b)  The residential rental dwelling units are in the need of inspection by the code compliance administrator to prevent deterioration, taking into account the number, age and condition of residential dwelling rental units inside said rental inspection districts, and 
(3)  The inspection of residential rental dwelling units inside the rental inspection districts is necessary to maintain safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for tenants and other residents living in the rental inspection districts. 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
Sec. 13-193. - Rental inspection districts established. 
Based upon the findings of city council as set forth in section 13-192 hereinabove, the following areas are included and hereby declared to be rental inspection districts (RID) which are subject to the requirements of this article. 
District 1: RID #1 
 
District 2: RID #2 
 
District 3: RID #3 
 
Maps showing the rental inspection districts described in this section are hereby adopted as a part of this article, and shall be available for public inspection in the codes compliance office. Said districts are hereinafter referred to collectively as "rental inspection districts" or "inspection districts". 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
Sec. 13-194. - Applicability. 
The provisions of this article shall apply to residential rental dwelling units located within the districts identified in section 13-193 of this article and shall further apply to certain structures located outside of such districts but meeting the requirements of section 1-6(c) herein below. 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
DIVISION 3. - INSPECTION 
 
Sec. 13-195. - Inspection and certificate required. 
(a)  The owner of each residential rental dwelling unit located in an inspection district shall obtain and permit an initial inspection and subsequent inspections of such residential rental dwelling unit as provided in this section and section 13-196. Inspections under this article shall be conducted by the department of codes compliance who is charged with the enforcement of this article. If the unit to be inspected is occupied at the time of a required inspection, it shall be the duty of the owner thereof to notify the occupants of such inspection and make the residential rental dwelling unit available for inspection. 
(b)  If inspection reveals that a residential rental dwelling unit has no disqualifying violations, the department of codes compliance shall issue a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance for such unit. However, if one (1) or more violations of the property maintenance provisions of the building code are found that do not constitute a disqualifying violation, the existence of such non-disqualifying violations shall be noted on the forty-eight-month certificate of compliance together with the date by which such non-disqualifying violations must be remedied, which date shall be determined by the department of codes compliance and which date shall be reasonable. The issuance of a certificate of compliance shall not be evidence of a lack of any and all building code violations, and shall not prevent the department of codes compliance from conducting follow-up inspections regarding building code violations in the residential rental unit, whether or not the violations affect the safe decent and sanity occupancy of said unit. If a follow-up inspection reveals that the owner has failed to remedy the noted violations by specified date, the department of codes compliance shall issue a notice of violation, revoke the forty-eight-month certificate of compliance and the unit shall thereafter be subject to annual inspections pursuant to section 13-196. 
(c)  If inspection of a residential rental dwelling unit reveals one (1) or more disqualifying violations, the department of codes compliance shall not issue a certificate of compliance until the disqualifying violations are satisfactorily remedied. However, the department of codes compliance may issue a temporary certificate of compliance if in the opinion of the department, such disqualifying violations do not constitute an immediate threat of injury to the occupants of such residential rental dwelling unit. If conditions warrant, however, the department of codes compliance may require that the residential rental dwelling unit be vacated or remain unoccupied until brought into compliance, pursuant to his authority under Code of Virginia, (1950), as amended, § 36-98, et seq., the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Upon compliance, the department of codes compliance shall, as provided in section 13-196 of this article, issue an annual certificate of compliance. 
(d)  No annual inspection pursuant to this article shall take place more than one time each year, calculated from the date of the first inspection, should additional inspections be necessary to achieve compliance. However, nothing in this article shall modify the authority of the department of codes compliance to conduct any other inspections, as allowed under the provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, and inspections for obtaining a certificate of compliance under this article do not supplant or preclude any other inspection authorized under the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. 
(e)  Unless a current certificate or temporary certificate of compliance is in force for a residential rental dwelling unit in accordance with the provisions of subsection 13-196(a)(1) of this article, and such certificate remains in effect, no owner of such unit shall permit any person to occupy such unit as a tenant or otherwise. 
(f)  A building or structure meeting the definition of a residential rental dwelling unit but located outside of an inspection district shall nevertheless be subject to the terms of this article on the following basis: City council makes a separate finding for said individual residential rental dwelling unit that: 
(1)  There is a need to protect the public health, welfare and safety of the occupants of that individual residential rental dwelling unit; 
(2)  The individual residential rental dwelling unit is either: 
a.  Blighted, or 
b.  In the process of deteriorating; or 
(3)  There is evidence of violations of the building code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for occupants of such individual residential rental dwelling unit. 
Upon said finding by the city council, said residential rental dwelling unit shall be subject to this article, notwithstanding its location outside the inspection districts. 
(g)  Should the owner fail to timely contact the code compliance office within the required time in order to schedule any inspection required under this article, or should such owner fail to allow such inspection to proceed on the date for which it was scheduled, the owner shall be in violation of this article and shall be subject to such penalties and enforcement remedies as provided in section 13-196 herein below. 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
Sec. 13-196. - Certificates of compliance; applications and exemptions. 
(a)  The following shall apply to all residential rental dwelling units located within inspection districts, which are not exempted under subsection 13-196(b). 
(1)  The initial inspection of each residential rental dwelling unit which is subject to inspection under this article, shall take place no later than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date that the owner thereof contacts the code compliance office to schedule such inspection. Each residential rental unit for which a certificate of compliance or forty-eight-month certificate of compliance as described in (a)(3) below has been issued shall be again inspected within thirty (30) days from the expiration of the certificate or expiration or earlier revocation of a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance. 
Prior to expiration of the certificate of compliance or forty-eight-month certificate of compliance, or upon earlier revocation of a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance, the owner of the residential rental dwelling unit covered thereby shall contact the code compliance office and arrange for an inspection of such unit. Except in the case of an inspection following revocation of a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance, should the date scheduled for inspection be after expiration of the current certificate and more than thirty (30) days from the day on which the owner contacted the code enforcement office to schedule inspection, a thirty-day temporary certificate of compliance shall be issued. Said inspection shall take place no later than thirty (30) days from the date of application for said inspection, and such temporary certificate shall expire on the date of the inspection. 
As to building code violations which do not immediately affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for persons living in such unit, and provided that all inspection fees shall have been remitted in advance to the issuance of such temporary certificate of compliance the department of codes compliance shall issue one (1) temporary certificate of compliance, valid for thirty (30) days and may permit such extensions thereof, as the department shall deem reasonably necessary to allow for remediation of the violations. However as to building code violations which are disqualifying violations and which violations which pose an immediate threat to the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for persons living in such unit, then the department of codes compliance shall not issue a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
Temporary certificates of compliance shall expire upon the earlier of their stated expiration date or the completion of an inspection which finds all violations satisfactorily remedied. 
(2)  Unless a residential rental unit in an inspection district is exempted from inspection under this article, or receives a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance as provided section (a) below, the term of a certificate of compliance issued for any residential rental dwelling unit in an inspection district, shall be for a term of twelve (12) months beginning with the first day of the month next following the month of issuance. 
(3)  A residential rental dwelling unit which upon inspection under this article reveals no disqualifying violations, or with only one (1) or more violations of such code that do not affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for persons living in such unit, shall not be subject to further annual inspection under this article for forty-eight (48) months from date of such annual inspection, except as provided in section 13-195, and a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance shall be issued for such unit. However, if a residential rental dwelling unit covered by a forty-eight-month certificate of compliance is found in violation of the Uniform Statewide Building Code during the term of such forty-eight-month certificate of compliance, the department of codes compliance may revoke such forty-eight-month certificate of compliance and such unit shall thereupon become subject to annual inspections and the issuance of annual certificates of compliance. If an annual certificate of compliance is issued after the inspection necessitated by the violation of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code and revocation of the extended certificate of compliance, then said residential rental dwelling unit shall again be eligible for an extended certificate of compliance only after the annual certificate of compliance has expired and as of the first subsequent annual inspection when no disqualifying violations are found. 
(4)  Should a residential rental dwelling unit be sold, or the title thereto be otherwise transferred to another owner during term of a certificate of compliance or forty-eight-month certificate of compliance issued for such unit, the term of such certificate shall end as of the last day of the month next following the month of transfer of ownership and the new owner shall contact the department of codes compliance and arrange for inspection of the unit; provided, however, that if the last inspection of the unit pursuant to this article occurred during the calendar year of transfer of ownership, the existing certificate shall not expire until the end of such calendar year. 
(b)  The following shall be exempt from the requirements of this article for the time periods indicated: 
(1)  No inspection of a newly constructed residential rental dwelling unit located in an inspection district shall be required within forty-eight (48) months of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for such newly constructed unit. Thereafter said unit shall in all respects become subject to the requirements of this article. 
(2)  All hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfast establishments, and other similar facilities to the extent occupied by transients shall be exempt from compliance with this article. 
(3)  All residential rental dwelling units owned by or leased by an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia or of the City of Newport News, shall be exempt from compliance with this article so long as said dwelling units are operated by such agency in carrying out its public purpose. 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
Sec. 13-197. - Multifamily complexes. 
(a)  If a multifamily complex contains more than ten (10) residential rental dwelling units, in the initial and annual inspections, the department of codes compliance shall inspect no less than two (2) units and not more than ten (10) percent of the residential rental dwelling units. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the number of residential rental dwelling units inspected, the department of codes compliance shall charge the fee authorized by this article for inspection of no more than ten (10) dwelling units. 
(c)  If the department of codes compliance determines upon inspection of the dwelling units in accordance with (a) above that there are within one (1) or more of such units or the building housing same, violations of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code that affect the safe, decent and sanitary living conditions for the tenants of such multifamily complex, the department may inspect as many dwelling units as it deems reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the building code in which case, the fee shall be based upon a charge per dwelling unit inspected, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
DIVISION 4. - CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE, INSPECTION FEES AND ENFORCEMENT 
 
Sec. 13-198. - Issuance of certificate; fees. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 13-197 above, there shall be a fifty-dollar ($50.00) inspection fee for the inspection of each dwelling unit. If repairs or corrections are deemed necessary by the department of codes compliance, and a reinspection is required, no additional fee shall be charged for the reinspection. If, however, subsequent reinspections are required, there shall be charged an additional fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per dwelling unit for each subsequent reinspection. No reinspection shall be performed, nor any certificate of compliance be issued, unless all fees have been paid. 
(b)  Requests for an inspection may be made by telephone; provided that the department of codes compliance shall, in all cases, receive notice from the owner and payment of the applicable inspection fees prior to conducting any inspection required under this article. 
(c)  The department of codes compliance shall issue a forty-eight-month certificate, as provided in section 13-196 hereinabove if, upon inspection, the department finds that the residential rental dwelling unit does not have any disqualifying violations. The forty-eight-month certificate of compliance may be issued immediately upon completion of an inspection in which no disqualifying violations are found. 
(d)  If the dwelling unit fails to comply with any one (1) or more provisions of Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, and any amendments thereto, the department of codes compliance shall furnish the owner with a written list of specific violations. Failure to list any violation shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation. Upon the completion of all corrections and repairs, the owner shall arrange a reinspection of the residential rental dwelling unit. Reinspection shall be for the purpose of determining compliance by the owner with the written list of specific violations furnished to the owner by the codes compliance administrator. However, if upon reinspection, the department of codes compliance discovers other violations that were not listed on the written list of specific violations previously furnished to the owner, the department shall furnish the owner with a supplemental list of violations and shall provide the owner a reasonable opportunity to correct same. This provision, however, shall not preclude the department from revoking the forty-eight-month certificate of compliance if the subsequently discovered violations are disqualifying violations or if the non-disqualifying violations have not been corrected pursuant to sections 13-195 and 13-196. 
(Ord. No. 7320-16)  
Sec. 13-199. - Appeals; effects.

(b)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit, impair, alter or extend the rights and remedies of persons in their relationship of landlord and tenant as such rights and remedies exist under applicable law. 
(c)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to relieve or exempt any person from otherwise complying with all applicable laws, ordinances, standards and regulations pertaining to the condition of buildings and other structures. 
(d)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the authority of the department of codes compliance to perform housing inspections in accordance with applicable law.

(See paragraph (1) below for a detailed breakdown of violations and fines.) The repetitive occurrence of a violation reflects a violation that is not an isolated occurrence, consequently the fine shall increase with each repeated offense.

(2)  Fines based on repetitive occurrence of violations. 
a.  In keeping with the city's intent to first educate before issuing penalties, the first offense of any violation shall result in a documented notification of the violation (a "field notice"). This will serve merely as a courtesy to inform the resident that a violation may have occurred and to warn the resident that a repeated violation could result in more severe administrative action. 
b.  A second offense shall result in a second field notice, again specifying the violation and noting the number of occurrences; however, no fine will be issued. 
c.  Third and subsequent offenses shall result in a citation, which would carry with it a monetary fine as indicated below: 
Occurrence* 	Action 	Dollar Amount

of Fine
1st Notice 	Warning 	None 
2nd Notice 	Warning 	None 
3rd Notice 	Citation and Fine 	Face value of violation per Article IX(b) 
4th Notice 	Citation and Fine 	Two (2) times the face value of the violation per Article IX(b) 
5th Notice 	Citation and Fine 	Three (3) times the face value of the violation per Article IX(b) 
Additional Notices 	Citation and Fine 	Three (3) times the face value of the violation per Article IX(b) 
 
*Occurrences outside the most recent forty-eight-month time period shall not be counted. If, for example, a resident has not been cited for any violation in the previous forty-eight (48) months, no citation that occurred prior to the forty-eight (48) months would be factored into determining the next type of citation. 
d.  Beginning the eighth calendar day after the date the citation was issued, charges for fines shall be assessed if the violation is not remedied and shall accumulate daily until balance is paid in full. Payment shall be made to the Solid Waste Division, Public Works Department, City of Newport News. 
(3)  Fines of a miscellaneous nature. 
a.  Eviction not called in for scheduled appointment at least three (3) working days prior to set out. Normally, a private eviction called-in in advance of the set out of debris would be due a fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00); however, a set out that was not called in for an appointment will be charged a fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00). This does not apply to Sheriff-initiated evictions, which are not assessed a fee. 
b.  Illegal dumping. This is a criminal offense and therefore not punishable as a civil fine. 
c.  Scavenging/tampering with city property. This is a criminal offence and therefore not punishable as a civil fine. 
d.  Litter. This is a criminal offense and therefore not punishable as a civil fine 
(4)  Fees for special services (e.g. excess bulk). 
a.  Excess of six (6) cubic yards of debris placed at curbside for collection. A fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be assessed for each cubic yard of debris in excess of six (6) cubic yards. For example, a resident with twelve (12) cubic yards of debris would pay one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00). This fee is in addition to the fine set forth in (b)(1)b.viii. above. 
b.  Debris, litter or rubbish placed curbside that is considered dangerous or constitutes a nuisance, and which removal is required within twenty-four (24) hours, and for which a notice has been served, and failure to comply within the specified time period, shall be charged two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per truck load or partial truck load and shall be charged to the property owner or occupant responsible for placing the material curbside. 
c.  These fines are cumulative rather than exclusive penalties, and in no way supersede any other penalties set forth in this chapter unless otherwise noted.

The common parent corporation directly owns stock possessing at least eighty (80) percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least eighty (80) percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of at least one (1) of the other includable corporations. As used in this subdivision, the term "stock" does not include nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends. The term "includable corporation" means any corporation within the affiliated group irrespective of the state or country of its incorporation; and the term "receipts" includes total gross receipts and total gross income.

Assessments shall be deemed made by the commissioner when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by the commissioner, or an employee of the commissioner, or mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed, or if no return is required, when the tax and fee are paid.

(b)  A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business and for each business operated in the city. 
(c)  A person engaged in two (2) or more businesses carried on at the same place of business may elect to obtain one (1) license for all such businesses if all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) each business is licensable at the location and has satisfied all requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of the city; (ii) all of the businesses are subject to the same tax rate, or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses at the highest rate; (iii) if the business is a motor vehicle dealer who does not elect to use the alternate method as provided in article II hereof; and (iv) the taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the nature of all businesses and their total gross receipts.

The application shall be on forms prescribed by the commissioner. Any person who engages in a business without obtaining a required license or after being refused a license, shall not be relieved of the tax and fee imposed by this chapter. 
(e)  All license taxes and fees imposed by this chapter, except as otherwise herein provided, shall be deemed to be due on the date of the beginning of the business, employment or profession. Any person prosecuting any licensable business, employment or profession on or before the 1st day of January of any year shall file the appropriate license application with the commissioner on or before the 1st day of March of such year and the license tax and fee shall be paid to the commissioner or the treasurer as designated collectors of the city's business license taxes and fees on or before the 1st day of March, except as otherwise herein provided. The commissioner is also a designated collector of business license taxes and fees, and such sums collected by the commissioner shall be deposited with the treasurer no later than the next business day after receipt by the commissioner. Any person beginning a business after the 1st day of January of any year, unless otherwise stated, shall first file with the commissioner an application for a license covering such business and the license tax and fee shall be paid to the commissioner or treasurer, as designated collectors of the city's business license taxes and fees, on or before the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of beginning business or the 1st day of March of the license year, whichever is later. 
(f)  The commissioner may grant an extension of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, in which to file an application for a license, for good cause. The extension may be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax or fee, subject to adjustment to the correct tax or fee at the end of the extension together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a penalty of ten (10) percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(g)  In addition to any fines imposed for a violation of this chapter, a penalty of ten (10) percent of the tax or fee due shall be imposed upon either the failure to file an application or the failure to pay the tax or fee by the appropriate due date, but not both unless the commissioner determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional taxes and fees made by the assessing official, if the application was made in good faith, and the understatement of the total gross receipts, tax or fee was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax or fee. Except as otherwise provided, if any assessment of a tax or fee by the assessing official is not paid within thirty (30) days, a ten-percent late payment penalty shall be imposed. If the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer, the penalty shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the assessing official. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. 
(h)  In addition to the penalty imposed by this section for the late payment of a tax or fee, interest shall be charged at the rate of eight (8) percent of the delinquent tax or fee due from the due date until the date paid, without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax or fee by the commissioner is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded by the city, together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any tax or fee paid under this chapter from the date of payment or due date of the refunded taxes, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate charged under § 58.1-3916 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. 
No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid by the city on a refund or charged on a late payment, in event of such adjustment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than thirty (30) days from: (i) the day of the payment that created the refund; or (ii) the due date of the tax and fee, whichever is later. 
(i)  The following business activities shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter to obtain a business license: 
(1)  Exemptions as provided in the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended;

Editor's note Ord. No. 6701-10 shall be in effect on and after July 1, 2010.  
Sec. 23-6. - General requirement, violation. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in business in the city for which a license tax or fee is imposed by this chapter without first, (i) making application for and obtaining such license, (ii) paying such taxes and fees as required by the provisions of this chapter, and (iii) obtaining any required decal or other evidence that the license has been issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4969-96, § 1)  
Sec. 23-7. - Situs of gross receipts. 
(a)  General rule. Whenever the tax or fee imposed by this chapter is measured by total gross receipts, the total gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those total gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within the city. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the total gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business within the city from which such activities are initiated, directed or controlled, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The situs of total gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one (1) or more definite places of business as follows: 
(1)  The total gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Section 58.1-3715 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. 
(2)  The total gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax or fee measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to a license tax or fee in two (2) or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and total gross receipts subject to license tax or fee in each locality. 
(3)  The total gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed. 
(4)  The total gross receipts from the performance of services by a business shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b)  Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one (1) definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business total gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule, and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement, the total gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to the city in the event the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax or fee on the total gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c)  Agreements. The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of Virginia concerning the manner in which total gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the total gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. In the event the commissioner is notified or becomes aware that its method of attributing total gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one (1) or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes or fees on more than one hundred (100) percent of its total gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, either the assessor or taxpayer may seek an advisory opinion from the department of taxation pursuant to Section 58.1-3701; notice of the request shall be given to the other party. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 58.1-3993, when a taxpayer has demonstrated to a court that two (2) or more political subdivisions of Virginia have assessed taxes or fees on total gross receipts that may create a double assessment within the meaning of Section 58.1-3986, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the litigation as may be necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments even though it is not then known which assessment is correct and which is erroneous. 
(Ord. No. 4969-96, § 1)  
Sec. 23-8. - Limitations and extensions. 
(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, both the commissioner of the revenue and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding § 58.1-3903 of the Code of Virginia, the commissioner of the revenue shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six (6) preceding license years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any license tax under this chapter shall not expire prior to the period specified in State Code § 58.1-3940, two (2) years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this subdivision of the ordinance, two (2) years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 23-8.1(b) or (d) of this chapter, or two (2) years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to section 40-227 or a similar law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later.

Amount in dispute when used with respect to taxes due or assessed, means the amount specifically identified in the administrative appeal or application for judicial review as disputed by the party filing such appeal or application. 
Appealable event means an increase in the assessment of the license tax payable by a taxpayer, the denial of a refund, or the assessment of a license tax where none previously was assessed, arising out of the commissioner of the revenue's (i) examination of records, financial statements, books of account, or other information for the purpose of determining the correctness of an assessment; (ii) determination regarding the rate or classification applicable to the licensable business; (iii) assessment of a license tax when no return has been filed by the taxpayer; or (iv) denial of an application for correction of erroneous assessment attendant to the filing of an amended application for license. 
Frivolous means a finding, based on specific facts, that the party asserting the appeal is unlikely to prevail upon the merits because the appeal is (i) not well grounded in fact; (ii) not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; (iii) interposed for an improper purpose, such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay in the payment of tax or a refund, or to create needless cost from the litigation; or (iv) otherwise frivolous. 
Jeopardize by delay means a finding, based on specific facts, that a taxpayer desires to (i) depart quickly from the locality; (ii) remove his property therefrom; (iii) conceal himself or his property; or (iv) do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
Tax commissioner means the Chief Executive Officer of the Virginia Department of Taxation, or his delegate. 
(b)  Filing and contents of administrative appeal. Any person assessed with a license tax under this chapter as a result of an appealable event as defined in this section may file an administrative appeal of the assessment within one (1) year from the last day of the tax year for which such assessment is made, or within one (1) year from the date of the appealable event, whichever is later, with the commissioner of the revenue. The appeal must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, the tax periods covered by the challenged assessments, the amount in dispute, the remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The commissioner of the revenue may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, an audit or further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the appeal. The assessment placed at issue in the appeal shall be deemed prima facie correct. The commissioner of the revenue shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a written determination to the taxpayer setting forth the facts and arguments in support of his decision. 
(c)  Notice of right of appeal and procedures. Every assessment made by a commissioner of the revenue pursuant to an appealable event shall include or be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to file an administrative appeal and the specific procedures to be followed (the name and address to which the appeal should be directed), an explanation of the required content of the appeal, and the deadline for filing the appeal. 
(d)  Suspension of collection activity during appeal. Provided a timely and complete administrative appeal is filed, collection activity with respect to the amount in dispute shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the commissioner of the revenue, unless the treasurer or other official responsible for the collection of such tax (i) determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay as defined in this section; (ii) is advised by the commissioner of the revenue that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time; or (iii) is advised by the commissioner of the revenue that the appeal is frivolous as defined in this section. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 23-5(h), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended.

The tax commissioner shall not consider an appeal filed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection if he finds that the absence of a final determination on the part of the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official was caused by the willful failure or refusal of the taxpayer to provide information requested and reasonably needed by the commissioner or other assessing official to make his determination. 
(Ord. No. 6253-06, § 1)  
Sec. 23-8.2. - Administrative appeal to the tax commissioner. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a license tax under this chapter as a result of a determination, upon an administrative appeal to the commissioner of the revenue pursuant to section 23-8.1, that is adverse to the position asserted by the taxpayer in such appeal may appeal such assessment to the tax commissioner within ninety (90) days of the date of the determination by the commissioner of the revenue. The appeal shall be in such form as the tax commissioner may prescribe and the taxpayer shall serve a copy of the appeal upon the commissioner of the revenue. The tax commissioner shall permit the commissioner of the revenue to participate in the proceedings, and shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within ninety (90) days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the commissioner of the revenue are notified that a longer period will be required. The appeal shall proceed in the same manner as an application pursuant to § 58.1-1821, of the Code of Virginia, and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to § 58.1-1822 of the State Code. 
(b)  Suspension of collection activity during appeal. On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subdivision (a) of this section, collection activity with respect to the amount in dispute shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner, unless the treasurer or other official responsible for the collection of such tax (i) determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay as defined in this section; (ii) is advised by the commissioner of the revenue, or the tax commissioner, that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time; or (iii) is advised by the commissioner of the revenue that the appeal is frivolous as defined in this section. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 23-5(h), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The requirement that collection activity be suspended shall cease unless an appeal pursuant to this section is filed and served on the necessary parties within thirty (30) days of the service of notice of intent to file such appeal. 
(c)  Implementation of determination of tax commissioner. Promptly upon receipt of the final determination of the tax commissioner with respect to an appeal pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, the commissioner of the revenue shall take those steps necessary to calculate the amount of tax owed by or refund due to the taxpayer consistent with the tax commissioner's determination and shall provide that information to the taxpayer and to the treasurer or other official responsible for collection in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. 
(1)  If the determination of the tax commissioner sets forth a specific amount of tax due, the commissioner of the revenue shall certify the amount to the treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and the treasurer or other official responsible for collection shall issue a bill to the taxpayer for such amount due, together with interest accrued and penalty, if any is authorized by this chapter, within thirty (30) days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner. 
(2)  If the determination of the tax commissioner sets forth a specific amount of refund due, the commissioner of the revenue shall certify the amount to the treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and the treasurer or other official responsible for collection shall issue a payment to the taxpayer for such amount due, together with interest accrued pursuant to this section, within thirty (30) days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner. 
(3)  If the determination of the tax commissioner does not set forth a specific amount of tax due, or otherwise requires the commissioner of the revenue to undertake a new or revised assessment that will result in an obligation to pay a tax that has not previously been paid in full, the commissioner of the revenue shall promptly commence the steps necessary to undertake such new or revised assessment, and provide the same to the taxpayer within sixty (60) days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner, or within sixty (60) days after receipt from the taxpayer of any additional information requested or reasonably required under the determination of the tax commissioner, whichever is later. The commissioner of the revenue shall certify the new assessment to the treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and the treasurer or other official responsible for collection shall issue a bill to the taxpayer for the amount due, together with interest accrued and penalty, if any is authorized by this chapter, within thirty (30) days of the date of the new assessment. 
(4)  If the determination of the tax commissioner does not set forth a specific amount of refund due, or otherwise requires the commissioner of the revenue to undertake a new or revised assessment that will result in an obligation on the part of the locality to make a refund of taxes previously paid, the commissioner of the revenue shall promptly commence the steps necessary to undertake such new or revised assessment, and provide the same to the taxpayer within sixty (60) days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner, or within sixty (60) days after receipt from the taxpayer of any additional information requested or reasonably required under the determination of the tax commissioner, whichever is later. The commissioner of the revenue shall certify the new assessment to the treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and the treasurer or other official responsible for collection shall issue a refund to the taxpayer for the amount of tax due, together with interest accrued, within thirty (30) days of the date of the new assessment. 
(Ord. No. 6253-06, § 1)  
Sec. 23-8.3. - Judicial review of determination of tax commissioner. 
(a)  Judicial review. Following the issuance of a final determination of the tax commissioner pursuant to section 23-8.2, the taxpayer or commissioner of the revenue may apply to the circuit court for judicial review of the determination, or any part thereof, pursuant to section 40-227. In any such proceeding for judicial review of a determination of the tax commissioner, the burden shall be on the party challenging the determination of the tax commissioner, or any part thereof, to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous with respect to the part challenged. Neither the tax commissioner nor the Virginia Department of Taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(b)  Suspension of payment of disputed amount of tax due upon taxpayer's notice of intent to initiate judicial review. 
(1)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an application for judicial review, pursuant to section 40-227, of a determination of the tax commissioner pursuant to section 23-8.2, and upon payment of the amount of the tax that is not in dispute together with any penalty and interest then due with respect to such undisputed portion of the tax, the treasurer or other collection official shall further suspend collection activity while the court retains jurisdiction unless the court, upon appropriate motion after notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that (i) the taxpayer's application for judicial review is frivolous, as defined in this section; (ii) collection would be jeopardized by delay, as defined in this section; or (iii) suspension of collection would cause substantial economic hardship to the city. For purposes of determining whether substantial economic hardship to the city would arise from a suspension of collection activity, the court shall consider the cumulative effect of then-pending appeals filed within the locality by different taxpayers that allege common claims or theories of relief. 
(2)  Upon a determination that the appeal is frivolous, that collection may be jeopardized by delay, or that suspension of collection would result in substantial economic hardship to the locality, the court may require the taxpayer to pay the amount in dispute or a portion thereof, or to provide surety for payment of the amount in dispute in a form acceptable to the court. 
(3)  No suspension of collection activity shall be required if the application for judicial review fails to identify with particularity the amount in dispute.

(7)  Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution for which no consideration is received, and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory, whether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. 
(8)  Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a licensable business not classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the licensed privilege.

State Law reference Authority for above section, Code of Virginia, § 46.2-935.  
Sec. 26-215. - Interference with traffic prohibited. 
(a)  Intent of section. The intent of this section is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and visitors of the city and to enable the free, orderly, and uninterrupted movement of motor vehicles on public roadways within the city by limiting interactions between pedestrians and motor vehicles located within the traffic or travel lane of highways or public roadways located within the city. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  "Roadway" includes all public roads, streets, and highways open to vehicular traffic within the city. This definition excludes private roads, private property, and public parking areas. 
(2)  "Motor vehicle" means every self-propelled or designed for self-propulsion device by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn on a highway, except devices moved by human power. 
(c)  Findings. The city council hereby finds the following: 
(1)  Allowing transactions in which items are exchanged between pedestrians and occupants of motor vehicles operating in the traffic or travel lane of roadways is inherently dangerous, is distracting to both pedestrians and drivers of motor vehicles, threatens the safety and well-being of the pedestrians and motor vehicle occupants, interferes with the free flow of traffic, and potentially threatens the safety and well-being of nearby third parties; 
(2)  The traffic or travel lane of roadways in which motor vehicles are present and operating is not designed for and is not an appropriate location for anything other than travel; 
(3)  The prohibition against interfering with traffic as set forth herein is narrowly tailored to serve the city's substantial interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of citizens and visitors of the city; and 
(4)  This prohibition leaves open many alternative channels for interactions which do not disrupt traffic flows or create a danger to those present on roadways. 
(d)  Prohibition. It shall be unlawful for: 
(1)  A pedestrian to exchange or attempt to exchange any item with the occupant of a motor vehicle while the motor vehicle is located in a traffic or travel lane of any roadway. 
(2)  The occupant of any motor vehicle to exchange or attempt to exchange any item with a pedestrian while the motor vehicle is located in a traffic or travel lane of any roadway. 
(e)  Exceptions. This section shall not apply to the following: 
(1)  The distribution, receipt, or exchange of any item with the occupant of a motor vehicle parked on private property or parked in a public parking area. 
(2)  Any law enforcement officer acting within the scope of his or her official duties. 
(3)  The distribution, receipt, or exchange of any item with the occupant of a motor vehicle located in the roadway after a motor vehicle accident, or to assist the occupant of a disabled motor vehicle, or to assist a pedestrian or motor vehicle occupant experiencing a medical emergency. 
(f)  Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a traffic infraction.

ARTICLE IX. - RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM 
 
Sec. 26-221. - Residential permit parking. 
(a)  Pursuant to the provisions of this article, and in addition to those streets designated in section 26-226, the city manager or his designee is authorized to designate streets within residential areas in the city on which parking may be authorized beyond the posted restricted period. This program shall be known as the residential permit parking program ("RPPP").

(Ord. No. 2855-81; Ord. No. 4015-90; Ord. No. 6550-08, § 1)  
Sec. 26-222. - Eligibility requirements. 
(a)  In addition to those areas designated in section 26-226, a block on a street within a residential area shall be deemed eligible for residential permit parking in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  A petition requesting inclusion in the residential parking permit program, and signed by authorized representatives of at least seventy-five (75) percent of the households in the one-block area must be received by the city manager. 
(2)  A parking survey shall be conducted of the petitioning block, the results of which must indicate that vehicles occupy at least seventy-five (75) percent of the curb faces or road shoulder during peak parking periods and at least twenty-five (25) percent of such vehicles are owned by persons not residing on the block. 
(3)  In the event that such criteria are met, the city manager shall designate the eligible block or blocks as being within a residential parking permit program area. 
(b)  Following the designation of a residential parking permit (hereinafter referred to as "permit") area by ordinance or by the procedure outlined in this article, the director of engineering, or his designee, shall issue appropriate parking permits and shall cause parking signs to be erected in program areas indicating conditions under which parking shall be permitted. A permit shall be issued upon application, and payment of the application fee, only to a motor vehicle owner who resides or owns a business on property immediately adjacent to a street, avenue or other location within the residential parking permit area, and for only such vehicles as are normally garaged at said residence or business. One (1) permit shall be issued for each vehicle licensed at that address or each person who is a licensed driver residing at that address, whichever is less, up to a total of three (3) permits. If the resident is in possession of a vehicle registered to his or her employer and provided for the use of the resident by the owner, a permit shall be issued for that vehicle as well. Where the owner of a building within a residential parking area is a non-resident landlord or when a non-resident uses or leases the building for commercial purposes, only one (1) permit shall be issued to the non-resident owner. Applicants for permits will be required to present their vehicle registration, driver's license, required fees, and proof of residence acceptable under the procedures for residential parking permit program along with the application. Other information may be required as deemed necessary by the director of engineering, or his designee, in order to guarantee proper issuance of the permit. 
(c)  The operator of a vehicle displaying a valid residential parking permit may park a motor vehicle operated by him on the street on which the residence is located within the designated residential parking area during such time as the parking of motor vehicles therein is permitted. While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked, such permit shall be displayed in a manner designated by the director of engineering, or his designee, so as to be clearly visible. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder a parking space within a designated residential parking permit area. 
(d)  Any request for variance in the total number of permits will be subject to determination by the director of engineering, or his designee, in accordance with the procedures for issuing residential parking permit program (RPPP) permits prepared by the department of engineering, as approved by city council.

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to use or display or allow to be used or displayed a residential parking permit issued hereunder upon any vehicle other than the vehicle for which such permit was issued. 
(b)  It shall constitute a violation of this regulation for any person to falsely represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to furnish any false information in an application to the director of engineering or his designee in order to obtain a residential parking permit. 
(c)  In any prosecution charging that a vehicle has been parked in violation of any provision of this article, proof that the vehicle described in the complaint, summons or warrant was parked in violation of any such provision, together with proof that the defendant was, at the time of such violation, the registered owner of the vehicle, as required by Title 46.2 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that such registered owner of the vehicle was the person who parked the vehicle at the place where, and for the time during which, such violation occurred.

The concern over sexually-transmitted diseases, and the deleterious effect on both existing businesses and surrounding neighborhoods caused by increased crime and the downgrading of property values, demands reasonable regulation of live exhibitions or performances in business establishments which provide such exhibitions or performances in any viewing areas, private or semi-private rooms, booths, or cubicles within business establishments in order to (i) protect the health, safety and welfare of the city's citizens and visitors; (ii) protect citizens and visitors from increased crime; and (iii) preserve the quality of life, property values, the character of surrounding neighborhoods, and the city's tourism industry and other economic interests. 
The intent of this section is not to suppress any activities protected by the First Amendment, but is to enact content-neutral regulations which are specifically designed and intended to prevent the deleterious secondary effects associated with live exhibitions or performances in business establishments which provide such exhibitions or performances in private or semi-private rooms, booths, viewing areas or cubicles. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any person to maintain or operate for himself or herself, or as an officer, employee or agent, a business establishment where live exhibitions or performances take place, unless the following requirements have been met.

Sec. 28-4. - Curfew for certain minors. 
(a)  Intent. Council enacts this section prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community standards, regulations for the conduct of minors in public places at night, for the good of minors, for the support and furtherance of the institution of the family, and for the general public good, safety and welfare. Council does not intend hereby to prohibit or interfere with any lawful activity. Council intends hereby to ensure that minors in public places at night after curfew are provided with responsible adult supervision, and to promote and enhance parental control over minors. 
(b)  Factfinding. Council finds that the curfew for certain minors section has been a significant factor in deterring juvenile delinquency in the past, and that it should now be updated and amplified in compliance with changes in the law and in response to increases in drug related crime and crime in general within the city. Council further finds that Newport News' stability as a community is based on the institution of the family; that parental responsibility for the whereabouts of their children is the norm; and that legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility, because they encourage parental responsibility, decrease juvenile delinquency. Council further finds that youths at night are more vulnerable to crime and peer pressure than adults; that minors lack experience, perspective and judgment to recognize and avoid detrimental choices such as drugs, alcohol and crime; and that the city's restriction on minors' movement after 10:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after 11:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday reinforces parental authority and home life, and encourages parents to actively supervise their children. 
Council is aware that proceedings before a Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court pursuant to this section constitute status offenses governed by Code of Virginia, 1950, Section 16.1-278.6, as amended. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words, as used in this section, shall mean the following: 
(1)  The word "officer" shall mean a member of the Newport News Police Department or any other law enforcement officer. 
(2)  The word "guardian" shall mean a legal guardian or other adult person having care, custody or control of a minor. 
(3)  The word "minor" shall mean a person less than eighteen (18) years of age. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful for any minor to be present on any street, road, alley, avenue, park or other public place in the city, or in any vehicle operating or parked thereon, between the hours of 10:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, and 5:00 a.m. of the following day, unless accompanied by his/her parent or guardian or unless such minor is on an emergency errand or legitimate business directed by his parent or guardian or is engaged in a lawful employment or going directly to the place of such employment or returning directly to his place of residence from the place of such employment. 
(e)  It shall be unlawful for any minor to be present on any street, road, alley, avenue, park or other public place in the city, or in any vehicle operating or parked thereon, between the hours of 11:00 p.m. on Friday or Saturday and 5:00 a.m. of the following day, unless accompanied by his/her parent or guardian or unless such minor is on an emergency errand or legitimate business directed by his parent or guardian or is engaged in a lawful employment or going directly to the place of such employment or returning directly to his place of residence from the place of such employment. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian of any minor to permit, allow or encourage such minor to be present on any street, road, alley, avenue, park or other public place in the city, or in any vehicle operating or parked thereon, in violation of provisions of subsections (d) or (e) of this section. 
(g)  Exceptions. In the following cases, a minor in or upon a public place under the circumstances prohibited by subsections (d) and (e), shall not be in violation of this section: 
(1)  When a minor is in a motor vehicle engaged in interstate travel. This is intended, from excess of caution, to exempt from regulation bona fide interstate travel through, beginning or ending, in the city. 
(2)  When the minor was attending an activity on the property of or sponsored by a city or state agency or body, or a school or a religious organization, or was returning to the minor's place of residence therefrom, without detour or stop. 
(3)  When a minor is a volunteer firefighter or volunteer rescue squad member and is responding to emergency calls in that capacity. 
(4)  When the minor is attending a specified engagement or performance, or participating in any assembly or expressive activity protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; provided that the minor shall have in his possession written permission including the signature, address and telephone number, of a parent, guardian or other adult person having care, custody or control of such minor to attend such activity or event, and shall return directly to his residence upon conclusion thereof. 
(5)  When the minor has exited an arena, performance hall, theater, baseball stadium, ball, or like destination for entertainment or spectator sports, and the minor can present substantiating evidence of having been to such a venue and can demonstrate that the minor is taking the most direct route to a motor vehicle or designated retrieval space that is not on a sidewalk or street. 
(h)  Any minor taken into custody for a violation of this section, shall be processed as follows: 
(1)  So long as funds are appropriated therefor, the officer shall transport the minor to the city's facility designated as a juvenile curfew reception center. The officer will contact the on-call intake officer to facilitate placement of the minor for protective custody if the parent cannot be reached within a reasonable time but prior to the facility closing. In the event the minor is released to the parent or guardian, it shall be evidenced by the parent's signature on the Juvenile History Sheet utilized by the Newport News Police Department. An explanation of the reason for the detention shall be given to the parent or guardian. A record of this event containing a brief description of the circumstances shall be kept on file by the Newport News Police Department. 
(2)  Should any such minor refuse to give such officer his/her name and address or the name, address and telephone number of his/her parent or guardian or in the event no parent or guardian can be located, or if located is unable to accept custody of such minor, such officer shall take such minor to the intake division of the juvenile and domestic relations district court of the city to be dealt with in the manner required by law. 
(i)  Any person who is found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this section, or who shall knowingly give a false name, address or telephone number to such officer, shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. In addition, any minor found guilty of violating this section may be subject to any order of disposition authorized by Code of Virginia, 1950, Sections 16.1-278.4 and 16.1-278.5, as amended. 
(j)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any minor who has been emancipated. 
(k)  Severability. Severability is intended throughout and within this section. If any provision (including inter alia any exception, part, phrases or term), is for any reason held invalid, or its application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, then the remainder of this section shall continue in full force and effect, and its application to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected.

DIVISION 4. - CREDITED SERVICE 
 
Sec. 31-35. - Credited service for work performed for a participating employer. 
(a)  Each member shall receive credited service as set out in this division. 
(b)  For each member of the fund on January 1, 1983, the credited service of such member as an employee prior to July 1, 1977, shall be equal to the credited service of such member with respect to such service as was determined as of December 31, 1982, in accordance with the provisions of the fund in effect on December 31, 1982. The amount of such credited service for each member shall be conclusively determined as of December 31, 1982 and shall not be subject to adjustment after January 1, 1983, except to the extent necessary to correct a mistake of fact or clerical error. 
(c)  On and after July 1, 1977, each member shall receive credited service for each month of service rendered to a participating employer while in a regular full-time or equivalent position as defined by the administrative policies of the city. 
(d)  Credited service shall be measured in years, with each month of credited service in excess of complete years being considered as one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of a year. 
(1)  In computing the credited service of any member, other than a school board employee member, fifteen (15) days or more of service during any month (fourteen (14) days or more of service during the month of February) shall constitute a month of service and twelve (12) months of service shall constitute a year. 
(2)  In computing the credited service of any school board employee member, the school employment year, be it ten (10), eleven (11), or twelve (12) months, shall constitute a year of service, so long as the employee completes the employment year; otherwise fifteen (15) days or more of service during any month (fourteen (14) days or more of service during the month of February) shall constitute a month of service and twelve (12) months of service shall constitute a year. 
(e)  Any accumulated unused paid medical leave shall be credited as additional credited service for benefits computation unless forfeited pursuant to section 2-123. Effective July 1, 2008, one (1) month of service shall be credited for each one hundred sixty (160) hours (three hundred forty-two (342) hours for firefighters assigned to twenty-four-hour shifts) of accumulated paid medical leave. 
In no event shall credited service for unused paid medical leave be granted to a member who is an employee of the school board and receives payment in consideration of accumulated unused paid medical leave. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the credited service provisions set forth in the other subsections of this section, credited service for persons appointed by the city council to offices of the city shall be established as follows: 
(1)  For each of the first two (2) years of appointed service, the appointees shall be entitled to two point five (2.5) years of credited service. 
(2)  For each year after the first two (2) years of appointed service, appointees shall be entitled to one (1) year of credited service. 
This subsection shall apply to those persons appointed by city council to offices of the city who were not vested on December 13, 1988, and to all subsequent appointees to such offices. 
(g)  Effective July 1, 2003, any member who is eligible to retire under section 31-52 or section 31-53 of this Code may, at their option immediately prior to their retirement date, exchange up to six hundred forty (640) hours of paid personal leave (eight hundred sixty-four hours (864) for firefighters assigned to a twenty-four-hour shifts) for credited service at the then current, cost-neutral exchange rates established by the board's actuary. This exchange of paid personal leave for credited service may not be used in meeting the eligibility requirements of section 31-52 or section 31-53. 
(h)  In lieu of or in addition to leave exchange under subsection (g), any member who is eligible to retire under section 31-52 or section 31-53 of this Code may elect to purchase credited service immediately prior to their retirement date, in any amount up to the value of paid personal leave referenced in subsection (g) by means of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer from a city approved 457(b) deferred compensation plan (other than the plan provided for in section 2-106). A participant electing such a trustee-to-trustee transfer must contribute the value of paid personal leave that will be subject to the trustee-to-trustee transfer into the participant's account under the 457 plan, up to the maximum contribution allowed under the terms of the 457 plan with respect to the 457 plan year. If a participant has already contributed the maximum permissible amount to the 457 plan with respect to that 457 plan year, or if the contribution of paid personal leave causes the participant to reach the maximum contribution limit under the 457 plan, then amounts previously credited to the participant's account under the 457 plan may be included in the trustee-to-trustee transfer to the extent necessary to purchase the amount of service credit elected by the participant. 
Credited service purchased under this subsection (h) shall be determined according to the same actuarial factors that are applied for purposes of subsection (g). The total combined amount of credited service purchased by any member under subsection (g) and subsection (h) shall not exceed the maximum amount of service credit that would be allowed to be purchased under subsection (g). This purchase of credited service may not be used in meeting the eligibility requirements of section 31-52 or section 31-53. If and only if retroactive adoption of this ordinance is approved by the Internal Revenue Service in response to a voluntary compliance submission or similar ruling request, this subsection (h) shall become effective as of July 1, 2003 or such other date as is specified by the Internal Revenue Service. 
(i)  Effective for limitation years beginning on and after July 1, 1998, any provision of this article to the contrary notwithstanding and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, pursuant to the provisions of IRC section 415(n)(3), if a vested member elects to exchange paid personal leave for credited service under this section 31-35 of the fund, such exchange, combined with any prior paid personal leave exchanges shall be limited to five (5) years of credited service to the extent such credited service constitutes "nonqualified service credit," as defined in IRC section 415(n)(3)(C). The foregoing language shall not apply to employer contributions not subject to a member's election. In the case of an eligible participant as defined in Section 1526(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1997, the foregoing limitations shall not be applied to reduce the amount of permissive service credit which may be purchased to an amount less than the amount which was allowed to be purchased under the terms of this plan as in effect on August 5, 1997.

The length of the elapsed period shall be measured in accordance with the provisions of section 31-35. However, no credited service shall be reinstated if the date of reemployment occurred on or after March 1, 2010 (or July 1, 2009 for reemployment by the school board). 
(b)  In the event the period of credited service that was forfeited at the last termination of employment is less than the elapsed period since the most recent date of termination of employment, such credited service shall not be subject to reinstatement in the event of the subsequent reemployment of the former member.

Sec. 31-38. - Reemployment of a vested, terminated member not receiving retirement benefits. 
Upon reemployment by a participating employer of a vested terminated member not receiving retirement benefits into a position that accrues credited service in the fund, the retirement allowance calculation for the vested terminated employment period shall be calculated using the provisions in effect at the time of termination of the vested terminated employment period. Retirement allowances applicable to subsequent employment periods shall be calculated based on the provisions of the fund in effect at the time of termination of each subsequent employment period. The retirement allowances for subsequent employment periods shall be combined with the retirement allowance for the original employment period, the total of which shall establish the member's retirement allowance. Notwithstanding the above, if the last reemployment period began prior to October 1, 2007, one (1) retirement allowance will be calculated based upon the sum of all credited service earned and the member's average final compensation which shall establish the member's retirement allowance.

Sec. 31-39. - Reemployment of a retired member receiving retirement benefits. 
Upon reemployment by a participating employer of a retiree into a position that accrues credited service in the fund or in the city's VRS plan under section 31-34, all retirement benefits then being received by the retiree shall cease and shall not resume during any such reemployment period. Upon termination of the reemployment period, a retirement allowance will be calculated as follows: 
(a)  If the last reemployment period began prior to October 1, 2007, one (1) retirement allowance will be calculated based upon the sum of all credited service earned and the member's average final compensation which shall establish the member's revised retirement allowance. 
(b)  If any reemployment period began on or after October 1, 2007, but before March 1, 2010, a retirement allowance for such reemployment period will be calculated based upon the compensation paid and credited service earned during the reemployment period, and this amount shall be combined with the retirement allowance the member was receiving immediately prior to the reemployment period which shall establish the member's revised retirement allowance. 
(c)  If any reemployment period began on or after March 1, 2010, upon termination of the reemployment period, the member's previous retirement allowance under the fund shall resume.

In addition, the retirement allowance from the city shall also be reduced by the amount of any lump sum settlement of a workers' compensation claim, except such portion of the settlement as is designated for the payment of medical expenses. 
(d)  Except for those members who have elected a lump sum payment under section 31-64.2, in no event shall a member's annual retirement allowance payable from the fund be less than three hundred thirty dollars ($330.00) or more than:

Sec. 31-56. - Occupational disability retirement for a total and permanent disability. 
(a)  VRS participants are ineligible for the benefits provided by this section. All other members shall be referred to as "eligible members" in this section. 
(b)  Subject to subsection (a) of this section, on and after October 1, 2007, an eligible member in active service who has been determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission from a cause arising out of and in the course of their employment with a participating employer may, upon written application to the board, be retired [eligible] for occupational disability retirement when, as a result of a medical examination or by means of other satisfactory evidence, the board finds that the member is permanently functionally incapacitated from performing any gainful activity and that such condition appears to be permanent. Benefits hereunder shall continue only so long as such incapacity continues based on evidence acceptable to the board. 
(c)  In the event of the retirement of an eligible member for occupational disability on or after January 1, 1983, such eligible member shall receive a disability retirement allowance payable for the lifetime of the eligible member so long as the eligible member remains totally disabled. The amount of the annual allowance shall be two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the eligible member's annual salary at the time the disability began less: 
(1)  The amount of any payments made to the eligible member by the participating employer pursuant to the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, §§ 65.2-500, 65.2-501, 65.2-502, 65.2-503, and 65.2-512 of the Code of Virginia.

In addition, the retirement allowance from the city shall also be reduced by the amount of any lump sum settlement of a workers' compensation claim, except such portion of the settlement as is designated for the payment of medical expenses. 
(2)  One-half (½) of the disability benefit received by the eligible member from the United States Social Security Administration or successor. 
(3)  Compensation received by the eligible member from the city under any applicable rule or order, settlement, contract or other agreement. 
(d)  Should an eligible member die while on occupational disability retirement, benefits shall be computed in accordance with section 31-62. 
(e)  An eligible member applying for disability retirement or retired on disability under this section shall be governed by the rules and regulations promulgated by the board in accordance with section 31-22 and section 31-59. 
(Ord. No. 2990-82; Ord. No. 5042-97; Ord. No. 5076-97; Ord. No. 6434-07, § 1; Ord. No. 6630-09, § 1)  
Sec. 31-57. - Nonoccupational disability retirement for a total and permanent disability. 
(a)  VRS participants are ineligible for the benefits provided by this section. All other members shall be referred to as "eligible members" in this section. 
(b)  On or after October 1, 2007, an eligible member in active service who is vested and is not eligible for regular service retirement, and who is totally and permanently disabled from a cause not compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act may, upon written application to the board, be considered for nonoccupational disability retirement when, as a result of a medical examination or by means of other satisfactory evidence, the board finds that the eligible member is functionally incapacitated from performing any gainful activity and that such condition appears to be permanent. Benefits hereunder shall continue only so long as such incapacity continues based on evidence acceptable to the board. 
(c)  In the event of the retirement of an eligible member for nonoccupational disability on or after January 1, 1983, such eligible member shall receive a disability retirement allowance payable monthly for the lifetime of the eligible member so long as the eligible member remains totally disabled. The amount of the annual allowance shall be computed as twenty (20) percent of the eligible member's average final compensation at date of disability retirement for the first five (5) years of the eligible member's credited service at such date plus one (1) percent of such average final compensation for each such year of credited service in excess of five (5). 
(d)  Should an eligible member die while on nonoccupational disability retirement, benefits shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of section 31-61, based on the eligible member's credited service as of the eligible member's date of disability retirement under this section. 
(e)  An eligible member applying for disability retirement or retired on disability under this section shall be governed by the rules and regulations promulgated by the board in accordance with section 31-22 and section 31-59.

Sec. 31-58. - Occupational and nonoccupational partial disability benefits. 
(a)  VRS participants are ineligible for the benefits provided by this section. All other members shall be referred to as "eligible members" in this section. 
(b)  As a result of medical examination or otherwise, if the board determines that an eligible member who has applied for disability retirement under section 31-56 or section 31-57 is not totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of those sections, but determines that the such eligible member is partially disabled to the extent that the eligible member is functionally incapacitated from performing the essential functions of the eligible member's position with the participating employer, and as a result of such partial disability, terminates employment with the participating employer or transfers to a position with the participating employer at a lower salary, the eligible member may be awarded a partial disability benefit. Such benefit shall not be deemed to be a retirement allowance. Benefits hereunder shall continue only so long as such incapacity continues based on evidence acceptable to the board. 
(c)  Based on available medical and other relevant evidence, the board shall determine on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis with respect to similarly situated eligible members the extent of the partial disability. The partial disability benefit shall be a percentage of the allowance that would have been payable had the eligible member qualified for disability retirement under section 31-56 or section 31-57, after deducting from the allowance workers' compensation benefits awarded to the eligible member in the same amount and in the same manner as required by subsection 31-56(c)(1), such percentage being the percentage by which the eligible member is deemed partially disabled. Except as otherwise provided in this section, once the initial disability percentage has been established, it shall not be increased. 
(d)  Additional benefits shall be granted by the board by increasing the initial disability percentage at the rate of two (2) percent per full year of credited service. The total percentage awarded pursuant to this section shall not exceed the lesser of two (2) times the initial disability percentage recommendation or eighty (80) percent. 
(e)  Except as provided in subsection (f) or (g) of this section, disability benefit payments shall begin accruing on the effective date of disability and shall be payable monthly on the last working day of each month so long as the eligible member's partial disability continues, as determined by the board on evidence acceptable to it. 
(f)  In the case of a vested eligible member receiving a partial disability benefit who is not employed by the participating employer, the partial disability benefit will terminate when the eligible member attains the minimum age of retirement and the eligible member's benefit will convert to a service retirement. 
(g)  In the case of an eligible member who is not vested and is receiving a partial occupational disability benefit, the partial occupational disability benefit will terminate when the eligible member attains the minimum age of retirement. 
(h)  Notwithstanding receipt of benefits pursuant to this section, partially disabled eligible members who work for a participating employer during their period of disability shall accrue benefits under this chapter. 
(i)  An eligible member applying for or receiving benefits under this section shall be governed by the rules and regulations promulgated by the board in accordance with section 31-22 and section 31-59. 
(Ord. No. 2990-82; Ord. No. 4706-95; Ord. No. 5076-97; Ord. No. 6434-07, § 1; Ord. No. 6630-09, § 1)  
Sec. 31-59. - Annual review of disability recipients; continuation, cessation or adjustment of allowances or benefits. 
(a)  The board, or the disability review committee, may require any recipient of a disability retirement allowance pursuant to section 31-56 or section 31-57 of this Code, or of a partial disability benefit pursuant to section 31-58 of this Code, to undergo medical and functional capacity examinations by a physician or other qualified professional selected by the fund prior to the date on which the recipient attains age sixty (60). Should a recipient refuse to submit to any such examination, the recipient's disability retirement allowance or partial disability benefit shall be discontinued during the continuation of such refusal; and should such refusal continue for one (1) year, all the recipient's rights to any further disability retirement allowance or partial disability benefit payments shall cease. 
(b)  Whenever, as a result of a medical or functional capacity examination of a recipient of a disability retirement allowance as provided for in subsection (a) of this section, or other relevant evidence, the board determines that such recipient is no longer totally and permanently disabled, and is engaged in gainful activity or is able to engage in gainful activity, the disability retirement allowance shall cease. Except as provided in section 31-58(h), the period during which the recipient received a disability retirement allowance shall not be counted as credited service. 
(c)  Whenever a disability retirement allowance is terminated under subsection (b) of this section, but the board determines that the recipient remains partially disabled due to the same disability for which the retirement allowance was initially awarded, to the extent that the recipient is still incapable of performing the essential functions of the recipient's former position with the participating employer and the recipient's earning capacity has been reduced permanently by such partial disability, such recipient shall be awarded a partial disability benefit in place of the terminated disability retirement allowance. Such partial disability benefit shall be governed in every respect by the provisions of section 31-58, as though it had been awarded initially in lieu of a disability retirement allowance and shall commence immediately upon termination of the disability retirement allowance. 
(d)  Whenever, as a result of a medical or functional capacity examination of a recipient of a partial disability benefit as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or other relevant evidence, the board determines that there has been an improvement in the recipient's medical condition related to the same disability for which the partial disability benefit was initially awarded to the extent that the recipient is capable of performing the essential functions of the recipient's former position with the participating employer, the board shall reevaluate such recipient's partial disability benefit. 
(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, the board's decision to grant, deny or terminate a disability retirement allowance or a partial disability benefit need never be based solely on the results of a medical examination. The board may also consider reports of vocational rehabilitation counselors, financial evidence, the testimony of lay and expert witnesses, whether the applicant or recipient is receiving disability benefits under social security or the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act and any other relevant evidence. The recipient shall annually submit a report on the recipient's personal efforts toward rehabilitation, along with a written statement attesting to the fact that there has been no change in the recipient's condition which would result in any adjustment to or cessation of disability benefits, or if changes have occurred, a statement describing any such change. In addition to such annual reporting, or as otherwise required by the board, it shall be the duty of any recipient of a disability retirement allowance or a partial disability benefit to notify the board within thirty (30) days of any material change in the recipient's medical condition, or of any gainful activity in which the recipient becomes engaged. Failure of the recipient to furnish the information required by the board under this subsection in a timely manner or failure of the recipient to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation counselors in order to derive maximum benefit from rehabilitation services offered at the participating employer's expense shall constitute grounds for the board to deny or terminate the disability retirement allowance or to deny or order a reduction or cessation of the partial disability benefit to such recipient.

(c)  Should the spouse of an employee with a dependent child or children of the deceased employee remarry, then each such dependent child shall be entitled to twenty (20) percent of the final salary of the deceased employee; provided, however, that aggregate payments to such children shall be limited to eighty (80) percent of the deceased employee's final salary, payable until the earlier of the child's death or until no longer a dependent child. 
(d)  The benefits provided for in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be subject to reduction so that the benefits paid from the fund to the surviving dependents of an employee, together with income from workers' compensation benefits, social security benefits, VRS, and amounts otherwise payable by the participating employer under any applicable law, rule or order, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of the deceased employee's final salary. 
(e)  In addition to the other benefits provided by this section, there shall be paid to the surviving spouse of the deceased employee or, if none, the beneficiary designated by the deceased member, or if none, the estate of the employee, a lump sum death benefit amount equal to five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00) multiplied by the number of full years of credited service of the employee at date of death, subject to a minimum payment of five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00) and a maximum of three thousand three hundred dollars ($3,300.00).

(c)  If a deceased vested employee is survived by a spouse at the date of such employee's death, there shall be payable to said spouse, until the death or remarriage of that spouse, a benefit equal to fifty (50) percent of the annual retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled had the deceased employee retired on the date of death. Attainment of the minimum retirement age shall not be a prerequisite for receipt of this retirement benefit and shall not affect the computation thereof. 
(d)  If a deceased vested employee is not survived by a spouse at the date of such employee's death, or the surviving spouse subsequently dies and the deceased vested employee is survived by one (1) or more dependent children, the benefit which would have been or was payable to the surviving spouse under the provisions of subsection (c) above, shall be payable to, or for the benefit of, the surviving dependent child or children, payable until the earlier of the dependent child's death or until no longer a dependent child. If a member is survived by more than one (1) dependent child, and if one (1) or more of them subsequently becomes ineligible to receive a share of the benefit, then the benefit shall be shared equally by the remaining eligible dependent children. Attainment of the minimum retirement age shall not be a prerequisite for receipt of this retirement benefit and shall not affect the computation thereof. 
(e)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the benefits provided for in this section shall be payable to a recipient only as long as the recipient is eligible to receive such benefits based on the provisions of this section and evidence acceptable to the board.

Sec. 31-64. - Eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  This section 31-64 applies to distributions after December 31, 1992. A distributee of a lump sum payment under sections 31-60(e), 31-61(b), 31-62(a)(1), 31-62(b)(1), 31-68(e), 31-68(f), and 31-68(g) may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution that is equal to at least two hundred dollars ($200.00) paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. If an eligible rollover distribution is less than two hundred dollars ($200.00), a distributee may not make the election described in the preceding sentence to rollover a portion of the eligible rollover distribution. 
(b)  An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the member's benefit payable to the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: (i) any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under IRC section 401(a)(9); (iii) any distribution that is made upon the hardship of the member; and (iv) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. 
(c)  An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in IRC section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC section 408(b), an annuity plan described in IRC section 403(a), or a qualified trust described in IRC section 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a beneficiary of a death benefit who is not treated by the federal Internal Revenue Code as a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.

Eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in IRC section 403(b) and an eligible plan under IRC section 457 which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from the fund. 
For distributions made after December 31, 2007, an eligible retirement plan also means a Roth individual retirement account defined in IRC section 408A provided that, for distributions made in plan years prior to 2010, the distributee's modified adjusted gross income does not exceed the limitations in IRC section 408A(d)(3)(A). 
(d)  A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order, as defined in IRC section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

Sec. 31-64.1. - Limitations on benefits. 
(a)  Defined benefit limitations. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions in this article, the maximum annual benefit to which a member is entitled from the fund shall not exceed the application limitations of IRC section 415(b). The limitations of IRC section 415(b) and the final Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, as published on April 5, 2007, are hereby incorporated by reference. The limitations shall be applied on a uniform basis with respect to all similarly situated members in a limitation year. 
The maximum benefits provided under the fund shall not exceed the maximum amounts permitted by IRC section 415(b). The amount payable to a member in any limitation year shall not exceed the IRC section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity commencement date, without regard to the cost-of-living adjustments described in paragraph (3) below. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection 31-64.1 and the provisions of IRC section 415, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of IRC section 415. 
(2)  If the maximum annual benefit under this article (but for this section) would exceed the limitations of IRC section 415(b), the maximum annual benefit under any other defined benefit plan required to be aggregated with the fund shall be reduced under the other defined benefit plan prior to the reduction of the maximum annual benefit from the fund, in accordance with final Treasury Regulation section 1.415(a)-1(d)(3)(iii). 
(3)  In the event that the annual pension otherwise payable to a member who has retired or terminated employment has been limited by IRC section 415(b) as it existed at the member's retirement or termination date, the member's annual pension shall be adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living, as permitted by final Treasury Regulation section 1.415(d)-1, pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.415(a)-1(d)(3)(v), which is incorporated by reference. 
(4)  For purposes of determining a member's maximum benefit, remuneration paid or made available to the member during the limitation year shall include amounts described in IRC section 415(c)(3) and final Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2(a). In addition, post-severance remuneration shall mean post-severance remuneration as defined in final Treasury Regulation section 1.415(c)-2(e)(3)(ii), and any payment that is for accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the member would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; payment to an individual who does not currently perform services for the participating employer by reason of qualified military service, to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received had the individual continued to perform services for the participating employer rather than entering qualified military service; and any payment that is made to a member who is totally and permanently disabled as determined by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission, provided salary continuation applies to all members who are permanently and totally disabled for a fixed or determinable period. Further, for limitation years beginning on and after July 1, 2009, (i) an individual who is in qualified military service and receiving a differential wage payment, as defined by IRC section 3401(h)(2), from the city shall be treated as an employee of the city, and (ii) in accordance with IRC section 414(u)(7), the differential wage payment shall be treated as remuneration. 
(b)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the benefit of each member shall commence no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70½), or (ii) the calendar year in which the member retires. This period shall be known as the member's required beginning date. The fund is intended and believed to be in compliance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of IRC section 401(a)(9). IRC section 401(a)(9) is incorporated by reference herein. The requirements of this section shall apply to any distribution of a member's retirement allowance and override any distribution option in the fund that is otherwise inconsistent with IRC section 401(a)(9) and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the fund. 
(2)  Retirement distributions may only be made over a period not to exceed the life of the member or the joint lives of the member and the member's beneficiary. For this purpose, the form of distribution shall include the death benefits payable under section 31-62. 
(3)  If the distribution of a member's benefit has commenced and the member dies before the member's entire benefit has been distributed to the member, the remaining portion of such benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the form of distribution in effect at the member's date of death. For this purpose, the form of distribution shall include the death benefits payable under section 31-62. 
(4)  If a member dies before distributions begin, the member's benefit will be distributed in accordance with the following: 
a.  If a benefit is paid to a spouse or dependent child pursuant to section 31-60 (other than subsection (e) thereof), section 31-61 (other than subsection (b) thereof), or section 31-63 (other than subsection (a) thereof), such benefit shall commence no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit to such spouse or dependent child shall be paid over the period specified in sections 31-60, 31-61, or 31-63, as applicable, which period shall not exceed the life of the spouse or dependent child. 
b.  If the benefit is paid other than as described in subsection a., above, any distribution payable under the terms of this article shall be completed no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
The benefits payable under the provisions of this article may not be paid in any form which would violate the required distribution requirements of this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 7131-14, § 1)  
Sec. 31-64.2. - Lump sums. 
Any member eligible to receive an annual retirement allowance may at the time of retirement, if they meet the terms described below, make an irrevocable election to receive a one (1) time, lump sum payment in lieu of any benefits they, their surviving spouse, their surviving dependent(s), and/or any other beneficiary (including their estate) would otherwise be eligible to receive under this article. This election may be made at the time of retirement and is not available to those already receiving an annual retirement allowance. 
(a)  Any member who would receive a retirement allowance of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) or less per month, may elect, at the time of retirement to receive their benefit in a one-time, lump sum payment. 
(b)  The total amount of the one-time, lump sum payment shall be based upon the value of the retirement allowance plus the death benefit referenced at section 31-62(b)(1) at an actuarially neutral rate as determined by the fund's actuary and approved by the board from time to time and set forth in a schedule to be maintained by the board. For the purposes of this section, an actuarially neutral rate uses actuarial assumptions adopted by the board so that the lump sum payment will have no adverse financial impact to the fund. 
(c)  Upon electing to receive a one-time, lump sum payment, the member shall sign a certification indicating that they acknowledge that they fully understand that the one-time, lump sum payment will be in lieu of any benefits that they, their surviving spouse, their surviving dependent(s), and/or any other beneficiary (including their estate), would otherwise be eligible to receive under this article. 
(d)  The terms of this section do not apply to the provisions of article III of chapter 31. 
(Ord. 7278-16, § 1)  
DIVISION 6. - FUNDING 
 
Sec. 31-65. - Retirement and benefits reserve. 
(a)  All of the assets of the fund shall be held in a retirement and benefits reserve, in which shall be accumulated all assets transferred from any predecessor fund, all contributions made pursuant to this division or any other provision of this article, all receipts from purchases of credited service by members, and to which all income from the invested assets of the fund shall be credited. From this reserve shall be paid the retirement allowances and the other benefits of the fund as provided for in this article, as well as the expenses provided for in section 31-80 and section 31-81. 
(b)  The annual contributions to the reserve shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 51, § 6; Ord. No. 991, § 1; Code 1961, § 32-12; Ord. No. 2364; Ord. No. 2379; Ord. No. 2709-80; Ord. No. 6434-07, § 1)  
Sec. 31-66. - Contributions by members. 
(a)  From January 1, 1983, through December 31, 2012, no contributions to the reserve shall be required or permitted to be made by members, except as otherwise provided in this division. 
(b)  As of the first payroll period commencing after January 1, 2013, all members, other than city council and members who are employees of the school board, shall contribute five (5) percent of such member's compensation (as defined in section 31-25) for each pay period for which the member receives compensation. The participating employer shall deduct from the member's compensation the required contribution by salary reduction pursuant to IRC section 414(h) on a pre-tax basis. Member contributions under this section 31-66 shall be deemed "picked up" by the participating employer and shall be treated as employer contributions for tax purposes. 
(c)  As of the first payroll period commencing after July 1, 2013, all non-VRS members who are employees of the school board shall contribute two (2) percent of such member's compensation (as defined in section 31-25) for each pay period for which the member receives compensation through June 30, 2014. Thereafter, contribution levels for such members shall be determined at the discretion of the school board but shall be increased by no less than one (1) percent for each succeeding fiscal year and such employee contributions shall equal five (5) percent of the member's compensation no later than July 1, 2016. The school board shall deduct from the member's compensation the required contribution by salary reduction pursuant to IRC section 414(h) on a pre-tax basis. Member contributions under this section 31-66 shall be deemed "picked up" by the participating employer and shall be treated as employer contributions for tax purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2709-80; Ord. No. 2971-82; Ord. No. 6434-07, § 1; Ord. No. 6923-12, § 1)  
Sec. 31-67. - Contributions by participating employers. 
(a)  Each participating employer shall contribute to the reserve each year an amount which is determined as a percentage of the annual compensation of the members who are employed by such participating employer. The required contribution rates shall be established in accordance with the following provisions of this section. 
(b)  To compute the required contribution rates for each participating employer, the board shall engage an actuary who shall be a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and shall be enrolled by the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries. Using recognized actuarial principles in conjunction with methods and assumptions approved by the board, the actuary, on the basis of actuarial valuations made no less frequently than biennially, shall advise the board as to the contribution rates for each participating employer, expressed as percentages of the compensation of the members, that, when combined with member contributions under section 31-66, are projected to remain sufficient, on a long-term basis, to support the benefits to be paid in the future to members who are or were employed by such participating employer. 
(c)  Based on the most recent actuarial valuation and contribution rate computations made by the actuary pursuant to subsection (b) above, for each fiscal year the board shall certify to the school board the required contribution rates with respect to members employed by the school board and to the city council the required contribution rates with respect to all other members. 
(d)  The school board, with respect to members employed by it, and the city council, with respect to all other members, shall appropriate, and the respective participating employers shall contribute annually to the reserve, the dollar amounts resulting from the application of the certified contribution rates to the annual compensation of the members employed by the respective participating employers. In determining the amount of any contribution, a reasonable approximation to the exactly computed amount may be used. 
(e)  For any year in which the participating employers' aggregate contributions computed as provided in the preceding subsections are insufficient, when combined with the amount then held in the reserve, to provide the benefits payable from the reserve in such year, the participating employers shall make an additional contribution in the amount necessary to overcome the deficit. 
(Ord. No. 51, § 6; Ord. No. 991, § 1; Code 1961, § 32-12; Ord. No. 2364; Ord. No. 2379; Ord. No. 2709-80; Ord. No. 2971-82; Ord. No. 6434-07, § 1; Ord. No. 6923-12, § 1)

(b)  Each member shall have a fully vested right to the balance of his member contribution account at all times without regard to the service requirements of section 31-36. 
(c)  At the end of each payroll period, the participating employer shall transfer to the member contribution account an amount equal to the amount of the employee contribution for such payroll period. 
(d)  Each individual member contribution account shall be credited with interest at the rate specified by the board from time to time on the accumulated member contributions beginning at the end of the fiscal year in which the contribution was made. The board shall have the authority to determine the manner in which the interest is credited to the member contribution account. 
(e)  A member who incurs a separation from service prior to becoming a vested member under section 31-36 shall receive a lump-sum distribution of the balance of his member contribution account as soon as practicable following the date of the member's separation from service. Any distribution made under this section 31-68(e) which the member does not elect to (i) receive directly or (ii) have paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member in a direct rollover in accordance with section 31-64, shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For member account balances of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, by distribution directly to the member, subject to applicable tax withholdings. 
(2)  For member account balances exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), by direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the board. 
(f)  If a vested member dies after separation from service but prior to the date that benefit payments commence under section 31-54, 31-56, or 31-57, the balance of the member contribution account shall be distributed as soon as practicable following the date of the member's death. This distribution shall be made to the member's surviving spouse, or if none, to the member's surviving dependent children, or if none, to the beneficiary designated by the deceased member for purposes of receiving the death benefit under sections 31-60 or 31-61, or if none, to the estate of the deceased member. The survivor benefit payable under section 31-63 shall be reduced such that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to be paid to the beneficiary equals the actuarial equivalent of the benefit payable under section 31-63 (prior to reduction under this section) minus the actuarial equivalent of the balance of the member contribution account at the time of distribution to the beneficiary. 
(g)  A vested member may make an irrevocable election, at any time after separation from service but prior to the date that benefit payments commence under sections 31-54, 31-56, or 31-57, to receive a distribution of the balance of his member contribution account in a single lump-sum payment. If such an election is made, the benefit payable under sections 31-54, 31-56, or 31-57, as applicable, shall be reduced such that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to be paid to the member equals the actuarial equivalent of the benefit payable under sections 31-54, 31-56, or 31-57, as applicable (prior to reduction under this section), minus the actuarial equivalent of the balance of the member contribution account at the time of distribution to the member. 
(h)  The member contribution account exists solely as a recordkeeping entry and does not grant any member a right or interest in any specific assets of the plan. Member contributions may be mingled with employer contributions and other funds maintained by the plan.

Editor's note Ord. No. 6696-10, §§ 24, adopted and effective June 22, 2010, provides that: Any post-retirement medical and dental benefits, and life insurance, for retirees of the Newport News Public School System shall be governed by the policies and procedures of the Newport News School Board.   Pursuant to Newport News School Board Resolution No. 09-11, as amended, (adopted May 19, 2009) the School Board established an other post-employment benefits ("OPEB") trust in accordance with Virginia law in order to accumulate and invest assets to fund such benefits. The amendments to the City Code which delete reference to OPEB benefits for School Board employees will be accompanied by actions which transfer an actuarial determined portion of the post-retirement fund to the School Board which will deposit such funds in the School Board's separate fund. That amount is based on the July 1, 2009 actuarial valuation of the post-retirement fund in the amount of $1,627,570.   Effective July 1, 2009, School Board participation in, and contribution to, the post-retirement fund ceased.

Sec. 31-110. - General provisions. 
(a)  Effective January 1, 2000, the fund will experience rate medical plans for city retirees based on the actual cost of providing city sponsored post-retirement medical benefits to the city retirees. City sponsored post-retirement medical benefits offered to city retirees until eligible to receive both Part "A" and Part "B" Medicare coverage shall include only the following types of coverages: (i) single, (ii) single and one minor, (iii) single and spouse, and (iv) family. 
(b)  Upon becoming eligible to receive both Part "A" and Part "B" Medicare coverage, city retirees and spouses shall obtain both Part "A" and Part "B" Medicare coverage, and their post-retirement medical benefits shall then consist of the Medicare plan. 
(c)  City retirees may continue only the medical plan coverages, if any, in effect for them as of the effective date of their retirement. After retirement, coverage levels may not be increased by a retiree. Coverage levels may be decreased at the option of a retiree or in accordance with the provisions of the city's post-retirement medical plan. Once decreased, coverage levels may not subsequently be increased. 
(d)  The spouse of a deceased city retiree who is eligible to receive a monthly spousal annuity under article II of this chapter may elect to continue medical coverage through the fund at the level existing on the date of the retiree's death. Such coverage may not be increased by the surviving spouse, but may be decreased at the option of the surviving spouse or in accordance with the provisions of the city's post-retirement health plan. 
(e)  A dependent child of a deceased city retiree who is receiving a monthly annuity under article II of this chapter may elect to continue medical coverage through the fund at the level existing on the date of the retiree's death. Such coverage may not be increased by a dependent child, but may be decreased at the option of a dependent child or in accordance with the provisions of the city's post-retirement health plan. 
(f)  A member who is receiving an occupational or a non-occupational partial disability benefit pursuant to the provisions of section 31-58 of this chapter may continue medical coverage through the fund at the level existing on the effective date of the partial disability.

(g)  Post-retirement medical insurance premiums are due and payable in advance on the first city business day of each month. To the extent a recipient's monthly benefit payment under article II of this chapter is sufficient to pay the required insurance premiums, such premiums shall be deducted from the recipients' benefit payment. To the extent a recipient's monthly benefit payment is not sufficient to pay the required insurance premiums, the recipient shall be responsible for remitting the deficiency prior to the next premium due date. If the premium payment or any deficiency payment is not received by the city's department of finance within thirty (30) days after notice is given to the insured, coverage will be terminated with no right of reinstatement.

For purposes of this subsection, the term "city retiree" in section 31-110 means an employee of the city, an employee of an elected official, and an elected official, with at least five (5) years of actual service immediately prior to retirement.

Sec. 33-19. - Charges. 
(a)  Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following words shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section: 
(1)  Assessed shall mean the process to impose taxes or assessments upon abutting property owners for construction of sanitary sewers within the city as authorized by Title 15.2 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. 
(2)  Corner lot shall mean a lot abutting upon two (2) or more streets at their intersection, the shortest side fronting upon a street shall be considered the front of the lot, and the longest side fronting upon a street shall be considered the side of the lot. 
(3)  Frontage shall mean that portion of any real property abutting directly on a public right-of-way. 
(b)  Connection charge. A connection charge for connection with sewers shall be paid to the city for each lot or parcel of land to be served by such sewers as follows: 
(1)  For single-family units when the lot or parcel of land has not been assessed, the charge shall be three thousand five hundred thirty-one dollars ($3,531.00) plus a fee of one thousand four hundred eleven dollars ($1,411.00) for the installation of a lateral. If a lateral had been previously installed to serve the property, no installation fee shall be paid at the time of connection. 
(2)  For other than single-family units when the lot or parcel of land has not been assessed, the charge shall be computed by multiplying the actual frontage of the lot or parcel of land by sixty dollars and twenty cents ($60.20) and adding thereto the applicable charge specified in (b)(4) of this section. 
(3)  When the lot or parcel of land has been assessed, the charge shall be that specified in (b)(4) of this section. 
a.  Single-familyIf a lot or parcel of land which has been assessed is subdivided to create additional single-family lots or parcels, the charge for each lot or parcel not already connected to the sewer system shall be in accordance with (b)(1) of this section. 
b.  Other than single-familyIf a lot or parcel of land which has been assessed is subdivided to create additional lots or parcels for development of other than single-family units, the charge for each lot or parcel not already connected to the sewer system shall be computed by multiplying the actual frontage of the lot or parcel of land by nine dollars and fifty-five cents ($9.55) and adding thereto the applicable charge specified in (b)(4) of this section. It is the council's intent to recognize in this subsection that there is but a single assessment for a subdividable parcel. A single lateral, hereafter termed the "primary lateral," is provided to parcels in sewer projects, although other laterals may be constructed if the property owner pays for the cost of materials and labor for such laterals. A connection fee shall therefore be paid for each new parcel created by subsequent subdivision of a parcel other than the parcel served, or capable of being served, by the "primary lateral." 
(4)  Flat rate charges shall be based on the following: 
a.  For a single-family unit when the lot or parcel has been assessed, a charge according to the following shall be paid: 
1.  Three hundred fifty-one dollars ($351.00) if paid in a single payment within the first twelve (12) months after the sewer involved was certified for connection. This reduced rate shall be available only to those property owners who obtain a building or plumbing permit within the first twelve (12) months after the sewer is certified for connection and connect within the time period specified in this section. 
2.  Seven hundred five dollars ($705.00) if not paid as provided in 1. immediately above. 
b.  For property other than single-family, a charge based on the following shall be paid: 
1.  For each multifamily unit: Four hundred ninety-four dollars ($494.00) per family unit. 
2.  For sewers serving commercial units: Seven hundred five dollars ($705.00) for the first lateral exiting the structure plus four hundred ninety-four dollars ($494.00) for each additional lateral. 
3.  For sewers serving parcels zoned Light Industrial District (M1) or Heavy Industrial District (M2): Seven hundred five dollars ($705.00). 
4.  For sewers serving mobile home parks: Four hundred ninety-four dollars ($494.00) per mobile home site. 
5.  For sewers serving hotels and/or similar establishments: Four hundred ninety-four dollars ($494.00) per unit. 
(c)  Subdivision lots. For sewers installed by a developer in accordance with the subdivision regulations, no charge shall be paid to the city under this section for those lots served by the sewer and for which the subdivision connection fee was paid by such developer, except as provided in (b)(3) of this section. 
(d)  Corner lots. For corner lots, the shortest side abutting a public street plus one-half (½) of the intersection arc distance shall be used in determining the frontage charge under this section, provided sixty (60) feet shall be the minimum distance used. 
(e)  Lots with no public street frontage. For lots which do not abut any public street, the shortest side of the lot shall be used in determining the frontage charge under this section, provided that sixty (60) feet shall be the minimum distance used. 
(f)  Other requests. When a sewer connection lateral larger than four (4) inches in diameter or an additional lateral is desired, the applicant for the permit required by this article shall pay the cost of labor and materials necessary to construct the same but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
(g)  Unusual cases. The city manager or his designee is authorized to make adjustments to the charges set forth in this section in instances where unusual property frontages exist. If the individual requesting a sewer connection establishes, to the satisfaction of the city manager or his designee, that the total frontage of his property does not represent frontage on developable property, the city manager or his designee may then reduce the frontage upon which the charge is based to that which represents frontage on developable property (but not to a figure which is less than sixty (60) feet). 
(h)  When charge due. The charge for connecting to the public sewer as herein set out shall be paid to the city as follows: 
(1)  For connections involving single-family units when the lot or parcel has not been assessed requested pursuant to (b)(1) and (b)(3)a., the charge shall be paid prior to the time application is made to the department of codes compliance for the building permit or the plumbing permit, whichever applies to the specific request. If the connection is not completed and approved by the plumbing inspector within the time specified by the pertinent permit, the charge less five hundred dollars ($500.00), to cover administrative costs associated with processing the application and the refund, shall be refunded to the applicant upon request. If the lateral was installed, the charge for the same shall not be refunded; however, if the lateral was not installed, the charge for the same shall be refunded to the applicant upon request. Any subsequent request for a sewer connection at the address involved shall follow the application process that is in effect at the time of such request. 
(2)  For existing buildings other than single-family that has not been assessed, the connection charge shall be paid prior to the time application is made to the department of codes compliance for the plumbing permit; provided, however, that in the case of properties that have been assessed, the plumbing permit shall be obtained within the first twelve (12) months after the sewer involved is certified for connection. If the connection is not completed and approved by the plumbing inspector within ninety (90) days after issuance of the plumbing permit, the charge less five hundred dollars ($500.00), if applicable, to cover administrative costs associated with processing the application and the refund, shall be retained with the reminder refunded to the applicant upon request. If the lateral was installed, the charge for the same shall not be refunded; however, if the lateral was not installed, the charge for the same shall be refunded to the applicant upon request. 
(3)  For new construction, the connection charge shall be paid prior to the time application is made to the department of codes compliance for the building permit; provided, however, that in the case of properties that have been assessed, the building permit shall be obtained within the first twelve (12) months after the sewer involved is certified for connection. If the connection to the public sewer is not completed and approved by the plumbing inspector within twelve (12) months after issuance of the building permit, the charge, less five hundred dollars ($500.00), if applicable, to cover administrative costs associated with processing the application and the refund, shall be retained with the remainder refunded to the applicant upon request. If the lateral was installed, the charge for the same shall not be refunded; however, if the lateral was not installed, the charge for the same shall be refunded to the applicant upon request.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 33.01-1. - Findings, purposes and intent; interpretation. 
(a)  Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas, and the safety and welfare of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all signs. This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision. 
(b)  A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interest identified in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition. 
(d)  These regulations distinguish between portions of the city designed for primarily vehicular access and portions of the city designed for primarily pedestrian access. 
(e)  These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the city. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one (1) or more of the purposes set forth above. 
(f)  These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
(Ord. No. 7494-18)

Sec. 33.02-2. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the orderly development of certain activities within the city and to ensure that such activities are developed in a manner that is harmonious with surrounding properties and consistent with the comprehensive plan of the city. If the requirements of this chapter will affect sites which are already developed, or which are partially developed, such sites should be brought into compliance as much as is possible with the provisions of this chapter without creating an undue hardship especially with regard to a potential need to demolish or relocate existing parking lots or structures. 
(b)  Intent. The intent of this chapter is to provide for a review of site development proposals in terms of: 
(1)  The compatibility of the project with its environment and with other land uses and buildings in the surrounding area. 
(2)  The quantity, quality, utility, size and type of the recreation space required because of the project. 
(3)  The impact of the project upon the existing natural environment and proposed landscaping improvements. The ecological balance among air, soil and water shall be preserved by the planting and retention of trees, landscaping and green areas since these features will cleanse stormwater runoff, stabilize soils, absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen and water vapor. 
(4)  The ability of the traffic circulation system for the project to provide for convenient and safe internal and external movement of vehicles and pedestrians, to include abatement measures for anticipated noise associated with increased traffic. 
(5)  The quantity, quality, utility and type of community facilities required because of the project. 
(6)  The location and adequacy of drainage facilities and other utility provisions associated with the project, whether existing or proposed.

The director shall chair such committee but, when desired, may designate a qualified representative from the department of planning to conduct committee meetings. 
(c)  Although the committee may take the regulations of other regulatory or governing bodies into consideration while reviewing a site plan, the director's approval of a plan does not relieve the requestor from the responsibility for complying with the regulations of such other bodies. 
(d)  A Class 2 site plan is not eligible for conditional approval; however, the director may grant conditional approval of a Class 1 site plan if, in the director's opinion, the proposed development activity can be started while the property owner completes minor actions related to the plans review process.

b.  If the director or his agent denies an extension requested as provided herein and the property owner or developer, as applicable, contends that such denial was not properly based on the ordinance, law or regulation applicable thereto, the foregoing considerations for granting an extension, or was arbitrary or capricious, he may appeal to the Circuit Court of Newport News, provided that such appeal shall be filed with the Circuit Court within sixty (60) days of the date of the written denial. 
c.  For so long as the approved site plan remains valid in accordance with the provisions of this section, no change or amendment to any city ordinance, map, resolution, rule, regulation, policy or plan adopted subsequent to the date of approval for such site plan shall adversely affect the right of the property owner or developer, as applicable, or his successor in interest, to commence and complete an approved development in accordance with the lawful terms of the approved site plan unless the change or amendment is required to comply with state law or there has been a mistake, fraud or a change in circumstances substantially affecting the public health, safety or welfare. 
d.  Application for minor modifications to approved site plans made during the periods of validity of such plans established in accordance with this section shall not constitute a waiver of the provisions hereof nor shall the approval of such minor modifications extend the period of validity of such plans.

(2)  If a class 2 site plan is involved, the director may, upon written request, reduce the percentage of landscaping and green area required, but not to less than ten (10) percent, with respect to a specific site under the following conditions: 
a.  The plan relates to modifying an existing building whose physical characteristics preclude full compliance; or, 
b.  Pre-existing physical characteristics of the site preclude full compliance (e.g., building takes up most of the property or limited setback distance is available). 
(3)  The minimum percentage of the site area that shall be designated as landscaping and green area in subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) above may be reduced by the director to no less than ten (10) percent for sites requiring a minimum of fifteen (15) percent green area and no less than twelve (12) percent for sites requiring a minimum of twenty (20) percent green area. Each of the following may account for up to one-third ( 1/3 ) of the allowable reduction: 
a.  Every additional tree planted over the minimum required may reduce the required landscaping and green area by three hundred (300) square feet. 
b.  Every additional shrub planted over the minimum required may reduce the required landscaping and green area by one hundred thirty-five (135) square feet. 
c.  Where parking is screened by an earthen berm or other visual barrier planted with approved ground cover and shrubs, and the top of berm is at least two and one-half (2.5) feet above ground and within a minimum slope of 2.5:1, each linear foot of such berm may be used to reduce the required landscaping and green area by fifty (50) square feet. Berms proffered can qualify for landscaping and green area reduction under this section. 
(4)  If a master landscape plan is approved by the director, all individual sites participating in such plan shall be able to reduce the minimum required landscaping and green area percentage to ten (10) percent where the minimum following criteria are included: 
a.  A landscape strip shall be established along all streets a minimum width of ten (10) feet from the property line or edge of a private street right-of-way. 
b.  Trees shall be planted at a minimum of thirty (30) feet on center in this strip exclusive of driveway entrances. 
c.  Shrubs shall be used to form a continuous hedge on at least fifty (50) percent of the right-of-way. 
d.  Berms with ground cover can be used in lieu of shrubs as a continuous visual barrier. 
e.  No more than five (5) trees shall be planted along the same line; staggering and other methods of creating variations are encouraged. To encourage the same effect, no hedge or berm shall continue more than sixty (60) feet along the same line. 
(5)  Trees or other landscaping shall not be placed or planted so as to interfere with the proper operation or maintenance of any utility line or apparatus or obstruct vehicular sight distances as defined in the design criteria manual. 
(6)  The site plan for any subdivision or development must include a provision that, at twenty (20) years, a minimum ten (10) percent tree canopy will be provided on the site of any cemetery as defined in the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, §54.1-2310, notwithstanding any other provision of this section. In no event shall any city tree replacement or planning ordinance adopted pursuant to this section exceed the requirements of this subsection.

(4)  Service charge adjustments shall be given to parcels that meet the conditions established in [subsection] (e)(2)a. and for which a reduction in the city stormwater management program costs can be documented to the satisfaction of the director. This is a stand alone adjustment that will be considered separate and not added to any other service charge adjustment. Any such credit shall be awarded on the basis of a "betterment" test and the reduction in the city's stormwater management program costs. The total maximum credit for this adjustment shall be seventy (70) percent of the service charge. 
(5)  A one hundred (100) percent service charge adjustment shall be granted upon approval of a request for those portions of parcels that are subject to and in compliance with the requirements of an individual federal or state industrial stormwater discharge permit, drain into a privately owned, operated and maintained storm drainage systems, and discharge directly into waters of the United States.

After the two (2) additional state permit cycles have passed, or should state permit coverage not be maintained, portions of the project not under construction shall become subject to any new technical criteria adopted since original state permit coverage was issued. For land-disturbing projects issued coverage under the July 1, 2009 state permit and for which coverage was maintained, such projects shall remain subject to the technical criteria of Part II C for an additional two (2) state permits. 
(f)  The city manager, or designee, may grant exceptions to the technical requirements of Part II B or Part II C of the Regulations, provided that, 
(i)  The exception is the minimum necessary to afford relief, 
(ii)  Reasonable and appropriate conditions are imposed so that the intent of the Act, the Regulations, and this ordinance are preserved, 
(iii)  Granting the exception will not confer any special privileges that are denied in other similar circumstances, and; 
(iv)  Exception requests are not based upon conditions or circumstances that are self-imposed or self-created. Economic hardship alone is not sufficient reason to grant an exception from the requirements of this article. 
(1)  Exceptions to the requirement that the land-disturbing activity obtain required VSMP authority permit shall not be given by the city manager, or designee, nor shall the city manager, or designee, approve the use of a BMP not found on the Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse Website, or any other control measure duly approved by the Department unless such BMP is contained in the City of Newport News Design Criteria Manual as of January 1, 2013 and is identified as being more stringent than state minimum requirements at the time of program submittal to the Department for review. 
(2)  Exceptions to requirements for phosphorus reductions shall not be allowed unless offsite options otherwise permitted pursuant to 9 VAC 25-870-69 have been considered and found not available.

A ten (10) percent late payment fee shall be charged to any delinquent (over ninety (90) days past due) account. The city shall be entitled to all remedies available under the Code of Virginia in collecting any past due amount. 
(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1; Ord. No. 7088-14, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-37.3. - Stormwater nonpoint nutrient offsets. 
(a)  As used in this section: 
Nonpoint nutrient offset means nutrient reductions certified as nonpoint nutrient offsets under the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Exchange Program (§ 62.1-44.19:12 et seq. [of the Code of Virginia]). 
Tributary has the same meaning as in Virginia Code § 62.1-44.19:13. 
(b)  The City of Newport News, through its approval of the stormwater management plan, may allow compliance with stormwater nonpoint nutrient runoff water quality criteria established pursuant to Virginia Code § 62.1-44.15:28, in whole or in part, through the use of acquisition of nonpoint nutrient offsets in the same tributary. 
(c)  Nonpoint nutrient offsets will not be allowed to address water quantity control requirements. Nonpoint nutrient offsets or other off-site options shall not be used in contravention of local water quality-based limitations: (i) consistent with determinations made pursuant to subsection B of Virginia Code § 62.1-44.19:14, (ii) adopted pursuant to Virginia Code § 62.1-44.15:33 or other applicable authority,, (iii) deemed necessary to protect public water supplies from adverse nutrient impacts, or (iv) as otherwise may be established or approved by the State Water Control Board. Where such a limitation exists, other off-site options may be used provided that such options do not preclude or impair compliance with the local limitation. 
(d)  Nonpoint nutrient offsets off-site options may only be used in the stormwater management plan when the: 
(1)  The applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city manager, or designee, that (i) alternative site designs have been considered that may accommodate on-site best management practices, (ii) on-site best management practices have been considered in alternative site designs to the maximum extent practicable, (iii) appropriate on-site best management practices will be implemented, and (iv) full compliance with post-development nonpoint nutrient runoff compliance requirements cannot practicably be met on site. For purposes of this subdivision, if an applicant demonstrates on-site control of at least seventy-five (75) percent of the required phosphorous nutrient reductions, the applicant shall be deemed to have met the requirements of clauses (i) through (iv); 
(2)  Less than five (5) acres of land will be disturbed; or 
(3)  The post-construction phosphorous control requirement is less than 10 (ten) pounds per year. 
(e)  Documentation of the acquisition of nonpoint nutrient offsets by the person proposing the stormwater management plan shall be provided to the permit issuing authority in a certification from an offset broker documenting the number of phosphorus nonpoint nutrient offsets acquired and the associated ratio of nitrogen nonpoint nutrient offsets at the offset generating facility. 
(f)  Nonpoint nutrient offsets used pursuant to subsection (b) shall be generated in the same or adjacent eight-digit hydrologic unit code as defined by the United States Geological Survey as the permitted site. Nonpoint nutrient offsets outside the same or adjacent eight-digit hydrologic unit code may only be used if it is determined by the city manager, or designee, that no nonpoint nutrient offsets are available within the same or adjacent eight-digit hydrologic unit code when the permit issuing authority accepts the final site design. In such cases, and subject to other limitations imposed in this section, nonpoint nutrient offsets generated within the same tributary may be used. In no case shall nonpoint nutrient offsets from another tributary be used. 
(g)  For that portion of a site's compliance with stormwater nonpoint nutrient runoff water quality criteria being obtained through nonpoint nutrient offsets, the city manager, or designee, shall (i) use a one-one-one (1:1) ratio of the nonpoint nutrient offsets to the site's remaining post-development nonpoint nutrient runoff compliance requirement and (ii) assure that the nonpoint nutrient offsets are secured in perpetuity. 
(h)  The city may not grant an exception to, or waiver of, post-development nonpoint nutrient runoff compliance requirements unless off-site options have been considered and found not available. 
(i)  Until July 1, 2014, priority was to be given to the use of nonpoint nutrient offsets unless the city manager, or designee, requires a pro-rata share payment plan pursuant to the Code of the City of Newport News, Appendix BSubdivision Regulations, Section 4.01.7 or to the Regional BMP Water Quality Banking Program Policy, as revised, adopted by Resolution No. 9418-99 adopted by the city council. In the case of a phased project, the permittee may acquire or achieve the off-site nutrient reductions prior to the commencement of each phase of the land-disturbing activity in an amount sufficient for each such phase. 
(j)  The city manager, or designee, will allow incorporation into or amendment to the stormwater management plan to reflect full or partial substitution of nonpoint nutrient offsets for existing on-site nutrient controls when (i) the nonpoint nutrient offsets will compensate for ten (10) or fewer pounds of the annual phosphorous requirement associated with the original land-disturbing activity or (ii) existing on-site controls are not functioning as anticipated after reasonable attempts to comply with applicable maintenance agreements or requirements and the use of nonpoint nutrient offsets will account for the deficiency. The party responsible for maintenance shall be released from maintenance obligations related to the on-site phosphorous controls for which the nonpoint nutrient offsets are substituted. 
(k)  To the extent available, with the consent of the proposer of the stormwater management plan, the city manager, or designee, may include the use of nonpoint nutrient offsets or other off-site measures in resolving enforcement actions to compensate for (i) nutrient control deficiencies occurring during the period of noncompliance and (ii) permanent nutrient control deficiencies. 
(l)  This section shall not be construed as limiting the authority established under Virginia Code § 15.2-2243; however, under any pollutant loading pro rata share program established thereunder, the subdivider or developer shall be given appropriate credit for nutrient reductions achieved through nonpoint nutrient offsets or other off-site options.  
Sec. 37.1-38. - Construction inspections. 
(a)  The city shall inspect the land-disturbing activity during construction for: 
(1)  Compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan; 
(2)  Compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
(3)  Development, updating, and implementation of a pollution prevention plan; and, 
(4)  Development and implementation of any additional control measures necessary to address a TMDL. 
(b)  The applicant shall notify the city manager, or designee, forty-eight (48) hours prior to the commencement of any activity covered by this article so that appropriate inspections can be made to insure compliance with this article. 
(c)  Inspection reports shall be maintained as part of the land development project file. 
(d)  The city may, at reasonable times and under reasonable circumstances, enter any establishment or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of obtaining information or conducting surveys or investigations necessary in the enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter to the extent allowed by applicable law. 
(e)  In accordance with a performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any combination thereof, or such other legal arrangement or instrument, the city manager or any duly authorized agent of the city manager may also enter any establishment or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of initiating or maintaining appropriate actions which are required by the permit conditions associated with a land-disturbing activity when a permittee, after proper notice, has failed to take acceptable action within the time specified to the extent allowed by applicable law. 
(f)  Pursuant to § 62.1-44.15:40 of the Code of Virginia, the city manager or any duly authorized agent of the city manager may require every VSMP authority permit applicant or permittee, or any such person subject to VSMP authority permit requirements under this Chapter, to furnish when requested such application materials, plans, specifications, and other pertinent information as may be necessary to determine the effect of his discharge on the quality of state waters, or such other information as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Chapter. 
(g)  Post-construction inspections of stormwater management facilities required by the provisions of this Chapter shall be conducted by the city pursuant to city adopted and State Board approved inspection program, and shall occur, at minimum, at least once every five (5) years except as may otherwise be provided for in section 37.1-39, below. 
(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-39. - Maintenance. 
(a)  Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of stormwater management facilities, unless assumed by a governmental agency, shall remain with the property owner and shall pass to any successor or owner. If portions of the land are to be sold, legally binding arrangements shall be made to pass the basic responsibility to successors in title. These arrangements shall designate for each parcel the property owner, governmental agency, or other legally established entity to be permanently responsible for maintenance. The documents prepared to accomplish the requirements of this subsection shall be reviewed and approved by the City Attorney and be recorded in the land records. 
(b)  In the case of developments where subdivision lots are to be sold, permanent arrangements satisfactory to the city manager, or designee, shall be made to insure continued performance of these obligations. 
(c)  In the event that the stormwater management facilities are in need of maintenance or become a danger to public safety or public health, the property owner shall be notified in writing, advised of the corrective measures required, and given a reasonable period of time to take necessary action. If the property owner fails or refuses to perform such maintenance and repair, the city has the authority to perform the work and to recover the costs from the responsible person. 
(d)  To ensure proper performance of the stormwater management facility between scheduled maintenance operations, the owner is responsible for inspecting the stormwater management facility on a semi-annual basis and after any storm which causes the capacity of the facility to be exceeded. All such inspection reports shall be appropriately sealed and signed by a professional registered in the Commonwealth of Virginia pursuant to Article 1 (§ 54.1-400 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia and submitted to the city manager, or designee, within thirty (30) days of the inspection. 
(e)  Right-of-entry agreements or easements shall be required from the applicant for purposes of inspection and maintenance by the city manager, or designee. 
(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1; Ord. No. 7088-14, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-40. - Enforcement. 
(a)  If it is determined that there is a failure to comply with the approved plan, notice shall be served upon the property owner by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the application or plan certification, or by delivery at the land development site to the agent or employee supervising such activities. 
(b)  The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. 
(c)  Upon failure to comply within the time specified, the permit or approval may be revoked and the property owner shall be deemed to be in violation of this article. 
(d)  Any person who willfully or knowingly violates any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment for each violation, or both, as provided for in § 62.1-44.15:49 of the Code of Virginia. 
(e)  The city may apply to the circuit court to enjoin a violation or a threatened violation of this article as provided for in §§ 62.1-44.15:42 and 62.1-44.15:49 of the Code of Virginia without the necessity of showing that an adequate remedy at law does not exist. 
(f)  Without limiting the remedies which may be obtained in this section, the city may bring a civil action against any person for violation of this article, or any condition of the permit or approval, or any provision of the local program. The action may seek to impose of a civil penalty of not more than thirty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($32,500.00) per day for each violation as provided for in § 62.1-44.15:49 of the Code of Virginia. 
(g)  With the consent of any person who has violated or failed, neglected or refused to obey this article or any condition of the permit or approval or any provision of the local program, the city may issue an order against or to such person for the payment of civil charges for violations in specific sums not to exceed the limit specified in subsection (f) of this section as provided for in § 62.1-44.15:49 of the Code of Virginia. Such civil charges shall be instead of any appropriate civil penalty which could be imposed under subsection (f).

Secs. 37.1-4137.1-45. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE V. - CHESAPEAKE BAY PRESERVATION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1, adopted November 26, 2013, effective on and after July 1, 2014, repealed the former art. V, §§ 37.1-4637.1-57, and enacted a new art. V as set out herein. The former art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 5991-03, § 1; Ord. No. 6097-05; Ord. No. 6517-08, § 1. 
 
Sec. 37.1-46. - Findings of fact. 
The Chesapeake Bay and its perennial tributaries constitute one (1) of the most important and productive estuarine systems in the world, providing economic and social benefits to the citizens of Newport News and the Commonwealth of Virginia. The health of the bay is vital to maintaining Newport News' economy and the welfare of its citizens. 
The industrialized portion of Newport News' waterfront constitutes one (1) of the most important industrial areas in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It provides economic and social benefits to Newport News, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. The continued economic health of the waterfront industrial areas is vital to maintaining Newport News' economy and the welfare of its citizens as a whole; however, protection of the economic health of these areas and improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay are not mutually exclusive. Measures consistent with the continued industrial use of Newport News' industrial waterfront areas are available and are used for the protection of the Chesapeake Bay. 
The Chesapeake Bay waters have been degraded significantly by many sources of pollution, including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and development. Existing waters are worthy of protection from degradation to guard against further pollution. Certain lands that are proximate to shorelines have intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform. Other lands have severe development constraints from flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. With proper management, these lands offer significant ecological benefits by providing water quality maintenance and pollution control, as well as flood and shoreline erosion control. 
There also exist, however, certain lands at or near the shoreline that, due to their intense development, installation of sea walls, riprap and impervious surface, have little or no remaining intrinsic water quality value. Although these lands must be monitored to ensure that there is no deterioration of existing water quality protection as a result of the continued intensive use of these properties, the regulations and application of this article to these lands must be tempered by a recognition of the existing intense use and landowners' rights to continue that use. Measures consistent with the current uses of these lands must be employed to protect the quality of the water of the Chesapeake Bay. 
All of these lands together, designated by the city council as Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas, are important in connection with the protection of the quality of water in the bay and consequently the quality of life in the City of Newport News and the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-47. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  This article is adopted to implement the requirements of §§ 62.1-44.15:67-79 et seq. of the Code of Virginia (The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act). The intent of the city council and the purpose of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect existing state and community waters. 
(2)  Restore state waters to a condition or quality that will permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth of all aquatic life, including game fish, which might reasonably be expected to inhabit them. 
(3)  Prevent any further increase in nonpoint source pollution. 
(4)  Reduce existing nonpoint source pollution in state and community waters in order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future citizens of the City of Newport News. 
(b)  A Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map has been prepared and adopted by city council that overlay's the city's 1:200 scale real estate assessment maps, so that any parcel of land lying in these areas can be generally identified. Site specific delineation of Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas shall be required as provided in section 37.1-50. Unless otherwise stated in this article, the review and approval procedures provided for in Chapter 13, Building Regulations; Article VII of this Chapter; Chapter 44, Wetlands; and, Chapter 45, Zoning Ordinance; Appendix B, Subdivision Regulations; Chapter 33.02, Site Plan Ordinance; and, all other applicable ordinances shall be followed in reviewing and approving development, redevelopment, and uses governed by this article. 
(c)  Future revisions to this article shall require approval from the City's Regulations Committee and Planning Commission, as well as from City Council.

Public roads means a publicly-owned road designed and constructed in accordance with water quality protection criteria at least as stringent as requirements applicable to the Virginia Department of Transportation, including regulations promulgated pursuant to (i) the Erosion and Sediment Control Law (§§ 62.1-44.15:51-66 of the Code of Virginia) and (ii) the Virginia Stormwater Management Act (§§ 62.1-44.15:24-50 of the Code of Virginia). This definition includes those roads where the Virginia Department of Transportation exercises direct supervision over the design or construction activities, or both, and cases where secondary roads are constructed or maintained, or both, in accordance with the City of Newport News standards. 
Redevelopment means the process of developing land in Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas, except for industrial waterfront intensely developed areas, that is currently or has been previously developed; provided that, to be considered developed a parcel must be or have been covered by at least sixty (60) percent impervious improvements within the five (5) years preceding the proposed development. 
Resource management area (RMA) means that component of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area that is not classified as the resource protection area. RMAs include land types that, if improperly used or developed, have the potential for causing significant water quality degradation or for diminishing the functional value of a resource protection area. 
Resource management area components. See section 37.1-49(a)(2). 
Resource protection area (RPA) means that component of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area comprised of lands adjacent to water bodies with perennial flow that have an intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform or are sensitive to impacts which may result in significant degradation to the quality of state and local waters. 
Resource protection area components. See section 37.1-49(a)(1). 
Seaward fifty (50) feet of resource protection area buffer means the fifty (50) feet of the RPA 100-foot buffer adjacent to RPA components identified in section 37.1-49(a)(1)a., b. and c. 
Silvicultural activities means forest management activities, including but not limited to the harvesting of timber, the construction of roads and trails for forest management purposes, and the preparation of property for reforestation that are conducted in accordance with the silvicultural best management practices developed and enforced by the state forester pursuant to § 10.1-1105 of the Code of Virginia and are located on property defined as real estate devoted to forest use under § 58.1-3230 of the Code of Virginia. 
Tidal shore means the area of land between mean low water level and mean high water level. 
Tidal wetlands means vegetated and non-vegetated wetlands as defined in § 28.2-1300 of the Code of Virginia, as amended. 
Usable land area means not less than eighty (80) percent of the minimum lot area required by the zoning ordinance (chapter 45 of the City Code) shall be usable land by reason of elevation above flood level and not less than fifty (50) percent of such required minimum lot area shall be usable by reason of absence of easements or servitudes; provided, however, that all of the minimum area required for the building itself together with its required front, side and rear yard lines shall be usable land landward of the resource protection area (RPA). 
Water-dependent facility means a development of land that cannot exist outside the resource protection area and must be located on the shoreline by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operation. These facilities include: 
(1)  Beaches and other public water-oriented recreation areas. 
(2)  Dry docks.

(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-49. - Areas of applicability. 
(a)  The general location of resource protection areas, resource management areas, and industrial waterfront and residential intensely developed areas are shown on the designated map adopted by city council. The map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, as adopted by the city council shall be a part of this article. 
(1)  The components of a resource protection area are: 
a.  Tidal wetlands; 
b.  Nontidal wetlands which are connected by surface flow and contiguous to tidal wetlands or water bodies with perennial flow; 
c.  Tidal shores; and 
d.  A buffer area not less than one hundred (100) feet in width, located adjacent to and landward of the components listed in subsections a. through c. above, and along both sides of any water body with perennial flow. The full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the resource protection area notwithstanding the presence of permitted uses, encroachments and permitted vegetation clearing in compliance with section 37.1-51. 
(2)  The components of a resource management area shall consist of all lands within one hundred (100) feet landward of the landward boundary of the resource protection area buffer and in addition includes all land containing slopes greater than fifteen (15) percent, all areas within the one hundred (100) year floodplain and highly erodible soils. Council may designate other lands it deems important to maintenance of water quality as resource management area. 
(3)  Industrial waterfront intensely developed areas (IWIDAs) are those portions of Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas so designated by the city council because of the intensity of industrial land uses located along the shoreline that are characterized by an absence of natural environmental features and a preponderance of impervious surface and bulkheaded or riprapped shoreline. 
Industrial waterfront IDAs are areas further characterized as areas where little of the natural environment remains and development has severely altered the natural state of the area. 
(b)  The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map is hereby declared to delineate the general location of Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas. Site specific delineation of Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas shall be required as provided in section 37.1-50. The city manager, or designee, shall have the final authority in cases of uncertainty to determine the extent of these areas by application of criteria set forth in this section. 
(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-50. - Interpretation of Chesapeake Bay Preservation areas. 
(a)  Delineation by the applicant. The site-specific boundaries of the resource protection area shall be determined by the applicant through the performance of an environmental site assessment, subject to review and approval by the city manager, or designee, in accordance with section 37.1-52, plan of development. The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Map shall be used as a guide to the general location of resource protection areas and resource management areas. However, a reliable on site evaluation shall be conducted to determine whether water bodies on or adjacent to the site have perennial flow and the resource protection area boundaries for the site shall be adjusted, as necessary, based upon the findings of the on site evaluation. The specific boundaries of the industrial waterfront are designated by the city council on the adopted Chesapeake Bay Area Map. The boundaries of the industrial waterfront IDA overlay the boundaries of the underlying resource protection area and resource management area. 
(b)  Delineation by the city manager, or designee. The city manager, or designee, when requested by an applicant wishing to construct a single-family residence or addition or accessory structure, may waive the requirement for an applicant performed environmental site assessment and the city shall perform the delineation. The applicant is responsible for incorporating this information into an application for a building permit. 
(c)  Where conflict arises over delineation. Where, when required pursuant to the terms of this article, the applicant has provided a site-specific delineation of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas, the city manager, or designee, will verify the accuracy of the boundary delineation. In determining the site-specific RPA boundary, the city manager, or designee, may render adjustments to the applicant's boundary delineation, in accordance with section 37.1-52, plan of development. In the event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the applicant, the applicant may seek relief, in accordance with the provisions of section 37.1-52(i), denial of plan, appeal of conditions or modifications. 
(Ord. No. 7017-13, § 1)  
Sec. 37.1-51. - Performance standards. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of these requirements, as set forth in section 37.1-47(a), is to establish criteria to implement the following objectives: prevent a net increase in nonpoint source pollution from development; achieve a ten (10) percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from redevelopment; and achieve a forty (40) percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from agricultural and silvicultural uses. 
The performance standards recognize that diverse local circumstances require varying methods for protecting water quality. The performance standards establish the means to minimize erosion and sedimentation potential, reduce land application of nutrients and toxins, and maximize rainwater infiltration. Where land is undeveloped and not actively used, natural ground cover, especially woody vegetation, is most effective in holding soil in place and preventing site erosion. Indigenous vegetation, with its adaptability to local conditions without the use of harmful fertilizers or pesticides, filters stormwater runoff. Minimizing impervious cover enhances rainwater infiltration and effectively reduces stormwater runoff potential. 
Industrial waterfront intensely developed areas do not lend themselves to compliance with the performance standards set forth above. Industrial waterfront IDAs are characterized by the absence of indigenous vegetation, the preponderance of impervious cover and the presence of intense industrial activities. The performance standards for industrial waterfront IDAs have been implemented in recognition that the remaining natural ground cover may not be effective in holding soil in place and preventing site erosion in areas subject to more intense activity and that infiltration of surface waters into the ground in these areas may lead to groundwater contamination. 
(b)  General performance standards for development and redevelopment. Performance standards for development and redevelopment within all Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas, except within industrial waterfront IDAs, are set forth in subsection (1). Performance standards for development and redevelopment within all resource protection areas, except within Industrial Waterfront IDAs, are set forth in subsection (2). Performance standards for development and redevelopment within industrial waterfront IDA's are set forth in subsection (3). 
(1)  Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas. The following performance standards for development and redevelopment apply in all Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas except industrial waterfront IDAs and as otherwise hereinafter set forth. 
a.

In lieu of the aforesaid permits, the applicant may present a letter from a licensed engineer certifying that in his opinion no such permits are required. A copy of said letter shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee. 
k.  Stormwater management criteria consistent with the water quality protection provisions of section 37.1-35 of article IV stormwater control regulations. 
1.  The following stormwater management options shall be considered to comply with this subsection of this chapter: 
i.  Incorporation on the site of best management practices that meet the water quality protection requirements set forth in this subsection. [For the purposes of this subsection, the "site" may include multiple projects or properties that are adjacent to one (1) another or lie within the same HUC where a single best management practice will be utilized by those projects to satisfy water quality protection requirements]; 
ii.  Compliance with a locally adopted regional stormwater management program, which may include a Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permit issued by the department of environmental quality to a local government for its municipally owned separate storm sewer system discharges, that is reviewed and found by the board to achieve water quality protection equivalent to that required by this subsection; and 
iii.  Compliance with a site-specific VPDES permit issued by the department of environmental quality, provided that the local government specifically determines that the permit requires measures that collectively achieve water quality protection equivalent to that required by this subsection. 
2.  Any maintenance, alteration, use or improvement to an existing structure that does not degrade the quality of surface water discharge as determined by the city manager, or designee, may be exempted from the requirements of this subsection. 
Stormwater management criteria for redevelopment shall apply to any redevelopment, whether or not it is located within an intensely developed area designated by the city. 
l.  Where best management practices utilized require regular or periodic maintenance in order to continue their functions such maintenance shall be ensured by a maintenance agreement between the owner or developer and the city or some other effective mechanism that achieves an equivalent objective as determined by the city manager, or designee. 
m.  Flood control and stormwater management facilities that drain or treat water from multiple development projects or from a significant portion of a watershed may be allowed in resource protection areas provided that (1) the city has conclusively established the location of the facility within the resource protection area is the optimum location; (2) the size of the facility is the minimum necessary to provide necessary flood control and stormwater treatment, or both; (3) the facility must be consistent with the design standards contained in the Virginia BMP Clearinghouse or the City of Newport News Design Standards Manual, whichever is more stringent; (4) if all applicable permits for construction in state or federal waters are obtained from the appropriate state and federal agencies; (5) approval must be received from the city manager, or designee, prior to construction and (6) routine inspections and any maintenance required are to be performed on such facilities by the owner to assure that they continue to function as designed and such evidence of inspections and any maintenance is provided to the city manager, or designee, as set forth in sections 37.1-38 and 37.1-39 of this chapter. It is not the intent of this subsection to allow a best management practice that collects and treats runoff from only an individual lot or some portion of the lot to be located within a resource protection area. 
(2)  Resource protection area buffer requirements. Except as hereinafter set forth, the following requirements shall apply within all resource protection areas. Development and redevelopment within industrial waterfront IDAs is exempt from these requirements. 
To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on the other components of resource protection areas, state waters, and aquatic life, it is recognized that a one hundred-foot vegetative buffer area is effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff. A vegetated buffer area not less than one hundred (100) feet in width shall be established where it does not exist and retained where already present. 
The buffer area shall be located adjacent to and landward of all RPA components and along both sides of any water body with perennial flow. The full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the RPA, in accordance with sections 37.1-49, areas of applicability and 37.1-52, plan of development. 
The one hundred-foot buffer area shall be deemed to achieve a seventy-five (75) percent reduction of sediments and a forty (40) percent reduction of nutrients. The buffer area shall be maintained to meet the following additional performance standards: 
a.  In order to maintain the functional value of the buffer area, indigenous vegetation may be removed subject to approval by the city manager, or designee, only to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths, general woodlot management and best management practices, as follows: 
1.  Trees may be pruned or removed as necessary to provide for reasonable sight lines and vistas, provided that where they are removed, they shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff. 
2.  Any path shall be constructed and surfaced so as to effectively control erosion. 
3.  Dead, diseased, or dying trees or shrubbery and noxious weeds may be removed, and thinning of trees allowed pursuant to sound horticultural standard, subject to approval of the city manager, or designee. 
4.  For shoreline erosion control projects, trees and woody vegetation may be removed, necessary control techniques employed, and appropriate vegetation established to protect or stabilize the shoreline in accordance with the best available technical advice and applicable permit conditions or requirements. 
b.  When the application of the buffer areas would result in the loss of a buildable area on a lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989 the city manager, or designee, may allow encroachment into the buffer area in accordance with section 37.1-52, plan of development and the following criteria: 
1.  Encroachments into the buffer area shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utilities. 
2.  Where practicable, a vegetated area that will maximize water quality protection, mitigate the effect of buffer encroachment, and is, equal to the area of encroachment into the buffer area shall be established elsewhere on the lot or parcel. 
3.  The encroachment may not extend into the seaward fifty (50) feet of the buffer area. 
c.  When the application of the buffer area would result in the loss of a buildable area on a lot or parcel recorded between October 1, 1989 and March 1, 2002, encroachments into the buffer area may be allowed through an administrative process in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  The lot or parcel was created as a result of a legal process conducted in conformity with the city's subdivision regulations; 
2.  Conditions or mitigation measures imposed through previously approved exceptions shall be met; 
3.  If the use of a best management practice (BMP) was previously required, the BMP shall be evaluated to determine if it continues to function effectively and, if necessary, the BMP shall be re-established or repaired and maintained as required; and 
4.  The criteria in subdivision (2)b. of this section shall be met. 
(3)  Industrial waterfront intensely developed areas. For the purpose of this article, industrial waterfront IDAs shall serve as redevelopment areas in which development is concentrated. For the purposes of this subsection, development and redevelopment are subject to the same requirements and are collectively referred to as "development." Any development within industrial waterfront IDAs shall require a water quality impact assessment pursuant to section 37.1-52(f). Development within industrial waterfront IDAs shall be subject only to the requirements set forth below. 
a.  For development of land where all stormwater runoff is governed by a site specific Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permit, compliance with the permit shall satisfy the performance standards of this subsection, provided that the city manager, or designee, specifically determines that the permit requires measures that collectively achieve water quality protection equivalent to that provided by this section; provided, further, that all land disturbing activities exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet shall comply with the requirements of article VII of this chapter and the owner obtains a state construction general permit, as required. A copy of such permit shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee. 
b.  For development of land where all stormwater runoff is not governed by a VPDES permit the following performance standards shall apply: 
1.  All development exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of land disturbance shall be subject to a plan of development process in accordance with the provisions of the site plan ordinance. 
2.  All land disturbing activities exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet shall comply with the requirements of article VII of this chapter. 
3.  Where best management practices utilized require regular or periodic maintenance in order to continue their functions, such maintenance shall be ensured by a maintenance agreement between the owner or developer and the city or some other effective mechanism that achieves an equivalent objective as determined by the city manager, or designee, as set forth in section 37.1-39 of this chapter. 
4.  For any development, stormwater runoff shall be controlled to satisfy performance standards contained in section 37.1-35 of this chapter. 
5.  Prior to initiating grading or other land disturbing activities exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet, all wetlands permits required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations shall be obtained and evidence of such submitted to the city manager, or designee. In lieu of the aforesaid permits, the applicant may present a letter from a licensed engineer certifying that in his opinion no such permits are required. A copy of said letter shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee. 
6.  Prior to initiating grading or other land disturbing activities exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet, the owner obtains coverage under and complies with the requirements of a state construction general permit, as applicable. A copy of such permit shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee.

(e)  Erosion and sediment control plan. An erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee, that satisfies the requirements of, and in accordance with, Article VII of this Chapter, in conjunction with site plan or subdivision plan approval. 
(f)  Resource protection area and resource management area water quality impact assessment. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the water quality impact assessment is to: 
a.  Identify the impacts of proposed development or redevelopment on water quality and lands within the resource protection areas and the resource management areas as deemed necessary by the city manager, or designee, due to the unique characteristics of the site or based upon the intensity of development; 
b.  Ensure that, where development does take place within these areas, it will be the least disruptive; 
c.  Provide for administrative relief from the terms of this article when warranted and in accordance with the requirements contained herein; and 
d.  Specify mitigation which will address water quality protection. 
(2)  Water quality impact assessment required. A water quality impact assessment is required for any proposed land disturbances within the resource protection area, including any buffer area encroachment as provided for in section 37.1-51(b)(2), resource protection area buffer requirements. There shall be two (2) levels of water quality impact assessments: a minor assessment and a major assessment. 
(3)  Minor water quality impact assessment. A minor water quality impact assessment pertains only to land disturbance, development or redevelopment within the resource protection area which causes no more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of land disturbance and requires any modification or reduction of the landward fifty (50) feet of the one hundred-foot buffer area. Submission of a plan of development that demonstrates through the use of calculations provided for by section 37.1-52(d)(1)c., that the remaining buffer area and necessary Best Management Practices will result in removal of no less than seventy-five (75) percent of sediments and forty (40) percent of nutrients from post-development stormwater runoff shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirement for a minor water quality impact assessment. Best Management Practices should retard runoff, prevent erosion and filter nonpoint source pollution the equivalent of the full undisturbed one hundred-foot buffer area. 
(4)  Major water quality impact assessment. A major water quality impact assessment shall be required for any land disturbance, development or redevelopment which: (i) exceeds ten thousand (10,000) square feet of land disturbance within a resource protection area or (ii) disturbs any other component of the RPA seaward of the landward fifty (50) feet of the one hundred-foot buffer area. The information required in this section shall be considered a minimum, unless the city manager, or designee, determines that some of the elements are unnecessary due to the scope and nature of the proposed use and development of land. 
a.  A hydrogeological element that: 
1.  Describes the existing topography, soils, hydrology and geology of the site and adjacent lands. 
2.  Describes the impacts of the proposed development on topography, soils, hydrology and geology on the site. 
3.  Describes the proposed mitigation measures for the potential hydrogeological impacts which may include: 
i.  Proposed erosion and sediment controls; including minimizing the extent of the cleared area, and cut and fill, perimeter controls, reduction of runoff velocities, measures to stabilize disturbed areas, schedule and personnel for site inspection; 
ii.  Proposed stormwater management system; 
iii.  Creation of wetlands to replace those lost; and 
iv.  Minimizing cut and fill. 
b.  A landscape element that describes the potential measures for mitigation of the water quality and land impacts including: 
1.  Replanting schedule for trees and other significant vegetation removed for construction; 
2.  Demonstrating that the design of the plan will provide effective erosion control and overland flow benefits from such vegetation; and 
3.  Demonstrating the use of indigenous plants to the greatest extent possible. 
c.  As part of any major water quality impact assessment submittal, the city manager, upon his own review or the recommendation of the designee, may require a review by the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Upon receipt of a major water quality impact assessment, the city manager, upon his own review or the recommendation of the designee, will determine if such review is warranted and may request DEQ to review the assessment and respond with written comments. Any comments by DEQ may be incorporated into the final review by the city manager, or designee, provided that such comments are provided by DEQ within ninety (90) days of the request. 
(5)  Evaluation procedure. 
a.  Upon the completed review of a minor water quality impact assessment, the city manager, or designee, will determine if any proposed modification or reduction to the buffer area is consistent with the provisions of this article and that the following criteria have been satisfied: 
1.  The proposed encroachment is necessary due to the inability to place improvements elsewhere to provide a reasonable and appropriate buildable area on the site; 
2.  Impervious surface is minimized; 
3.  Proposed Best Management Practices, where required, achieve the requisite reductions in pollutant loadings; and 
4.  The development, as proposed, meets the purpose and intent of this article. 
b.  Upon completed review of a major water quality impact assessment, the city manager, or designee, will determine if the proposed development satisfies the following criteria: 
1.  Within any RPA, the proposed development is water-dependent; 
2.  Proposed erosion and sediment control concepts are adequate to achieve the reductions in runoff and prevent off-site sedimentation; 
3.  Proposed stormwater management concepts are adequate to control the stormwater runoff to achieve the required performance standard for pollutant control; 
4.  Proposed re-vegetation of disturbed areas will provide effective erosion and sediment control benefits; and 
5.  The cumulative impact of the proposed development, when considered in relation to other development in the vicinity, will not result in a significant degradation of water quality. 
(g)  Final plan. 
(1)  Final plans for all lands in connection with all development within a resource protection area shall include the following additional information. 
a.  The delineation of the Resource Protection Area ("RPA") boundary and any Resource Management Area ("RMA") boundary. The final plan shall include a note that states that the RPA will be retained as an undisturbed and vegetated one hundred (100) foot buffer not subject to development under this Code section 37.1-51(b)(1), unless the development is a water dependent facility or redevelopment. If the area to be developed has a septic system, or other onsite sewage treatment facility, the final plan shall include a note citing to this Code section 33-91.1, indicating that there is a requirement for pump-out of the system every five (5) years and a one hundred (100) percent reserve drain field sites for onsite sewage treatment systems; 
b.  The delineation of required buffer areas; 
c.  Evidence of all wetlands permits required by law or a letter from a licensed engineer certifying that in his opinion no such permits are required. A copy of said letter shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee; and 
d.  A maintenance agreement as deemed necessary and appropriate by the city manager, or designee, to ensure proper maintenance of Best Management Practices in order to continue their functions shall be submitted to the city manager, or designee, for review and approval. 
(2)  Installation and surety requirements. 
a.  When the occupancy of a structure is desired prior to the completion of the required landscaping, stormwater management facilities, or other specification of an approved plan, a certificate of occupancy may be issued only if the applicant provides to the city manager, or designee, a form of surety satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the remaining plant materials, related materials, and installation costs of the required landscaping or other specifications or maintenance costs for any required stormwater management facilities. 
b.  All required landscaping shall be installed and approved by the first planting season following issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the surety may be forfeited to the City of Newport News. 
c.  All required stormwater management facilities or other specifications shall be installed and approved within eighteen (18) months of project commencement. Should the applicant fail, after proper notice, to initiate, complete or maintain appropriate actions required by the approved plan, the surety may be forfeited to City of Newport News. The City of Newport News may collect from the applicant the amount by which the reasonable cost of required actions exceeds the amount of the surety held. 
d.  After all required actions of the approved plan have been completed, the applicant must submit a written request for a final inspection. If the requirements of the approved plan have been completed to the satisfaction of the city manager, or designee, such unexpended or unobligated portion of the surety held shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated within sixty (60) days following the receipt of the applicant's request for final inspection. The city manager, or designee, may require a certificate of substantial completion from a professional engineer or Class III B Surveyor before making a final inspection. 
(h)  Administrative responsibility. Administration of the plan of development process shall be in accordance with Chapter 33.02, Site Plan Ordinance of the City Code. 
(i)  Denial of plan, appeal of conditions or modifications. 
(1)  In the event the final plan or any component of the plan of development process is disapproved and recommended conditions or modifications are unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant may appeal such administrative decision to the city manager, or designee. Such appeals must be in writing and be filed within ten (10) working days of the decision from which appeal is sought. Prior to granting relief to an application, the city manager must find that the plan is in accordance with all applicable ordinances and includes all necessary elements to mitigate any detrimental impact on water quality. If the city manager finds that the applicant's plan does not meet the above stated criteria, he shall deny the relief sought. 
(2)  If the city manager denies the relief sought as provided herein and the applicant contends such denial was not proper, he may appeal in writing to the circuit court of Newport News, provided that such appeal is filed with the circuit court within sixty (60) days following the date of denial. Such appeal shall be heard by the court, which shall uphold the decision of the city manager unless it finds that appellant has proved by clear and convincing evidence that there exists no rational basis to support the denial.

(1)  At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance to become part of the approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant shall explain the reasons for requesting variances in writing. Specific variances which are allowed by the city manager, or designee, shall be documented in the plan. 
(2)  During construction, the person responsible for implementing the approved plan may request a variance in writing from the city manager, or designee. The city manager, or designee, shall respond in writing either approving or disapproving such a request. If the city manager, or designee, does not approve a variance within ten (10) working days of receipt of the request, the request shall be considered to be disapproved. Following disapproval, the applicant may resubmit a variance request with additional documentation. 
(3)  The city manager, or designee, shall consider variance requests judiciously, keeping in mind both the need of the applicant to maximize cost effectiveness and the need to protect offsite properties and resources from damage.

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to place or have placed or installed on any sidewalk, street, alley or public right-of-way or easement in the city any fence, gate, porch, step, post, barrel, bench, bar, table, box, cart, trailer, vehicle, merchandise, goods, wares or other fixtures or articles whatsoever, whether they be for sale, exhibition or any other purpose. This section shall be subject, however, to exceptions, limitations and provisions set out in this chapter. 
(b)  In addition to any other remedy at law, the city manager or his designee may compel the abatement or removal of all items, fixtures or articles identified in subparagraph (a) herein, and hereinafter referred to as an "obstruction" on a sidewalk, street, alley or public right-of-way or easement. 
(c)  Any person who shall cause or permit the existence of any obstruction governed by this section and not otherwise provided for in the provisions of this Code or other ordinances of the city shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor for each day the obstruction may continue, after due notice shall have been given to remove, correct or abate the same. 
(d)  The city manager or his designee may mail notices of violations of this section to the owner or owners of record of the property at the address maintained by the real estate assessor for the mailing of tax assessments and/or to the occupant or occupants of the property. The notices shall advise the owner or owners or the occupant or occupants of the requirements of this ordinance and that failure to remove, correct or abate the obstruction shall result in the city removing, correcting or abating that obstruction with the person or persons to whom notice was sent being responsible for the costs thereof as provided below. 
(1)  Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any person to whom notice of abatement was given or who is responsible for removing, correcting or abating an obstruction, the city manager or his designee is authorized to have the removal, correction or abatement performed by city forces or by contract. The actual costs of such removal, correction or abatement, plus a charge for administrative costs of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be charged to the person or persons to whom the notice was directed. 
(2)  Whenever the city or its agent has work done pursuant to subsection (1) above, the cost and expenses of such work shall be determined and collected as provided below: 
a.  When the notice required by this section was directed to a person other than the owners of the property, the person to whom the notice was directed shall be billed for the actual costs of such work plus the charge for administrative costs. If such bill is not paid within thirty (30) days, legal action may be instituted for its collection. 
b.  When the notice required by this section was directed to the owner or owners of the property, the city manager or his designee shall certify to the city treasurer the amount of the actual cost of such work, plus the administrative costs; and the city treasurer shall include such total amount in the next regular tax bill for payment, and such amount shall be collected by the treasurer as other taxes and levies are collected. Every charge over two hundred dollars ($200.00) assessed under this section which remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such real property. 
c.  Liens established in accordance with subsection (2)b. shall have the same priority as other unpaid local taxes and shall be enforceable in the same manner as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1, or as those articles are subsequently amended. The city manager may waive such liens in order to facilitate the sale of the property; provided, however, such liens may be waived only as to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and who has not business association with the owner. All such liens shall remain a personal obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were imposed. 
(Ord. No. 268, § 33; Code 1961, § 36-16; Ord. No. 6055-04. § 1)  
Sec. 38-3.1. - Dumpsters on public streets, public rights-of-way and public easements of right-of-way. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in the City Code, it shall be unlawful to place dumpsters, which term includes similar commercial or privately owned containers but not residential-use containers, on a public street or in a public right-of-way or public easement of right-of-way. The term "right-of-way" specifically includes public sidewalks, pedestrian pathways and bicycle paths. 
(b)  Upon proper application by the property owner to the department of engineering, a permit may be issued that authorizes the placement of a dumpster to serve the applicant's property on a public street, public right-of-way and public easement right-of-way, conditioned upon the following criteria: 
(1)  There must be no other practicable location for the dumpster on the applicant's private property as determined by the department of engineering. 
(2)  If determined necessary by the director of engineering or his designee, the applicant shall construct or reconstruct necessary portions of the street, public right-of-way or public easement of right-of-way as required in order to withstand the additional weight and pressure of the dumpster itself and any vehicle that would be used to empty the dumpster. 
(3)  The dumpster shall be placed as determined by the director of engineering or his designee so as to be the last obstructive to the street, public right-of-way or public easement of right-of-way. 
(4)  The applicant shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city and its employees from and against all claims of personal injury, including death, and property damage alleged to have arisen as a result of the placement of the dumpster in the public street, public right-of-way or public easement right-of-way. The applicant shall provide and maintain liability insurance covering the placement of the dumpster in the street, public right-of-way or public easement of right-of-way, which insurance shall include a separate endorsement adding the city as additional insured thereon. The insurance shall be of a "per occurrence" type and shall be in a combined single limit amount of at least three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00). The insurance required by this section shall be approved by the city attorney's office prior to issuance of the relevant permit. 
(c)  Each application for a permit under this section shall be accompanied by the payment of a non-refundable processing fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(d)  Each permit issued pursuant to this section shall expire three (3) years to the day from the date of its issuance unless sooner terminated by the director of engineering or his designee as a result of a violation of the conditions of the permit by the permittee. 
(e)  In the event any of the conditions of the permit are violated, the director of engineering or his designee, in his or her sole discretion, may terminate the permit. In the event the permit is terminated, notice shall be provided the permittee at the address provided on the permit application. Such notice shall be deemed delivered whether by hand or by certified mail and shall direct the permittee to immediately remove the dumpster from the street, public right-of-way or public easement of right-of-way and properly relocate the dumpster. If the dumpster is not removed in accordance with the termination notice, the director of engineering or his designee shall cause the dumpster to be removed and the costs therefor shall be a debt of, charged to and collected from the permittee. 
(Ord. No. 4616-94, § 1)  
Sec. 38-3.2. - Permit for sidewalk use in Hilton Village Historic District commercial area. 
(a)  Permit required. The director of engineering may issue a permit authorizing the use of the special sidewalk easement area within the Hilton Village Historic District commercial area for certain items of street furniture, which is defined as chairs, tables, awnings, umbrellas, planters, and other outdoor furniture related to the operation of a business that is adjacent to the special sidewalk easement. The special sidewalk easement area is that area for which individual property owners granted sidewalk easements to the city, in addition to the right-of-way for Warwick Boulevard which pre-existed those grants. When issuing a permit the director of engineering shall consider the recommendations of the Hilton Village Architectural Review Board. 
(b)  Application; architectural review board recommendation. Persons wishing to place any item(s) of street furniture in the special sidewalk easement area shall make application to the Hilton Village Architectural Review Board prior to requesting a permit from the director of engineering. The board shall review and recommend to the director of engineering the placement, number, character, color, size, decorative features and construction of such street furniture for use in the special sidewalk easement area identified in subsection (a). The board then shall recommend to the director of engineering whether or not a permit should be issued, and under what conditions, if any. 
(c)  Guidelines for street furniture. All items placed in the special sidewalk easement area shall be constructed of materials and have colors appropriate and compatible to the historic district. Tables, benches and chairs shall be made of wood, wrought iron, or other materials determined to be appropriate or compatible by the Hilton Village Architectural Review Board. Awnings and umbrellas shall be made of canvas or other fabric determined to be compatible and appropriate by the board, and shall have a size and color approved by the board. Planters shall be made of terra cotta, concrete, wood or other material determined by the board to be appropriate and compatible to the historic district, and shall have a size and color approved by the board. The items of street furniture listed in Table 1 have been preapproved by the board as to color, size and material. 
The requirements to make application to the Hilton Village Architectural Review Board or to utilize street furniture previously approved by said Board or materials, designs or colors required by this subsection shall not apply to those applicants for a permit authorizing the use of the special sidewalk easement who desire to utilize street furniture that has been used since March 12, 1997. This exception notwithstanding, on and after May 1, 1997, the other requirements of this ordinance must be complied with before the grandfathered street furniture may be used in the special sidewalk easement area. Any street furniture so grandfathered must be maintained in good, safe condition and be serviceable for the purpose for which it was designed; and any street furniture that is removed from use due to wear and tear or its inability to serve the purpose for which it was designed may not be replaced by items of street furniture that do not meet all requirements of this ordinance. 
Items placed in the special sidewalk easement area shall be located in the running bond paver sections of sidewalks adjacent to buildings. Items shall not be placed on the herring bone patterned paver fields or the adjoining soldier course borders. 
(d)  Insurance required. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, the applicant, the street furniture owner, or the property owner shall file with the city attorney evidence of general comprehensive liability insurance insuring against claims, demands or actions arising out of or in connection with the existence of the items to be placed within the special sidewalk easement area. The policy of insurance shall require the insurer to defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and all claims for injury or damage, and shall pay all judgments, costs or expenses which the city may incur or suffer by reason of granting a permit in connection with the erection, alteration, maintenance, repair, removal or existence of such items. Such policy of insurance shall provide liability coverage for bodily injury, death and property damage of not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) combined single limit during any one (1) occurrence for injury to or death of any one (1) or more persons and for property damage or destruction suffered as a result of the existence of such street furniture and shall name the City of Newport News as an additional insured. All such insurance required to be carried by the permit holder shall be with an insurance company licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of Virginia and approved by the Newport News City Attorney's Office. Such insurance (i) shall contain an endorsement that such policy shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding that the insured has released its right of action against any party before the occurrence of a loss; (ii) shall name the City of Newport News as an additional insured party; and (iii) shall provide that the policy shall not be canceled, terminated or materially amended without at least forty-five (45) days' prior written notice [fifteen (15) days if due to nonpayment of premium] to the City of Newport News. Prior to the issuance of the permit, evidence satisfactory to the Newport News City Attorney's Office of the payment of all premiums for such policy, shall be delivered to the Newport News City Attorney's Office for review. As a condition subsequent to the issuance of the permit, the permit holder shall maintain the required insurance at all times during which the permitted item or items are located in the special sidewalk easement area.

(4)  The outdoor dining area may extend into the right of way a maximum of one-half (½) of the sidewalk width from the property line of the permittee, provided that no less than five (5) feet of clear and unobstructed sidewalk width remains for pedestrian use. 
(5)  The director of engineering may reduce the outdoor dining area based upon right of way flow and safety concerns. 
(6)  The outdoor dining area, when not in use, shall be maintained in a useable state and chairs, tables and other appurtenances and dining equipment shall not be stacked or stored outdoors. The outdoor dining area shall not be enclosed. 
(7)  The permittee agrees to maintain in good condition all appurtenances and dining equipment placed in the city right of way or on city property and must protect sidewalk finishes and surfaces from damage. 
(8)  Dining equipment must be located in the public right of way immediately adjacent to the permittee's food and beverage establishment and may not extend beyond the street frontage of same. 
(9)  The applicant shall submit and if a permit is issued shall adhere to an outdoor dining layout identifying the number, type and location of tables, chairs, umbrellas and other dining equipment.

(d)  Insurance required. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, the permittee shall file with the city attorney evidence of general comprehensive liability insurance insuring against claims, demands or actions arising out of or in connection with the existence of the dining equipment to be placed within the outdoor dining area. The policy of insurance shall require the insurer to defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and all claims for injury or damage, and shall pay all judgments, costs or expenses which the city may incur or suffer by reason of granting a permit in connection with the erection, alteration, maintenance, repair, removal or existence of such items. Such policy of insurance shall provide liability coverage for bodily injury, death and property damage of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined single limit during any one (1) occurrence for injury to or death of any one (1) or more persons and for property damage or destruction suffered as a result of the existence of such street furniture and shall name the City of Newport News as an additional insured.

Except as otherwise provided in this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to perform any work in connection with the erection, construction, removal, relocation or maintenance of any surface, overhead or underground installation, or to cut, trim or spray trees, or to place construction signs or materials if such work, cutting, trimming, spraying or placing is on, under, over or in any way affects the surface or subsurface of any street, lane, alley, right-of-way or easement in the city without first having obtained a permit therefor from the director of engineering or the director's authorized representative; nor shall such work be performed after such permit shall have been revoked by the director of engineering or the director's authorized representative, or by the terms of the permit. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful for any person to dig up, break, excavate, tunnel, undermine or in any manner disturb the surface or subsurface of any street, lane, alley, right-of-way or easement in the city without first having obtained a permit therefor from the director of engineering or the director's authorized representative; nor shall such work be performed after such permit shall have been revoked by the director of engineering or the director's authorized representative, or by the terms of the permit. 
The aforementioned permits shall not be required where the work is performed by or on behalf of a subdivision or site developer within his/its approved subdivision or site development, and where the affected surface or subsurface has not yet been accepted by the city; neither shall such permits be required where the work affects only a private street, lane, alley, right-of-way or easement which has not been nor is intended to be dedicated to and/or accepted by the city. However, nothing in this section exempts the requirement of and in fact specifically requires a permit for the installation of driveways, sidewalks or other improvements or structures which are constructed in a subdivision or site development and which are not constructed by or on behalf of the aforementioned developer, even though the affected street, lane, alley, right-of-way or easement may not yet have been accepted by the city. 
If an excavation is required in order to make emergency repairs and the emergency existing requires that excavation operations commence prior to the earliest possible issuance of a permit and within seventy-two (72) hours from the discovery of said emergency, a permit shall not be required to commence said excavation; provided, however, that an application as required by section 38-50 shall be submitted within seventy-two (72) hours after the commencement of said excavation; and provided, further, that notification of such emergency work shall be given by telephone, or other means, to the director of engineering or the director's authorized representative immediately. Such application will be made upon the same form and in the same manner as that required by section 38-50 except that it will specify the emergency condition that existed. Any person commencing an emergency excavation without a permit as allowed herein thereby implies that the person accepts all those conditions and agreements set forth in section 38-50 and elsewhere in this article and that the person will conform to the requirements set forth in sections 38-62 through 38-80.

The land area to be exempted as part of the principal place of residence shall not exceed one (1) acre. 
(b)  The surviving spouse of a veteran eligible for the exemption set forth in this section shall also qualify for the exemption, so long as the death of the veteran occurred on or after January 1, 2011, and the surviving spouse does not remarry.

(c)  The veteran, or surviving spouse, claiming the exemption under this section shall file with the commissioner of the revenue on forms to be supplied by the city, an affidavit or written statement (i) setting forth the name of the disabled veteran, and the name of the spouse, if any, also occupying the real property, (ii) indicating whether the property is jointly owned by a husband and wife, (iii) certifying that the real property is occupied as the veteran's, or surviving spouse's, principal place of residence, and (iv) documentation from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or its successor agency, indicating that the veteran has a one hundred (100) percent service-connected, permanent, and total disability.

(b)  Only those dwellings within the city with assessed values in the most recently ended tax year that are not in excess of the average assessed value for such year of a dwelling situated on property that is zoned as single family residential shall qualify for the exemption under this article. Single family homes, condominiums, town homes, and other types of dwellings of surviving spouses that (i) meet this requirement and (ii) are occupied by such persons as their principal place of residence shall qualify for the real property tax exemption. 
For purposes of determining whether a dwelling is exempt from property taxes, the average assessed value shall be such average for all dwellings located within the city that are situated on property zoned as single family residential. 
(c)  The surviving spouse of a member of the armed forces killed in action shall qualify for the exemption so long as the surviving spouse does not remarry. The exemption applies without any restriction on the spouse's moving to a different principal place of residence. 
(d)  For the purposes of this exemption, real property of any surviving spouse of a member of the armed forces killed in action includes real property (i) held by a surviving spouse as a tenant for life, (ii) held in a revocable inter vivos trust over which the surviving spouse holds the power of revocation, or (iii) held in a irrevocable trust under which the surviving spouse possesses a life estate or enjoys a continuing right of use or support. The term does not include any interest held under a leasehold or term of years. 
(e)  In the event that (i) a surviving spouse is entitled to an exemption under this section by virtue of holding the property in any of the three ways set forth in subsection (d), and (ii) one or more other persons have an ownership interest in the property that permits them to occupy the property, then the tax exemption for the property that otherwise would have been provided shall be prorated by multiplying the amount of the exemption by a fraction that has a numerator the number of surviving spouses who are qualified for the exemption pursuant to this section and has a denominator the total number of people having an ownership interest that permits them to occupy the property. 
In the event that the principal residence is jointly owned by two or more individuals, not all of whom qualify for the exemption, and no person is entitled to the exemption under this section by virtue of holding the property in any of the three ways set forth in subsection (d) then the exemption shall be prorated by multiplying the amount of the exemption by a fraction that has a numerator the percentage of ownership interest in the dwelling held by all such joint owners who qualify for the exemption, and as a denominator, one hundred (100) percent. 
(f)  The surviving spouse claiming the exemption under this section shall file with the commissioner of the revenue, or such other designated officer, on forms to be supplied by the city, an affidavit or written statement (i) setting forth the surviving spouse's name, (ii) indicating any other joint owners of the real property, and (iii) certifying that the real property is occupied as the surviving spouse's principal place of residence. The surviving spouse shall also provide documentation from the United States Department of Defense or its successor agency indicating the date that the member of the armed forces of the United States was killed in action.

Editor's note It should be noted that the amendments of Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1, are applicable to the following program through June 30, 2001. 
State Law reference Authority of city to adopt ordinance similar to this division, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3231. 
 
Sec. 40-34. - Finding of fact. 
The council in 1976 found that the preservation of real estate devoted to agricultural use within the boundaries of the city was in the public interest, and, having heretofore adopted a land-use plan, ordained that such real estate shall be taxed in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia and of this division. 
Despite this plan to promote agricultural use, after a study of this matter the council hereby finds that the number of parcels of land in the city devoted to agricultural use has so diminished that it is no longer in the public interest to continue the taxation of real estate in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of chapter 32 of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia and this division, and as a result of same, such assessment and taxation will cease as of June 30, 2001. 
(Ord. No. 2282, § 16-136; Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1)  
Sec. 40-35. - Application for classification, assessment, etc., generally. 
(a)  For the purpose of assessment and taxation prior to July 1, 2001, the owner of any real estate meeting the criteria set forth in Sections 58.1-3230 and 58.1-3233 of the Code of Virginia may, at least sixty (60) days preceding the tax year for which such taxation is sought, apply to the assessor for the classification, assessment and taxation of such property for the next succeeding tax year on the basis of its use, under the procedures set forth in Section 58.1-3236 of the Code of Virginia. In any year in which a general reassessment is being made, such application may be submitted until thirty (30) days have elapsed after the notice of increase in assessment is mailed. 
(b)  The application provided for in this section shall be on forms provided by the state department of taxation and supplied by the assessor and shall include such additional schedules, photographs and drawings as may be required by the assessor. An individual who is the owner of an undivided interest in a parcel may apply on behalf of himself and the other owners of such parcel upon submitting an affidavit that such other owners are minors or cannot be located. An application shall be submitted whenever the use or acreage of such land previously approved changes; provided, however, that such property owner must re-validate annually with the assessor any applications previously approved. 
(c)  An application fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall accompany each application submitted under this section. A separate application shall be filed for each parcel on the land book. 
(Ord. No. 2282, § 16-137; Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1)  
Sec. 40-36. - Determination of assessor. 
(a)  Promptly upon receipt of any application under this division, the assessor shall determine whether the subject property meets the criteria for taxation hereunder. If the assessor determines that the subject property does meet such criteria, the assessor shall determine the value of such property for its qualifying use, as well as its fair market value. 
(b)  In determining whether the subject property meets the criteria for "agricultural use," the assessor may request an opinion from the state commissioner of agriculture and commerce. Upon the refusal of such commissioner to issue an opinion, or in the event of an unfavorable opinion which does not comport with standards set forth by the commissioner, the party aggrieved may seek relief from any court of record wherein the real estate in question is located. If the court finds in such party's favor, it may issue an order which shall serve in lieu of an opinion for the purposes of this division. 
(Ord. No. 2282, § 16-138; Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1)  
Sec. 40-37. - Land book entries; tax to be extended from use value. 
The use value and fair market value of any property qualifying under this division shall be placed on the land book before delivery to the treasurer and the tax for the next succeeding tax year shall be extended from the use value. 
(Ord. No. 2282, § 16-139; Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1)  
Sec. 40-38. - Change in use or zoning of real estate assessed; roll-back taxes. 
(a)  When real estate qualifies for assessment and taxation prior to July 1, 2001, on the basis of use under this division, and the use by which it qualified changes to a non-qualifying use, or the zoning of the real estate is changed to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent, it shall be subject to additional taxes, hereinafter referred to as roll-back taxes. Such additional taxes shall only be assessed against that portion of such real estate which no longer qualifies for assessment and taxation on the basis of use or zoning. Liability for roll-back taxes shall attach and be paid to the treasurer only if the amount of tax due exceeds ten dollars ($10.00). 
(b)  The roll-back tax shall be equal to the sum of the deferred tax for each of the five (5) most recent complete tax years including simple inter est on such roll-back taxes at the rate prescribed in section 40-28(c) for each of the tax years. The deferred tax for each year shall be equal to the difference between the tax levied and the tax that would have been levied based on the fair market value assessment of the real estate for that year. In addition, the taxes for the current year shall be extended on the basis of fair market value which may be accomplished by means of a supplemental assessment based upon the difference between the use value and the fair market value. 
(c)  Liability to the roll-back taxes shall attach when a change in use occurs, or a change in zoning of the real estate to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent occurs. Liability to the roll-back taxes shall not attach when a change in ownership of the title takes place if the new owner does not re-zone the real estate to a more intensive use and continues the real estate in the use for which it is classified under the conditions prescribed in this division. The owner of any real estate which has been zoned to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent as provided in subsection (d), or otherwise subject to or liable for roll-back taxes, shall, within sixty (60) days following such change in use or zoning, report such change to the real estate assessor on such forms as may be prescribed. The real estate assessor shall forthwith determine and assess the roll-back tax, which shall be assessed against and paid by the owner of the property at the time the change in use which no long qualifies occurs, or at the time of the zoning of the real estate to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent occurs, and shall be paid to the treasurer within thirty (30) days of the assessment. If the amount due is not paid by the due date, the treasurer shall impose a penalty and interest on the amount of the roll-back tax, including interest for prior years. Such penalty and interest shall be imposed in accordance with sections 40-28 (b) and (c). 
(d)  Real property zoned to a more intensive use, at the request of the owner or his agent, shall be subject to and liable for the roll-back tax at the time such zoning is changed. The roll-back tax shall be levied and collected from the owner of the real estate in accordance with subsection (c). Real property zoned to a more intensive use before July 1, 1988, at the request of the owner or his agent, shall be subject to and liable for the roll-back tax at the time of such zoning. Said roll-back tax, plus interest calculated in accordance with subsection (b), shall be levied and collected at the time such property was rezoned. For property rezoned after July 1, 1988, but before July 1, 1992, no penalties or interest, except as provided in subsection (b), shall be assessed, provided the said roll-back tax is paid on or before October 1, 1992. No real property rezoned to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent shall be eligible for taxation and assessment under this article, provided that these provisions shall not be applicable to any rezoning which is required for the establishment, continuation, or expansion of a qualifying use. If the property is subsequently rezoned to agricultural, horticultural, or open space, it shall be eligible for consideration for assessment and taxation under this article only after three (3) years have passed since the rezoning was effective. 
However, the owner of any real property that qualified for assessment and taxation on the basis of use, and whose real property was rezoned to a more intensive use at the owner's request prior to 1980, may be eligible for taxation and assessment under this article provided the owner applies for rezoning to agricultural, horticultural, open-space or forest use. The real property shall be eligible for assessment and taxation on the basis of the qualifying use for the tax year following the effective date of the rezoning. If any such real property is subsequently rezoned to a more intensive use at the owner's request, within five (5) years from the date the property was initially rezoned to a qualifying use under this section, the owner shall be liable for roll-back taxes when the property is rezoned to a more intensive use. Additionally, the owner shall be subject to a penalty equal to fifty (50) percent of the roll-back taxes due as determined under subsection (b) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2282, §§ 16-140, 16-141; Ord. No. 4560-94; Ord. No. 5150-98, § 1; Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1)  
Sec. 40-39. - Misstatements in application filed under division. 
Any person making a material misstatement of fact in any application filed pursuant to this division shall be liable for all taxes, in such amounts and at such times as if such property had been assessed on the basis of fair market value as applied to other real estate in the taxing jurisdiction, together with interest and penalties thereon, and such person shall be further assessed with an additional penalty of one hundred (100) percentum of such unpaid taxes. 
(Ord. No. 2282, § 141; Ord. No. 5591-01, § 1)  
Sec. 40-40. - Application of general tax law. 
The provisions of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia applicable to local levies and real estate assessment and taxation shall be applicable to assessments and taxation under this article mutatis mutandis including, without limitation, provisions relating to tax liens and the correction of erroneous assessments, and for such purposes the roll-back taxes shall be considered to be deferred real estate taxes.

Sec. 40-41. - Transition after discontinuance of agricultural land use assessment program. 
(a)  That on and after July 1, 2001, the benefits derived from the program for the assessment of land devoted to agricultural uses will no longer be available to the owner(s) of that real estate previously afforded such designation through the process found in sections 40-34 through 40-40 of this division. The council adopts the provisions of this section to specify the transition provisions made necessary by its decision to discontinue the agricultural land use assessment program as of June 30, 2001. 
(b)  The "roll-back" tax calculation provisions set forth in Division 2 of this chapter, as adopted and made effective through June 30, 2001, shall remain in force from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2006.

(3)  Real property owned and occupied as the sole dwelling of an eligible person includes real property: 
(i)  Held by the eligible person alone or in conjunction with his spouse as tenant or tenants for life or joint lives; 
(ii)  Held in a revocable inter vivos trust over which the eligible person or the eligible person and his spouse hold the power of revocation; or 
(iii)  Held in an irrevocable trust under which an eligible person alone or in conjunction with his spouse possesses a life estate or an estate for joint lives or enjoys a continuing right of use or support. 
The term "eligible person" does not include any interest held under a leasehold or term of years. 
(4)  Subject to subparagraph (6), of this section, the total combined income received from all sources during the preceding calendar year by: 
(i)  Owners of the dwelling who use it as their principal residence; 
(ii)  Owners' relatives who live in the dwelling, except for those relatives living in the dwelling and providing bona fide caregiving services to the owner whether such relatives are compensated or not; and 
(iii)  Non-relatives of the owner who live in the dwelling, except for bona fide tenants or bona fide caregivers of the owner, whether compensated or not, 
shall not exceed the greater of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), or the income limits based upon family size for the respective metropolitan statistical area, annually published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for qualifying for federal housing assistance pursuant to § 235 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. § 1715z). Any amount up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) of income of each relative who is not the spouse of an owner living in the dwelling and each non-relative who is not the bona fide tenant or bona fide caregiver of an owner living in the dwelling and who does not qualify for the deferral provided by subparagraph (6) hereof is hereby excluded from the total combined income calculation. In addition, ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) of income, from whatever source, shall be excluded from the income of any owner who is permanently disabled. 
(5)  The net combined financial worth, as determined by the city manager, including the present value of all equitable interests, as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, of the owners, and of the spouse of any owner, excluding the value of the dwelling and the land, not exceeding one (1) acre, upon which it is situated shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00).

(6)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (4) of this section, if a person qualifies for a deferral under this article, and if the person can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person's physical or mental health has deteriorated to the point that the only alternative to permanently residing in a hospital, nursing home, convalescent home or other facility for physical or mental care is to have a relative move in and provide care for the person, and if a relative does then move in for that purpose, then none of the income of the relative or of the relative's spouse shall be counted towards the income limit, provided the owner of the residence has not transferred assets in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) without adequate consideration within a three-year period prior to or after the relative moves into such residence.

(c)  A change in ownership of the subject property to a spouse which results solely from the death of the qualifying individual or a sale of such property shall result in a prorated or deferred tax for the then current taxable year if such application for deferral was properly and timely filed and approved. Such prorated portion shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the deferral by a fraction wherein the number of complete months of the year such property was properly eligible for such deferral is the numerator and the number twelve (12) is the denominator.

(b)  Upon a determination that the appeal is frivolous, that collection may be jeopardized by delay, or that suspension of collection would result in substantial economic hardship to the locality, the court may require the taxpayer to pay the amount in dispute or a portion thereof, or to provide surety for payment of the amount in dispute in a form acceptable to the court.

(b)  No suspension of refund activity shall be permitted if the locality's application for judicial review fails to identify with particularity the amount in dispute.

However, any taxpayer who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect. 
(b)  Advisory opinions of the tax commissioner. The tax commissioner shall have the authority to issue advisory written opinions in specific cases as requested to interpret a local business tax and matters related to the administration thereof when an assessment of that tax is subject to appeal to the tax commissioner under this chapter.

All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be open to inspection and examination by the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official in order to allow him to establish whether the tax is due within this jurisdiction. The commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official shall provide the taxpayer with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office, if the records are maintained there. In the event the records are maintained outside this jurisdiction, copies of the appropriate books and records shall be sent to the commissioner's or assessor's office upon demand.

The application shall be before the court when it is filed in the clerk's office. In such proceeding, except as may be provided by section 23-8.3 and section 40-226.6, the burden of proof shall be upon the taxpayer to show that the property in question is valued at more than its fair market value or that the assessment is not uniform in its application, or that the assessment is otherwise invalid or illegal, but it shall not be necessary for the taxpayer to show that intentional, systematic and willful discrimination has been made. The proceedings shall be conducted as an action at law before the court, sitting without a jury. The city attorney shall defend the application. 
(b)  In the event it comes or is brought to the attention of the commissioner of the revenue that the assessment of any tax is improper or is based on obvious error and should be corrected in order that the ends of justice may be served, and he is not able to correct it under this article, the commissioner of the revenue shall apply to the Newport News Circuit Court, in the manner herein provided for relief of the taxpayer. Such application may include a petition for relief for any of several taxpayers.

The following words and phrases, when used in this article, shall, for the purposes of this article, have the following respective meanings, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
(a)  Short-term rental property means all tangible personal property held for rental and owned by a person engaged in the short-term rental business except: 
(1)  Trailers as defined in § 46.2-100, Code of Virginia, 1950 as amended; and 
(2)  Other tangible personal property required to be licensed or registered with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, or the Virginia Department of Aviation. 
(b)  Engaged in the short-term rental business. A person is engaged in the short-term rental business if: 
(1)  Not less than eighty (80) percent of the gross rental receipts of such business during the preceding year arose from transactions involving the rental of short-term rental property, other than heavy equipment property as defined in subdivision (2), for periods of ninety-two (92) consecutive days or less, including all extensions and renewals to the same person or a person affiliated with the lessee; or 
(2)  Not less than sixty (60) percent of the gross rental receipts of such business during the preceding year arose from transactions involving the rental of heavy equipment property for periods of two hundred seventy (270) consecutive days or less, including all extensions and renewals to the same person or a person affiliated with the lessee. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term "heavy equipment property" means rental property of an industry that is described under code 532412 or 532490 of the 2002 North American Industry Classification System as published by the United States Census Bureau, excluding office furniture, office equipment, and programmable computer equipment and peripherals as defined in § 58.1-3503 A 16 of the Code of Virginia. 
(c)  For purposes of determining whether a person is engaged in the short-term rental business as defined above, (i) a person is "affiliated" with the lessee of rental property if such person is an officer, director, partner, member, shareholder, parent or subsidiary of the lessee, or if such person and the lessee have any common ownership interest in excess of five (5) percent, (ii) any rental to a person affiliated with the lessee shall be treated as rental receipts but shall not qualify for purposes of the eighty (80) percent requirement of subdivision (1) or the sixty (60) percent requirement of subdivision (2), and (iii) any rental of personal property which also involves the provision of personal services for the operation of the personal property rented shall not be treated as gross receipts from rental, provided, however, that the delivery and installation of tangible personal property shall not mean operation for purposes of this section. 
(Ord. No. 3887-89, § 1; Ord. No. 6611-09, § 1)  
Sec. 40-246. - Levied; amount. 
There is hereby imposed and levied a tax upon short-term rental property in an amount of one (1) percent of the gross proceeds of any person engaged in the short-term rental business. Gross proceeds shall mean the total amount charged to each person for the rental of short-term rental property, excluding any state and local sales tax paid under the provisions of Chapter 6 of Title 58.1, Taxation, of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.

(Ord. No. 3887-89, § 1; Ord. No. 6611-09, § 1)  
Sec. 40-247. - Collection of tax. 
(a)  Any person engaged in the short-term rental business shall collect the rental tax from the lessee of the short-term rental property at the time of the rental. The lessor of the short-term rental property shall transmit a quarterly return to the commissioner of the revenue indicating the gross, not later than the fifteenth day following the end of each calendar quarter, reporting the gross rental proceeds derived from the short-term rental business. The commissioner of the revenue shall assess the tax due, and the commissioner of the revenue shall collect the daily rental property tax pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The short-term rental business shall pay the tax so assessed not later than the last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, no tax shall be collected or assessed on: (1) rentals by the Commonwealth, any political subdivision of the Commonwealth or the United States; or (2) any rental of durable medical equipment as defined in Subdivision 10 of § 58.1-609.10 of the Code. 
(c)  The commissioner of the revenue shall receive taxes in the following manner: 
(1)  Commissioner of the revenue to receive taxes. The commissioner of the revenue of the City of Newport News shall collect the daily rental property taxes and continue to collect the amount due and payable for the quarterly payments, up to and including the due date, without penalty or interest thereon. 
(2)  Failure to file return or remit payments; fraudulent return; civil penalties. Any person failing to remit the payments of daily rental property taxes on or before the due dates shall incur a penalty thereon of six (6) percent if the failure is for not more than one (1) month, with an additional six (6) percent for each additional month, or fraction thereof, during which the failure continues, not to exceed thirty (30) percent in the aggregate. In no case, however, shall the penalty be less than ten dollars ($10.00) and such minimum penalty shall apply whether or not any tax is due for the period for which such return was required. If such failure is due to providential or other good cause shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner of the revenue, such return with or without remittance may be accepted exclusive of penalties. In the case of a false or fraudulent return where willful intent exists to defraud the city of any tax due under this article, or in the case of a willful failure to file a return with the intent to defraud the city of any such tax, a specific penalty of fifty (50) percent of the amount of the proper tax shall be assessed. All penalties and interest imposed by this article shall be payable by the lessor and collectible by the commissioner of the revenue in the same manner as if they were a part of the tax imposed. 
(3)  Interest on taxes and penalties not paid when due. Interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum shall be computed and collected from the lessor upon the taxes and penalty from the date such taxes and/or penalty were due.

(f)  In the event that the commissioner of the revenue makes a written determination that a rental business previously certified as a short-term rental business has failed to meet either of the tests set forth in section 40-245(b) during a preceding tax year, such business shall lose its certification as a short-term rental business and shall be subject to the business personal property tax with respect to all rental property for the tax year in which such certification is lost and any subsequent tax years until such time as the rental business obtains recertification. In the event that a rental business loses its certification as a short-term rental business pursuant to this subsection, such business shall not be required to refund to customers daily rental property taxes previously collected in good faith and shall not be subject to assessment for business personal property taxes with respect to rental property for tax years preceding the tax year in which the certification is lost unless the commissioner of the revenue makes a written determination that the business obtained its certification by knowingly making materially false statements in its application, in which case the commissioner may assess the taxpayer the amount of the difference between short-term rental property taxes remitted by such business during the period in which the taxpayer wrongfully held certification and the business personal property taxes that would have been due during such period but for the certification obtained by the making of the materially false statements. Any such assessment, and any determination not to certify or to decertify a rental business as a short-term rental business as defined in this section may be appealed pursuant to the procedures and requirements set forth in § 58.1-3983.1 of the Code of Virginia for appeals of local business taxes. 
(g)  A rental business that has been decertified pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) shall be eligible for recertification for a subsequent tax year upon a showing that it met one (1) of the tests provided in section 40-245(b) for at least ten (10) months of operations during the present tax year.

Sec. 42-23. - Waterworks system capacity expansion. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. To finance growth-related capacity expansion and improvement of the waterworks system, a system development fee is imposed for each new connection made to the waterworks system. 
(b)  System development fee. 
(1)  Effective July 1, 2016, the system development fee for a ?? meter will be $2,520.00. 
(2)  The system development fee shall be based on the size of the meter to be installed and the meter's capacity to withdraw water from the distribution system. The system development fee will be set for a ?? meter. Effective July 1, 2006, for all meters above ??, the system development fee will be based on their capacity ratio relative to the ?? meter as provided in the table below: 
  Capacity Ratio Table

10 	346.7 
 
(3)  When the size of the meter serving any premises is increased, the developer, applicant or owner requesting the increase shall pay a fee equal to the difference between the current system development fee for the existing meter capacity and the current system development fee for the larger capacity meter to be installed. 
(4)  When the capacity of any meter serving any premises is to be decreased, no system development fee nor capacity credit applies. 
(5)  When a new water service is requested where previous service existed, the developer, applicant or owner will receive system development fee credit for the capacity of the previous service equal to the current system development fee for that service capacity regardless whether a system development fee was paid for the previous service. Evidence of prior service is the responsibility of the developer, applicant or owner and is subject to approval by the director. 
(6)  When a larger meter is requested by the developer, applicant or owner in order to provide greater water flow for fire protection or fire fighting purposes through fire sprinkler systems or fire hydrants, and for related testing, and such arrangement is approved by the fire department in the jurisdiction where water service will be provided, the system development fee will be calculated based upon the size of the meter needed to provide water service excluding the incremental increase in the meter for fire protection, fire fighting, and testing purposes in accordance with departmental policy. 
(7)  The system development fee payment shall be made prior to meter installation. 
(8)  The system development fee imposed by this section shall be in addition to all other fees for water service imposed under this chapter. 
(c)  System development fee funds. All funds received in payment of the system development fee imposed under this section shall be used to finance growth-related capacity expansion and improvement of the waterworks system, including the payment of debt service on bonds issued to expand and improve the waterworks system.

(a)  Purpose and intent. Extensions of the waterworks distribution system shall be provided under an extension agreement in accordance with applicable departmental policies for (1) individual water service installation; (2) extension of water pipelines; and (3) adjustment of water pipelines. 
(b)  Extension agreements. 
(1)  The director is authorized to approve, execute, and modify agreements for the extension of water services on behalf of the city, provided that the form of the agreement is approved by the city attorney. 
(2)  Each agreement shall require payment by the developer, applicant or owner of the total cost of the extension, to include pipeline, water meters, water services, connection fees, fire protection, inspection, and any other applicable fees and charges. 
(3)  Plans for distribution system extension shall be submitted to the department for approval and shall meet: 
i.  The criteria of the currently approved design and distribution standards. 
ii.  Fire protection standards as required by the appropriate fire official of the jurisdiction in which the development or service is located. 
(4)  No water services shall be installed until an agreement has been executed and fees have been paid, and the developer, applicant or owner has designated a proper location for each water service. Water services may only be installed by the city, or a contractor certified by the director in conjunction with an agreement. Meter installation shall be approved and controlled by the city. 
(5)  All necessary easements and licenses shall be furnished without cost to the city. Any cost for maintaining such easements and licenses shall be the responsibility of the developer, applicant or owner. 
(6)  Title to the water pipeline and its appurtenances shall vest in the "City of Newport News" upon completion of the requirements in each agreement. The city shall have the right to make or permit additional extensions, adjustments and connection to all extensions and adjustments after their completion. 
(7)  Fees shall be forfeited and the agreement shall be void if water services or meters are not installed within three (3) years from the date of the agreement. Thereafter, the installation of water services and meters shall require payment of current fees and the completion of a new extension agreement. 
(c)  Betterment. If the waterworks system requires either a pipeline larger than that required to serve the needs of the proposed project, or additional pipeline installation to improve the regional distribution system, the city shall pay the betterment cost, which is the incremental increase in the cost of the improvements beyond those necessary for the developer's, applicant's or owner's project.

(a)  The director shall inspect all buildings or premises during reasonable hours and under such circumstances as to minimize the inconvenience to the owner of the building or premises. Should any owner or agent refuse to allow the director access to the building or premises for the purposes of conducting an inspection, or should the director not be able to contact the owner or agent for the purposes of obtaining permission to inspect, the director shall have the right to apply immediately to a magistrate or other judicial officer for a proper warrant to carry out the necessary inspection. The provisions of this section shall apply to all initial inspections and to such follow-up inspections as may be necessary. 
(b)  In addition to the warrant procedure set forth in subsection (a), the director may commence administrative proceedings to discontinue water service to the uninspected building or premises. Except in emergency cases involving the imminent risk of pollution of the city water supply, the director shall give ten (10) days written notice to the owner of the affected building or premises, or to a responsible agent, of the director's intention to terminate the water service. The director shall afford to the owner or agent a hearing on the question of whether water service shall be terminated. This hearing shall be scheduled and conducted in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible, the inconvenience and burden on the owner or agent shall be minimized. The hearing shall take place before the director. The director shall not terminate the water service to the building or premises in question, if it is found as a fact that: 
(1)  The owner or agent has presented clear, convincing and credible evidence that there are no cross connection hazards within the subject building or premises; and 
(2)  No purpose of this article would be served by conducting an on-site inspection of the building or premises. 
In all cases, the hearing provided by this subsection shall be held within the ten-day period immediately following the giving of written notice to the owner or agent. Upon a showing of good cause, the director may grant a reasonable continuance of the hearing so scheduled, but the director, nevertheless, shall retain the right to terminate the water service at the expiration of the ten-day notice period if, in his discretion, public health considerations require such action. The director shall, in all cases, render his decision immediately after the taking of all evidence at the hearing, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, but in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours following the termination of the taking of evidence. The director shall cause his findings of fact and disposition of the case to be reduced to writing. 
(c)  In emergency circumstances where the director has reasonable cause to believe that a cross connection hazard exists in the subject building or premises and that such hazard jeopardizes the integrity or the purity of the city water supply, he shall forthwith terminate the water service to the subject building or premises. The director shall thereafter immediately afford the owner or agent the notice and opportunity to be heard pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (b). In all cases where the director shall summarily terminate water service as provided under this subsection, the director shall act with dispatch in notifying the owner or agent and shall exercise the utmost diligence in scheduling a prompt hearing on the matter. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), the director shall not terminate any water service in cases where the director has reliable information from any sources indicating that cross connection hazards do not exist in the building or premises to which access for inspection cannot be gained.

(Ord. No. 6233-06, § 1)  
Sec. 42-81. - Requirements for development. 
(a)  Runoff control permit. Except as herein expressly provided, it shall be illegal to engage in any development otherwise permitted by law in the watershed of any reservoir until a runoff control permit is issued by the city's runoff control official. It shall thereafter be illegal for anyone to willfully fail to conform to the provisions of said permit in carrying out such development or in operating and maintaining the activities or improvements so developed. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the approval of any subdivision plat where no physical development is to be carried out within any watershed. 
(1)  Any person applying for a runoff control permit shall submit an application to the runoff control official that includes a runoff control plan prepared by a registered professional engineer with specifications for the temporary and permanent control of surface water runoff sufficient in detail to meet the requirements of this article regarding the quantity and quality of surface runoff. If the runoff control official determines that the natural drainage system is sufficient to contain and decontaminate the runoff created by the development, and that the drainage system is under the control of the applicant and unavailable for future development, a permit may be granted without a specific runoff control plan or further review by staff. 
(2)  The runoff control official shall review the plans and specifications to ensure that the quality and quantity of surface water runoff will not be detrimental to the water quality of the reservoir. Plans should provide for a diversion/retention system that is equal to or more effective than wet ponds (outlined in the Design Criteria Manual) in containing and removing potential pollutants. Plans should also provide for the complete containment of a spill of any materials stored on the property and long-term maintenance of the system. 
(3)  In the event that the runoff control official shall determine that the plans and specifications are insufficient in any respect, the runoff control official shall promptly notify the applicant to correct the deficiencies. In addition, the runoff control official may require the submission of such additional data as may be reasonably necessary to carry out a thorough review of the application. 
(4)  In the event that the plans and specifications submitted are found to be adequate, the runoff control official may require, prior to issuing a permit, a bond with surety or other security satisfactory to the runoff control official sufficient for and conditioned upon completion of the controls specified in such plans and specifications, in the manner and within the time prescribed in such permit. 
(5)  Failure of the city to act on any permit application within sixty (60) days after all the necessary information has been properly filed with the runoff control official shall constitute approval of the application. The city shall be deemed to have acted whenever written notice of conditional approval, rejection or modification shall have been mailed by the runoff control official to the applicant at the address shown on the application. 
(6)  In the event of any change in any plan for development, the developer shall submit to the runoff control official any additional data, plans and specifications as may be reasonably necessary to ensure the control of the quantity and quality of any additional surface water runoff occasioned by such change. The procedure for submission of such additional data shall conform to the original application procedure. 
(7)  Whenever any development is proposed to be carried out by any person, other than the owner of the land, the responsibility for complying with this article and with all conditions imposed pursuant hereto, including, but not limited to, the maintenance, repair and replacement of any temporary or permanent runoff control measure, shall remain on the property owner. 
(8)  In the event that a developer wishes to utilize a city-owned and maintained diversion/retention system to ensure that the quality and quantity of surface water runoff will not be detrimental to the water quality of the reservoir, the developer shall submit such request to the runoff control official with plans, specifications and calculations of sufficient detail for the runoff control official to determine if this is a feasible option. The runoff control official will approve or deny the request. Should approval be granted, the developer shall be responsible for a pro rata share of design, construction, maintenance costs and any required bond with surety or other security required by city, and shall enter into an agreement with the city for use of the diversion/retention system consistent with the department's best management practice cost sharing policy. 
(b)  Exceptions to permit requirements. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, no runoff control permit shall be required for any of the following activities: 
(1)  The installation, repair, replacement, enlargement or modification of any water supply intended to serve a total of not more than two (2) dwelling units; and 
(2)  The interior repair, remodeling or reconstruction of any existing structure. 
(c)  Existing uses. Any exterior modification to a use whether renovation, expansion or reconstruction, which results in an increase in impervious surface, requires a runoff control permit. 
(d)  Septic tanks and drain fields. Notwithstanding the city council's long-term goal to prohibit the installation of new septic tanks and drainage fields in the reservoir protection area, the council nevertheless promulgates the following regulations to permit such new installations in the reservoir protection area in accordance with the conditions prescribed below: 
(1)  New septic tanks and drainage fields may be installed in acreage or lots of record existing prior to September 13, 1988; provided that in no case shall such installation require use of the buffer zone described in paragraph (f) below; and provided further that the required health department approval is first obtained. 
(2)  From and after September 13, 1988, septic tanks and drainage fields may be installed in lots of newly created subdivisions provided that such lots are one (1) acre or larger in size; provided that in no case shall such installation require use of the buffer zone described in paragraph (f) below; and provided further that the required health department approval is first obtained. 
(3)  Properties in which septic systems are installed pursuant to this section must connect to the Newport News public sewer system when such public system is reasonably available. For the purposes of this section, the term "reasonably available" shall mean that a public sewer line to which connections are permitted is within one hundred (100) feet in length in a straight line or one hundred twenty-five (125) feet in length if a connection must be installed which circumvents an obstacle of a permanent nature. The distances are measured from the property line closest to the public sewer line to the public sewer line. 
(e)  Prohibited uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(1) and (2) hereof, it shall be illegal to do the following activities unless the activity is accessory to a utility and it can be proven to the satisfaction of the runoff control official that adequate measures can be taken to achieve the same degree of water quality with the acceptable best management practices (outlined in the Design Criteria Manual): 
(1)  Activities involving the manufacture, bulk storage, or any type of distribution of petroleum, chemical, asphalt products, or any hazardous substances as defined in Section 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and substances designated under section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act (Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, as amended in 1977). 
(2)  Installing a new septic tank and drain field unless otherwise permitted by this article. This does not preclude the maintenance of existing septic tanks or drain fields. 
(f)  Buffer zones. It shall be illegal for any permitted development to occur within two hundred (200) horizontal feet from the center of any perennial stream or from the edge of any city reservoir and within one hundred (100) horizontal feet from the center of any intermittent stream. Crossing of perennial or intermittent streams, by roads, utilities and the like should be limited to the least impactive portion of the stream as verified by the department. Where such crossings are necessary for the development of the site and required by other city regulations, the standards for construction as outlined in the Design Criteria Manual shall apply. 
(g)  Waiver option. The buffer requirement may be reduced to no less than fifty (50) feet when it can be proven to the satisfaction of the runoff control official that the reduction would achieve the same degree of water quality with acceptable best management practices (outlined in the Design Criteria Manual) as with the two hundred- or one hundred-foot buffer. If it is determined a significant hardship exists after the maximum allowable waiver is granted, then the runoff control official may grant, after consultation with the director, an additional parcel waiver. This waiver will only be granted in the case of a proven hardship and would allow single-family development (one detached single-family structure with such accessory structures as are permitted in the city's zoning ordinance) on one-acre minimum lots or lots of record when parcel size is less than one (1) acre and would allow a buffer reduction to a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. A detail of an acceptable best management practice appears in the Design Criteria Manual. 
Under no circumstances will the following uses be permitted within either buffer area: 
(1)  Septic tanks and drain fields. 
(2)  Trash containers and dumpsters.

(a)  The board chairman may require a permittee to implement monitoring and reporting procedures they believe are reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the permit and this chapter. 
(b)  The board chairman may require such on-site inspections as he believes are reasonably necessary to determine whether the measures required by the permit are being properly performed, or whether the provisions of this chapter are being violated. Prior to conducting any inspection, the board chairman shall provide notice to the resident owner, occupier, or operator, who shall be given an opportunity to accompany the site inspector. If it is determined that there is a failure to comply with the permit, the board chairman shall serve notice upon the permittee at the address specified in his permit application or by delivery at the site of the permitted activities to the person supervising those activities and designated in the permit to receive the notice. The notice shall describe the measures needed for compliance and the time within which these measures shall be completed.

(c)  Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from the designated enforcement officer, the board chairman may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in subsection (b) of this section, issue an order requiring all or part of the activities on the site to be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken. In the case of an activity not authorized under this chapter or where the alleged permit noncompliance is causing, or is in imminent danger of causing, significant harm to the wetlands protected by this chapter, the order may be issued without regard to whether the person has been issued a notice to comply pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Otherwise, the order may be issued only after the permittee has failed to comply with the notice to comply. The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven (7) days from the date of service pending application by the enforcing authority, permittee, resident owner, occupier, or operator for appropriate relief to the circuit court of the jurisdiction where the violation was alleged to have occurred. Upon completion of corrective action, the order shall immediately be lifted. Nothing in this section shall prevent the board chairman from taking any other action specified in section 44-17. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from a designated enforcement officer, the wetlands board may order that the affected site be restored to predevelopment conditions if the board finds that restoration is necessary to recover lost resources or to prevent further damage to resources. The order shall specify the restoration necessary and establish a reasonable time for its completion. The order shall be issued only after a hearing with at least thirty (30) days' notice to the affected person of the hearing's time, place, and purpose, and shall become effective immediately upon issuance by the board. The board shall require any scientific monitoring plan they believe necessary to ensure the successful reestablishment of wetlands protected by this chapter and may require that a prepaid contract acceptable to the board be in effect for the purpose of carrying out the scientific monitoring plan. The board may also require a reasonable bond or letter of credit in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it securing to the commonwealth compliance with the conditions set forth in the restoration order. The appropriate court, upon petition by the board, may enforce any such restoration order by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy. Failure to complete the required restoration is a violation of this chapter. 
(e)  The duties of the board chairman under this section may be delegated to a designee; however, this designee shall not be a designated enforcement officer. 
(Ord. No. 4428-93, § 1)  
Sec. 44-19. - Violation of orders, rules and regulations.

Following a conviction, every day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 4428-93, § 1)

Upon petition of the wetlands board to the circuit court of the city, when any act is done or threatened which is unlawful under this chapter, the court may enjoin the unlawful act and order the defendant to take any steps necessary to restore, protect and preserve the wetlands involved. This remedy shall be exclusive of and in addition to any criminal penalty which may be imposed under section 44-18. 
(Ord. No. 4428-93, § 1)  
Sec. 44-21. - Local credit for in-lieu fees.

AnnotationIn the case of Segaloff v. City of Newport News, 163 SE 2d 135 (Va. SCA, 1968), it was held that a canopy extending over a parking area was within the meaning of "structure" under a former zoning ordinance and that, since the canopy violated the setback requirements of that ordinance, the city could withdraw a building permit previously issued and force removal of that part of the canopy within the required setback area. Issuance of the building permit did not amend the requirements of the ordinance.

Sec. 45-524. - Adult uses. 
(a)  Within the city, it is acknowledged that there are some uses, often referred to as adult uses, which because of their nature can have a negative impact on nearby property, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to a residential neighborhood, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods. These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing the concentration or location of these uses in a manner that would create such adverse effects. The definition of adult uses is found in section 45-201 of this chapter. 
(b)  No adult use shall be permitted except in, C1, C2, and C3 districts. A conditional use permit, as provided for in Article XXVII of this chapter, is necessary for the establishment of an adult use. A conditional use permit may be issued by the city council after recommendation by the planning commission and finding that the location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed adult use will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to neighboring uses. 
(c)  No unit containing an adult use in the C1, C2 or C3 districts shall be located nearer than five hundred (500) feet to: 
(1)  Any school, church, park, playground or a library property; 
(2)  Any other adult use; 
(3)  Any residentially zoned property which fronts on the same street or which contains any school, church, park, playground or library; otherwise, the minimum distance from such unit to a residential zone shall be two hundred (200) feet.

ARTICLE XXVII. - CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS 
 
Sec. 45-2701. - Purpose and intent. 
Within zoning districts, certain uses are of a nature requiring special review to determine whether they should be permitted in specified locations because of their impact on surrounding areas. Special conditions and safeguards may be applied if permission is granted in such locations. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2702. - Generally. 
The city council may authorize, by issuance of a conditional use permit, the use of land in a district in accordance with article IV, section 45-402, summary of uses by district, and may specify special conditions and safeguards governing the use authorized. 
A conditional use permit shall be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  That the specific use will be compatible with and not injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property, nor significantly diminish or impair property values within the immediate vicinity; 
(2)  That the establishment of the specific use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding vacant property; 
(3)  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary supporting facilities have been or will be provided; 
(4)  That the design, location and arrangement of all driveways and parking spaces provide for the safe and convenient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic without adversely affecting the general public or adjacent developments; 
(5)  That adequate nuisance prevention measures have been or will be taken to prevent or control offensive odor, fumes, dust, noise and vibration; 
(6)  That directional lighting is provided so as not to disturb or adversely affect neighboring properties; 
(7)  That there are sufficient landscaping and screening to insure harmony and compatibility with adjacent property; 
(8)  That the proposed use is in accordance with the comprehensive plan. 
The city council will not consider applications for uses which would be permitted as special exceptions in article XXXII. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2703. - Application requirements.

(3)  Such applications shall completely disclose the equitable ownership of the real estate to be affected including, in the case of corporate ownership, the names of stockholders, officers and directors and in any case the names and addresses of all of the real parties of interest. However, the requirement of listing names of stockholders, officers and directors shall not apply to a corporation whose stock is traded on a national or local stock exchange and having more than five hundred (500) shareholders. In the case of a condominium, the requirement shall apply only to the title owner, contract purchaser, or lessee if they own ten (10) percent or more of the units in the condominium. 
(4)  The application shall be accompanied by: 
a.  A written description of the nature and extent of the specific use for which a conditional use permit is being requested and a written explanation of how the conditions of section 45-2702 have been satisfied in order to warrant approval of the requested permit.

c.  Ten (10) copies and one (1) eight and one-half (8½) inch by eleven (11) inch reproducible copy of a site plan including a drawing or drawings of the proposed conditional use; such drawing shall be drawn to scale and in such manner as to show clearly the following information: 
1.  The actual dimensions and shape of the property; 
2.  The exact size and location on the property of existing and proposed structures; 
3.  The existing and proposed uses of all structures and open areas; 
4.  The name of the owner, as well as the name of any other person preparing the plan, together with the north point, scale and number of sheets of the plan;

Prior to actions by the planning commission, review of said application shall be made to determine the possible impact of the proposal on the surrounding community and the administrative and enforcement aspects of the permit. The director of planning and development shall develop such report in coordination with appropriate city departments. When the parcel under consideration drains into any of the city's reservoirs, a recommendation from the director of waterworks shall be solicited and included as part of the planning and development director's report. 
(b)  Action by city planning commission. Following public notice as required by the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for a use permit. Following such hearing, the commission shall prepare a report indicating its recommendation as to whether the use permit should be granted and as to conditions and safeguards, if any, which should be required in the particular case, based upon findings as to conformity with the general standards set forth in section 45-2702 above. Such recommendations shall be transmitted to the city council. 
(c)  Review by Hilton Village Architectural Review Board. Whenever an application for a conditional use permit is made for any property within the Hilton Village Historic District, as defined in article XXXI, the planning and development or zoning departments shall refer such applications to the Hilton Village Architectural Review Board for review and recommendation prior to making a recommendation to the city council on such application. The architectural review board shall make its report to the planning commission within thirty (30) days after the date the application was referred to the board. 
(d)  Action by city council. After receiving the recommendation of the planning commission, and following public notice as provided by law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the city council shall hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional use permit. Following such hearing, the city council shall grant or deny the application for the conditional use permit with conditions and safeguards as recommended by the planning commission or with such appropriate modification of such conditions and safeguards.

The occupant of a parcel of land may, in addition to any uses permitted by right for the zoning district as specified in Article IV, section 45-402, engage in the use for which he has obtained a conditional use permit, as long as the conditions attached thereto are complied with. All other regulations of the zoning district in which the use is located shall apply and remain in force unless modified by the conditional use permit. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1; Ord. No. 5233-98)  
Sec. 45-2708. - Time limit. 
Conditional use permits granted by the city council shall be deemed to have been abandoned and are hereby revoked twenty-four (24) months from the date the permit was approved in the event the construction or occupancy necessary to the use for which the permit was granted has not been commenced, unless extended by the city council. The commencement of construction shall be considered as the completing of any necessary foundation work. In addition, conditional use permits granted by city council shall be deemed to have been abandoned and are hereby revoked after twenty-four (24) months of continuous nonuse of the property for the use for which the permit was granted, or after the expiration of a time limit attached as a condition of the use, unless extended by the city council. For good cause shown, the city council may grant an extension of the conditional use permit for a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months. The city council may grant an additional extension; provided, however, that any request for such additional extension shall first be referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendations. A request for such an extension shall be made in writing, by the property owner or his duly authorized agent, and filed with the director of planning and development at least forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration date of the permit or extension. If a conditional use permit is abandoned and revoked, then all regulations and uses of the zoning district in which the use was located shall apply.

The fee shall not be required for an administrative deferral. 
(b)  Withdrawal of an application. An application for a conditional use permit may be withdrawn by the applicant prior to a public hearing; provided such request is filed by 5:00 p.m. on the Thursday prior to the public hearing; however; any resubmittal shall be deemed a new application.

ARTICLE XXVIII. - MODIFICATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 45-2801. - Purpose of article. 
The requirements set forth in this article modify, supplement or qualify the district regulations which appear elsewhere in this chapter, and shall apply in the specific areas enumerated. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2802. - Modifications to yard regulations. 
(a)  General modifications. 
(1)  Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky, unobstructed by a building, structure or use except for: 
a.  Accessory buildings permitted in accordance with this ordinance; 
b.  The ordinary projection, not to exceed three (3) feet, of sills, belt courses, chimneys, pilasters, cornices and ornamental features; provided, such projections are not closer than three (3) feet from any lot line where a yard is required in this ordinance; and 
c.  Off-street parking spaces in a front, side or rear yard; provided, that no space within a clear-sight triangle composed of two (2) twenty-foot legs of the property lines abutting intersecting streets shall be occupied by off-street parking spaces. 
(2)  Terraces, steps, decks, and uncovered porches may project into the required side or rear yard not more than five (5) feet; provided, they do not come closer than three (3) feet to the side property line nor closer than fifteen (15) feet to the rear property line. 
(3)  Open fire escapes and mechanical equipment may project into a required side or rear yard; provided, that they be located not closer than three (3) feet to any side or rear property line. 
(b)  Front yard modifications. The front yard regulations shall be adjusted in applicable cases as follows: 
(1)  Where existing buildings occupy lots comprising fifty (50) percent of the block, the average setback of the existing buildings shall be taken in lieu of the front yard otherwise required. After a block is fifty (50) percent developed and the average setback of the existing buildings has been determined, such average shall not be reduced by the erection of new buildings and enclosed additions on the front of existing buildings in such block. 
(2)  In cases of double frontage lots, front yards shall be provided along each street frontage. 
(3)  Chimneys, unenclosed covered and uncovered stoops and porches, decks or other unenclosed projections may project no more than eight (8) feet into any front yard; provided, that no such projection may be nearer than fifteen (15) feet to the front property line. 
(4)  On corner lots where both intersecting streets are designated either as major or secondary thoroughfares on the Transportation Plan, the setback for major thoroughfares shall apply to both the front and the side yards abutting such streets; provided, however, that the buildable width of a nonconforming lot of record shall not be required to be less than forty (40) feet. 
(5)  Special setbacks shall be provided along all streets classified as major thoroughfares in conformity with section 45-2808 of this article. 
(6)  Gasoline supply station pumps and pump islands, including accompanying unenclosed canopies, may be located within a front yard in the C3 or in any M district; provided they are located not less than fifteen (15) feet from the property line; and in no district shall these accessory uses be located less than fifty (50) feet from the boundary line of any residential district. 
(c)  Lot or site width front, setback modifications. The required lot width shall be established at the recorded front yard setback line. The front yard setback line may be recorded at a distance no greater than ten (10) feet farther from the front lot line than the minimum front yard set back required by this ordinance. 
(d)  Rear yard modifications. Where the rear line of a lot abuts an alley, up to one-half (½) of the width of such alley may be counted toward the required rear yard, but in no case shall the required rear yard be reduced to less than five (5) feet. 
(e)  Transitional buffer area required between zoning districts of different intensity. 
(1)  A special transitional buffer area shall be required in any zoning district when that zoning district abuts a lower intensity zoning district and shall be measured from the zoning district line to produce a transitional buffer area with the minimum width indicated by the following table 28-1.

(2)  In accordance with section 45-3128(d) of this article, transitional buffer areas shall not be required within the neighborhood conservation district when multiple family zoning districts abut single-family zoning districts. 
(3)  The term "transitional buffer area" as used in this section shall apply to the area in the higher intensity district between the principal use and the zoning district line. This transitional buffer area shall contain a minimum number of plant materials in order to meet the standards set forth in this section and to provide the required vegetative density. The required vegetative density for transitional buffer area(s) shall be defined as each four hundred (400) square feet of transitional buffer areas (created by a twenty-foot by twenty-foot grid, excluding approved improvements, easements, or accessways) which contains at least two (2) healthy trees of two-inch caliper measured six (6) inches above the ground for single-stemmed deciduous trees or for multi-stemmed or evergreen trees, no less than eight (8) feet in height, or a combination thereof; and two (2) large growing evergreen shrubs, with a minimum height of forty-eight (48) inches, capable of reaching ten (10) feet at maturity. It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance that in the transitional buffer area(s) the owner of said property shall retain existing mature vegetation and to supplement such vegetation where necessary to meet the vegetative density defined above. All transitional buffer area(s) shall be properly maintained to assure that they will function effectively and continuously. 
The transitional buffer area shall contain no structure or improvements that promote or encourage the concentration of people, vehicles, or noise or otherwise produce conditions not compatible with the intensity of uses permitted in the abutted lower intensity district. 
When supplementing the plant materials in the area(s) buffer to meet the required vegetative density, any re-vegetation shall require the planting of two (2) trees (one (1) shall be a large growing variety and one (1) shall be a small growing variety) per four hundred (400) square feet of transitional buffer area. If the two (2) trees will be newly installed, then one (1) shall be evergreen, and one (1) shall be deciduous. The minimum sizes for the installed trees shall be two-inch caliper, measured six (6) inches above the ground, for single stemmed, deciduous trees, and eight (8) feet in height for multi-stemmed or evergreen trees. 
In addition to the trees, two (2) large growing evergreen shrubs, with a minimum forty-eight (48) inches installed height, shall be required every four hundred (400) square feet of transitional buffer area for transitional buffer areas non-adjacent to public streets. For transitional buffer areas adjacent to public streets, the installation of three (3) low growing shrubs, capable of maturing at three (3) feet in height shall be required for every four hundred (400) square feet of transitional buffer area. The low growing shrubs may be evergreen or deciduous, with a minimum installed height and/or spread of eighteen (18) inches. When visual barriers are required by Site Regulations Section 33.02-51(6)c. and the two (2) land areas coincide, then the visual barrier shrub requirement shall govern and serve to fulfill the transitional buffer area shrub requirement. 
Hand grooming of dead, diseased, or injured vegetation, and removal of nuisance vines shall be permitted within transitional buffer area(s). No grading shall be permitted within transitional buffer area(s). Maintenance of grass, and removal of weeds, trash and debris as specified in sections 13-150 and 13-180 of the City Code shall be required. All plant materials, pre-existing or newly installed, within the transitional buffer area(s) shall be maintained in perpetuity in accordance with an approved site plan or development plan whichever is applicable. Appropriate plant replacements shall be provided in the event that fifty (50) percent or more of a plants' vegetation is diseased, damaged or dead and the affected vegetation creates a deficit or void in the required vegetative density. 
Tree protection fencing for existing vegetation shall be erected prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit and shall be maintained until all construction activities on the site have been completed. The limits of tree protection fencing shall be established no closer than five (5) feet outside the dripline of the existing vegetation and shall be a minimum height of forty (40) inches and sufficient to prevent intrusion into the protected area. The location, type and installation details for the tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown on the approved site plan or development plan whichever is applicable. 
(4)  If the transitional buffer area does not abut a public street and contains existing vegetation (trees, shrubs, or ground covers) the transitional buffer area shall remain undisturbed, in its natural state, and supplemented, where necessary, to meet the required vegetative density. Within the transitional buffer area, all existing healthy trees, shrubs, and ground covers shall be preserved and protected. Hand grooming shall be limited to the removal of dead, diseased, or injured limbs. If the transitional buffer area does not meet the required vegetative density, then additional plant materials (except those trees prohibited in the Site Regulations, Section 33.02-51.(c)(2)e.) shall be planted in conformance with the standards of the most recent edition of the "American Standards for Nursery Stock" and the standards defined above. 
(5)  If the transitional buffer area abuts a public street(s), then removal of existing shrubs or ground covers and/or trees less than six (6) inches in caliper shall be permitted with an approved landscape plan showing the required re-vegetation of one (1) large tree, one (1) small tree and three (3) low growing shrubs. Existing overstory trees may be "limbed-up" to a maximum height of ten (10) feet above the tree base and existing understory trees may be "limbed-up" to a maximum height of six (6) feet. The landscape plan shall provide the required vegetative density (consisting of either newly proposed and/or existing) and replacement plant materials as set forth above. 
(6)  When the zoning line falls on a public street, railroad, or other public right-of-way, the buffer shall begin along the property line of the higher intensity district. Where the zoning line falls within a body of water, the buffer shall begin at the edge of mean low water of the higher intensity district. However, pedestrian and vehicular access such as sidewalks, driveways, entrances, landscaping, plantings, street furniture and the like shall be permitted in buffers along public streets, railroads, other public rights-of-way, and bodies of water. 
(7)  For undeveloped sites that are greater than ninety thousand (90,000) square feet, when a required buffer coincides or shares land area with an easement, the transitional buffer area width or easement width shall be relocated so that they will not coincide or overlap. The relocation of either area shall begin at the adjacent interior shared edge of the transitional buffer area or easement. In determining the relocation of the area(s), consideration shall be given to existing trees/vegetation residing on the site. The transitional buffer area(s) shall be located to maximize the inclusion of naturally occurring trees/vegetation on the site. Where no vegetation exists within the transitional buffer area(s), plant materials shall be installed, maintained and replaced in accordance to [sub]section (2) above. 
(8)  For redeveloped sites or sites that are equal to or less than ninety thousand (90,000) square feet, collocation of easements and transitional buffer areas shall be permitted up to fifty (50) percent of the greater of the two (2) widths. Should the easement width be greater than the transitional buffer area width, no more than fifty (50) percent of the transitional buffer area width shall coincide within the easement area. In determining the collocation of the areas, consideration shall be given to existing trees/vegetation residing on the site. The transitional buffer area(s) shall be located to maximize the inclusion of naturally occurring trees/vegetation on site. Where no vegetation exists within the transitional buffer area(s), plant materials shall be installed, maintained and replaced in accordance to [sub]section (2) above. The portion of the transitional buffer area that is collocated within an easement shall be exempt from re-vegetation, but that same portion shall remain a green area consisting of a viable turf grass and maintained according to sections 13-150 and 13-180 of the City Code. 
(9)  Within a transitional buffer area, an easement shall be permitted to cross the transitional buffer area in such a way as to minimize the land area impacted by the crossing and shall be excluded from the re-vegetation requirement. All breaks shall cross transitional buffer areas at right angles. 
(10)  The board of zoning appeals may grant a special exception for the use or reduction of the transitional buffer area subject to the conditions prescribed in Article XXXII, section 45-3204. 
(f)  Special provisions for the waiver of yard requirements in commercial zoning districts. In order to allow the subdivision of commercial property on which commercial units are for sale, for sale in condominium or for lease and which are constructed as part of a multi-unit structure in which the units share common walls or as part of a multiple-structure commercial development, and provided the entire development has been planned and designed as a cohesive, coordinated unit under a single master plan, a waiver may be granted from any part of section 45-2003, section 45-2103 and section 45-2203 upon finding that: 
(1)  The overall complex or structure, if considered as a single unit, meets all of the requirements of section 45-2003, section 45-2103 or section 45-2203 upon finding that; 
(2)  Adequate parking is provided as per the requirements of this chapter and, where deemed necessary by the commission, adequate easements or other agreements are recorded to guarantee access and maintenance of the parking areas and other common areas. 
(g)  Side yard modifications. For additions to buildings on developed corner lots existing on the date the zoning ordinance became effective, August 1, 1997, the required side yard along the street shall be established as a straight line drawn from the closest side corner(s) of the building and extended to the rear property line. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1; Ord. No. 5096-98, § 1; Ord. No. 5723-02; Ord. No. 6572-09; Ord. No. 6728-10)  
Sec. 45-2803. - Modification of lot frontage. 
The minimum lot frontage of a lot shall be not less than the lot width at the front yard setback line. The frontage of any lot located on the turnaround of a cul-de-sac (dead-end street) may be reduced to not less than that specified for a cul-de-sac in each district. Except where easements or topography require otherwise, in single-family detached subdivisions lot lines shall be established radially on culs-de-sac and curvilinear streets and perpendicular to the right-of-way on straight streets. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2804. - Modification to lot area and floor area ratio regulations. 
(a)  Usable land area. Not less than eighty (80) percent of the minimum lot area required by the zoning ordinance shall be usable land by reason of elevation above flood level and not less than fifty (50) percent of such required minimum lot area shall be usable by reason of absence of easements or servitudes; provided, however, that all of the minimum area required for the building itself together with its required front, side and rear yard lines shall be usable land. 
(b)  For computing floor area ratio. Within any district in which floor area ratio is specified as a regulation, such permissible floor area shall be computed based on the actual lot area and the actual floor area. To be excluded from total floor area, parking or recreational space shall be specifically equipped and permanently reserved for such use. Any open area which includes permissible facilities such as a swimming pool, roof gardens, sitting areas or other such uses shall be regarded as creditable recreational area only if such areas meet all of the requirements specified below. For computing the permitted floor area, the following shall be excluded from the computation of total floor area: 
(1)  The total area used on the same lot for required off-street parking spaces permanently located within any enclosed building or structure. 
(2)  The actual open area used for recreational activities located within or upon buildings or structures; provided: 
a.  Such space is open, usable and accessible to all persons who occupy dwelling units on the same premises; provided, however, that for the purposes of safety of the residents, such facilities may be restricted to use during reasonable hours. 
b.  No dimension of such recreational area shall be less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
c.  Such areas are located on the same lot as the principal use it serves. 
(c)  For computing open lot area. Within a district in which open lot area is specified as a regulation for multiple-dwelling units, such open lot area shall be computed by subtracting such area of a lot as may be covered by an existing or proposed building or structure from the total lot area, or in lieu thereof, the adjusted lot area as defined in this section. 
(d)  Adjustment to lot area requirement for number of bedrooms. The lot area or open lot area requirement, as the case may be, for multiple dwelling uses required in this chapter applies to dwelling units having two (2) bedrooms exclusive of any floor area used or designed to be used primarily for other than sleeping purposes. In any zoning district where a multiple-family dwelling project contains dwelling units containing either more or less than two (2) bedrooms, the required minimum lot area or open lot area shall be adjusted for such dwelling units according to the following table: 
TABLE 28-2 

ADJUSTMENTS FOR REQUIRED LOT AREA OR OPEN LOT AREA 
Number of Bedrooms in Dwelling Unit 	Increase or Decrease in Minimum Lot Area or Open Lot Area 
4 Bedrooms or more 	Add 200 square feet per dwelling unit 
3 Bedrooms 	Add 100 square feet per dwelling unit 
1 Bedroom 	Subtract 100 square feet per dwelling unit 
Efficiency Apartment 	Subtract 200 square feet per dwelling unit 
 
(e)  For computing lot coverage. The percentage of lot coverage shall be computed by dividing the total ground floor area of proposed buildings or structures by the total area of the developed site as follows: 
Lot Coverage = (Total Ground Floor Area Division ° Total Site Area) × 100% 
In determining lot coverage, the following shall be excluded from ground floor area: surface parking lots; underground parking structures; recreational amenities and features such as swimming pools, fountains, walks, gardens, sitting areas; and, works of art. The ground floor area of above ground parking structures also shall be excluded when an equivalent amount of recreational or landscaped open space is provided on the same developed site. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2805. - Modification to height regulations. 
Height regulations may be adjusted as follows: 
(1)  Public buildings. Public, semi-public or public service buildings, hospitals, schools or institutions when permitted in a district maybe erected to any height if the building is set back from the side and rear yard lines one (1) additional foot for each one (1) foot of building height above the height limit of the district in which the building is located. 
(2)  Projections above maximum height limitations. The height regulations of this chapter shall not apply to parapet walls extending not more than four (4) feet above the limiting height of the building, church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, fire towers, cooling towers, elevator head houses, silos, ornamental towers, chimney flues, flagpoles, or antennas. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2806. - Accessory buildings and structures. 
Accessory buildings and structures may be constructed in a rear or side yard in conformity with regulations for accessory buildings in the district in which such use is located and the following regulations: 
(1)  Percent of yard covered. Not more than thirty (30) percent of a required rear yard shall be occupied by an accessory building or structure. 
(2)  When part of main building. Accessory buildings and structures located closer than ten (10) feet to the main building shall be construed to be a part of the main building for the purposes of yard regulations and such buildings and structures, whether connected to the main building or not, shall observe all front, side and rear yard regulations applicable to main buildings. 
(3)  Construction and use. No accessory building and structure shall be authorized or constructed upon a lot until the construction of a main building has been completed; and no accessory building and structure shall be used until the main building has been completed and is in use. 
(4)  Tents. Tents or tent-like structures shall not be erected as main buildings on any lot or tract in any district, temporarily or permanently, unless specifically provided for in the district regulations. 
(5)  Prohibited in front yards. Accessory buildings and structures shall not be permitted in the front yard of properties used for individual single-family, two-family, mobile home and townhouse units. 
However, if a main building is farther from the street than the front yard setback line established by a recorded subdivision plat, then an accessory building or structure may be placed in the portion of the front yard between the main building and the setback observed by the adjacent main building farthest from the street on the adjoining lots. 
(6)  Maximum height and floor area. The overall height and floor area of accessory buildings and structures shall not exceed one and one-half (1½) stories, the height or ground floor area of the main building on properties used for individual single-family, two-family, mobile homes and townhouse units. 
(7)  Signs, fences, walls and obstructions. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to alter or amend the provisions of Article XXVII of this Chapter or Chapter 33.01, Signs, of the City Code. Neither shall this section be construed to alter or amend the provisions of section 45-2807, Walls, Fences and Obstructions, below. 
(8)  Side yard modifications. For accessory buildings and structures on developed corner lots existing on the date the zoning ordinance became effective, August 1, 1997, the required side yard along the street shall be established as a straight line drawn from the closest side corner(s) of the building or structure and extended to the rear property line. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1; Ord. No. 5096-98, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2807. - Walls, fences and obstructions. 
(a)  Applicability. Yard requirements shall not apply to any necessary retaining wall, nor shall they apply to fences or other walls which are erected in conformity with other applicable municipal ordinances. 
(b)  Corner lots. On a corner lot, no planting, wall, fence, sign, display, or other obstruction to motorists' vision shall be planted, erected or maintained at any height between three (3) feet and ten (10) feet above the adjoining street curb grade or the edge of pavement, whichever is higher, within a clear sight triangle comprised of two (2) twenty (20) foot legs measured from the point of intersection of the property lines that abut rights-of-way. This section shall not apply in the C3 zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-2808. - Special building setbacks along expressways, arterials and collector streets. 
The special setback regulations included in this section shall apply to buildings and structures in all districts abutting any portion of the expressways, arterials and collector streets in the following table 28-3 where the minimum front yard requirements would produce a building line closer to the centerline of the proposed right-of-way than the special building setback requirements listed:

Cross reference Article XXXII. 
 
Sec. 45-2901. - General. 
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the impairment of any vested right; except that uses existing at the effective date of this chapter which do not conform to the zoning prescribed for the district in which they are situated may be continued only so long as: 
(1)  The then existing or a more restricted use continues; 
(2)  Such use is not discontinued for more than two (2) years; 
(3)  The buildings or structures are maintained in their then structural condition; and 
(4)  The uses of such buildings or structures shall conform to the regulations of the district in which they are located whenever they are enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, except as provided elsewhere in this article. 
(5)  No nonconforming building or structure may be moved on the same lot or to any other lot which is not properly zoned to permit such nonconforming use. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the city, after making a reasonable attempt to notify such property owner, from ordering the removal of a nonconforming sign that has been abandoned. For purposes of this section, a sign shall be considered abandoned if the business for which the sign was erected has not been in operation for a period of at least two (2) years. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the land owner or home owner from removing a valid nonconforming manufactured home from a mobile or manufactured home park and replacing that home with another comparable manufactured home that meets the current HUD manufactured housing code. In such mobile or manufactured home park, a single-section home may replace a single-section home and a multi-section home may replace a multi-section home. The owner of a valid non-conforming manufactured home not located in a mobile or manufactured home park may replace that home with a newer manufactured home, either single- or multi-section, that meets the current HUD manufactured housing code. Any such replacement home shall retain the valid nonconforming status of the prior home.

Sec. 45-2902. - Reconstruction. 
In the event that all or a part of a nonconforming structure or structure supporting a nonconforming use is destroyed by accidental fire, excluding arson committed by the property owner, or by act of God, the structure may be reconstructed providing: 
(1)  Reconstruction shall be limited to structures destroyed by such fire or act of God and shall not exceed the degree of nonconformity which existed prior to such destruction; 
(2)  All yards, height and other applicable dimensional regulations of the district in which the use is located shall be observed, to the extent physically possible; 
(3)  Any reconstruction shall be limited to the same premises on which the structure existed at the time the use or structure became nonconforming; provided, that in no case shall the nonconforming use be expanded; 
(4)  The owner shall apply for a building permit and any work done to repair, rebuild or replace such structure shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code and any work done to repair, rebuild or replace such structure shall be in compliance with the provisions of the city's floodplain regulations; and 
(5)  Unless the nonconforming structure is repaired, rebuilt or replaced within two (2) years of the date of such fire, natural disaster or other act of God, such structure shall only be repaired, rebuilt or replaced in accordance with the provisions of the city's zoning ordinance. However, if the nonconforming structure is in an area under federal disaster declaration and the structure has been damaged or destroyed as a direct result of conditions that gave rise to the declaration, then the owner shall have an additional two (2) years for the structure to be repaired, rebuilt or replaced.

Sec. 45-3001. - General. 
(a)  When required. Unless otherwise modified or exempted in the district regulations or in Article XXVIII, there shall be provided in all districts at the time any building or structure is erected, off-street parking and loading spaces in conformity with the requirements of this article. In the event a building or structure is altered so as to increase its floor area, off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided for such enlargement in conformity with this article. 
(b)  Continued use required. Any off-street parking or loading space required by this article shall be maintained for parking or loading use, as the case may be, as long as the principal use such off-street parking or loading spaces were established to serve shall remain. 
(c)  Encroachment upon existing spaces. In no case shall an addition to a building or structure be made in such a way as to reduce the number of existing parking or loading spaces of an existing building or structure below the minimum requirements of this article unless provisions are made elsewhere on the same premises to re-establish any required parking or loading spaces which may be removed or relocated. 
(d)  Location on same premises. Except as otherwise provided, all off-street parking and loading spaces required by this article shall be located on the same premises with the principal use such spaces are established to serve. 
(e)  Ingress and egress. Ingress and egress to and from off-street parking and loading spaces shall be made through driveway openings, the required number, location and width of which shall be determined by the city's traffic engineer. 
(f)  Distinction between loading and parking spaces. Off-street loading spaces shall be exclusive of the number of off-street parking spaces required in this article. 
(g)  Method of computing number of spaces. In computing the number of parking or loading spaces required by this article, the following rules shall govern. 
(1)  Floor area shall mean the gross usable floor area of a particular use, building or structure. 
(2)  Where a fractional space results, the number of parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next whole number. 
(3)  If a particular use is not included in the listing of specific uses in this article, such use shall be provided with parking spaces as required for a listed use of similar nature. 
(4)  Whenever a building or use is changed or enlarged in floor area, or modified as to increase the number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity in or any other manner to create a need for a greater number of parking or loading spaces than the use existing, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change in conformity with this article. 
(5)  In the event more than one (1) use which requires parking and loading spaces is erected on the same premises, the total parking spaces or loading space requirements shall be the sum of the requirements of individual uses computed separately. 
(6)  Whenever commercial motor vehicles, mobile products, or special equipment are required to be parked on the premises in connection with a use, any required off-street parking spaces shall be in addition to the space requirement to park such commercial vehicles. 
(7)  For the purposes of this chapter, unoccupied floor area shall not be included in the computation of required parking spaces. Such floor area shall include, but not be limited to the following: vaults, refrigerated storage rooms, bulk storage, machine rooms, automated production areas, aircraft hangers, heavy equipment and/or vehicle storage, and stockrooms or offices for retail establishments . 
(h)  Parking commercial vehicles. 
(1)  Parking of commercial vehicles on property in residential districts shall be limited to one (1) small commercial vehicle per parcel for any detached single-family dwelling and shall be limited to one (1) such small commercial vehicle per single-family dwelling unit on any multiple-family residential site; provided that, one (1) additional small or large commercial vehicle may be parked on the same property in an enclosed and approved accessory building. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any commercial vehicle while in the process of loading or unloading. 
(2)  The parking of school buses shall be permitted on school property. 
(3)  Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of section 45-515, pertaining to recreational vehicles.

Sec. 45-3103. - Airport zones and zoning map. 
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones that include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport. Such zones are shown on the City of Newport News Zoning Maps. 
An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Precision instrument runway approach zone: 
a.  This zone applies to runway 7R-25L and proposed runway 7L-25R. 
b.  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than three-quarters (¾) mile nonprecision instrument approach zone:

Sec. 45-3106. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive: Except as provided in section 45-3107(b) of this article, the regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this chapter shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Obstruction marking and lighting: Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45-3107(a) of this article, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of whatever markers and lights deemed necessary by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Virginia Department of Aviation or the Zoning Administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of that airport obstruction. These markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the airport owners, and not the owner of the nonconforming structure in question. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1)  
Sec. 45-3107. - Permits. 
(a)  Future use: No structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in the horizontal zone created by this chapter which will exceed one hundred and ninety-three (193) feet of vertical height above mean sea level unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for to include filing of FAA for 7460 available at the airport and provided that a variance has been approved as provided in subsection (d). 
(b)  Existing uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use or structure to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto other than with relief as provided for in subsection (d). 
(c)  Reconstruction: No permit shall be granted that would enable a nonconforming structure or object to be rebuilt, reconstructed, or otherwise refurbished so as to exceed the applicable horizontal zone height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations contained in this chapter except as provided for in Article XXIX, Nonconforming uses, section 45-2902, Reconstruction, of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(d)  Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height or size of any structure not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply for a variance from such regulations to the board of zoning appeals as described in Article XXXII of the Zoning Ordinance. Such application shall be properly advertised and be reviewed and considered through a public hearing. Prior to being considered by the board of zoning appeals, the application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Virginia Department of Aviation as to the facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall only be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for a variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of zoning appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport owner for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport owner does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of zoning appeals may act on its own to grant or deny the application for a variance. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be deemed necessary by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Virginia Department of Aviation or the zoning administrator. If deemed proper by the board of zoning appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the airport owner, at his own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

Sec. 45-3110. - Purpose and authority. 
This division is adopted pursuant to authority granted by Virginia Code § 15.2-2280 and Virginia Code §10.1-600, et seq. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of life and property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by: 
(1)  Regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies. 
(2)  Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within district subject to flooding. 
(3)  Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and flood damage. 
(4)  Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1; Ord. No. 7123-14, § 1)  
Sec. 45-3111. - General provisions. 
(a)  Applicability: These provisions shall apply to all privately and publicly owned lands within the jurisdiction of Newport News and identified as areas of special flood hazard according to the flood insurance rate map that is provided to the city of Newport News by FEMA, as set forth in section 45-3114(a)(1) below. 
(b)  Compliance and liability: No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. 
(1)  The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or that land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
(2)  This section shall not create liability on the part of the city of Newport News or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(c)  Records: Records of actions associated with administering this section shall be kept on file and maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(d)  Abrogation and greater restrictions: This division supersedes any ordinance currently in effect in flood-prone districts. 
(e)  Severability: If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this division shall be declared invalid for any reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this division. The remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect; and for this purpose, the provisions of this division are hereby declared to be severable. 
(f)  Penalty for violations: Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of the division of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties therefore. 
(1)  Chapter 13 Building Regulations of the Newport News City Code section 13-23 Adopted; general construction standards adopts the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (VA USBC). Section 13-2 addresses the general penalty for violations of chapter 13. Violations and associated penalties of chapter 45, Zoning Ordinance, of Newport News City Code are addressed in article 35, Administration, Enforcement, Violation Penalty and Remedy. Any violations of chapter 13 and chapter 45 may be enforced according to said sections and may be brought in addition to the violations of division 2, article XXXI of chapter 45. 
(2)  In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in noncompliance with this article may be declared by the City of Newport News to be a public nuisance and abatable as such. Flood insurance may be withheld from structures constructed in violation of this article.

(m)  Existing construction: structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before May 2, 1977 for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
(n)  Flood or flooding: 
(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
c.  Mudflows which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in subsection b. above of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(2)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in subsection (1) above. 
(o)  Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM): An official map of a community issued by the administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide, and related erosion areas have been designated and the floodway, floodway fringe, approximated floodplain and coastal high hazard areas have been delineated.

(w)  Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization in the watershed. When a freeboard is included in the height of a structure, the flood insurance premiums may be less expensive. 
(x)  Highest adjacent grade: the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

ALOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and establishes that a specific property or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(ee)  Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
(ff)  Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas.

(nn)  Repetitive loss structure: A building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two (2) occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood event. 
(oo)  Shallow flooding area: A special flood hazard area with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
(pp)  Special flood hazard area: The land in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year as determined in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for the city of Newport News prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration. 
(qq)  Start of construction: For other than new construction and substantial improvement under the Coastal Barriers resource Act (P.L. - 97-348) 16 U.S.C. § 3501, et seq., mean the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings piers, or foundations of the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds nor occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(rr)  Structure: for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
(ss)  Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(tt)  Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure". 
(3)  Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(uu)  Trailer park (mobile home park): An area designed, constructed, equipped, operated and maintained for the purpose of providing spaces for trailers or mobile homes intended to be used as temporary or permanent living facilities. 
(vv)  Violation: the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.

b.  If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in this division prepare amendments to this division to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to City Council for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended division shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
(16)  Upon the request of FEMA, complete and submit a report concerning participation in the NFIP which may request information regarding the number of buildings in the SFHA, number of permits issued for development in the SFHA, and number of variances issued for development in the SFHA. 
(17)  It is the duty of the floodplain administrator to take into account flood, mudslide and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use throughout the City of Newport News, whether or not those hazards have been specifically delineated geographically (e.g. via mapping or surveying). 
(c)  Use and interpretation of FIRMs. The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
(1)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations: 
a.  Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this division; 
b.  Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regarded as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(2)  In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 
(3)  Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations. 
(4)  Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 
(5)  If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA: 
a.  Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
b.  Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to section 1.5(C) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM. 
c.  Prior to issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
(d)  Jurisdictional boundary changes. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the floodplain boundaries, base flood elevation, and location of the floodway where determined. 
If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in this division, the floodplain administrator, with the assistance of the city attorney, will prepare amendments to this division to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the City Council for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended division shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 44 Subpart (B) Section 59.22(a)(9)(v), the city must notify the Federal Insurance Administration and optionally the state coordinating office in writing whenever the boundaries of the city have been modified by annexation or the city has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. 
In order that all flood insurance rate maps accurately represent the city's boundaries, a copy of a map of Newport News suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the city has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority must be included with the notification. 
(e)  District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the city of Newport News where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(f)  Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the zoning officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
(g)  Submitting technical data. The city's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information becomes available, the city shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
(h)  Letters of map revision. When development in the floodplain causes a change in the base flood elevation, the applicant must notify FEMA by applying for a conditional letter of map revision or a letter of map revision. 
Examples: 
Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway. 
Any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than one (1) foot in the base flood elevation. 
Alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges, as required by 44 C.F.R. § 65.3 and §65.6(a)(12).

Sec. 45-3114. - Establishment of flood hazard overlay district. 
(a)  An overlay district to be known as the FH-flood hazard district is hereby established. Upon identification by the floodplain administrator, areas having special flood hazards but where water surface elevation data for the one-hundred-year flood and data sufficient to identify the floodway have not been delineated, the definitions of section 45-3112 are in effect. 
(1)  Basis of district. The various floodplain districts shall include the special flood hazard areas (SFHAs). The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the flood insurance study (FIS) and the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) for the city of Newport News prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated December 9, 2014 and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto. 
The city of Newport News may identify and regulate local flood hazard or ponding areas that are not delineated on the FIRM. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
The boundaries of the SFHA districts and floodplain districts are established as shown on the FIRM, which is declared to be a part of this division and which shall be kept on file at the City of Newport News Department of Engineering. 
a.  The floodway district is in an AE Zone and is delineated, for purposes of this regulation, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one (1) percent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. The areas included in this district are specifically identified in the above-referenced FIS and shown on the accompanying FIRM. The following provisions shall apply within the floodway district of an AE zone (see, 44 CFR 60.3(d)): 
1.  Within any floodway area, no encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies, with the city on Newport News' endorsement, for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR), and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
If the requirements of this section are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article 4. 
2.  The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring, elevation and encroachment standards are met. 
(b)  The AE zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which one (1) percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided and the floodway has not been delineated, The following provisions shall apply within an AE zone: 
(1)  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as Zones A1-30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Newport News. This requirement, pursuant to 44 CFR 63.3(c)(10), only applies along rivers, streams, and other watercourses where FEMA has provided base flood elevations. The requirement does not apply along lakes, bays and estuaries, and the ocean coast. 
(2)  Development activities in Zones A1-A30 and AE, on the city of Newport News FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one (1) foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies, with the City of Newport News' endorsement, for a conditional letter of map revision, receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(c)  The A zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the one (1) percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply, pursuant to 44 CFR 60.3(b): 
(1)  The approximated floodplain district shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a one-hundred-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as Zone A on the maps accompanying the FIS. For these areas, the base flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, local and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific one (1) percent annual chance flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers floodplain information reports, U.S. Geological Survey flood-prone quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this base flood elevation. For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted non-detailed technical concepts, such as point on boundary, high water marks, or detailed methodologies hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Studies, analysis, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
(2)  The floodplain administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for any development. When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to two (2) feet above the base flood level. During the permitting process, the floodplain administrator shall obtain: 
a.  The elevation of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and 
b.  If the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been floodproofed. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be obtained from other sources or develop using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a FIS for subdivision proposals and other proposed development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(d)  The AO zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall of those areas of shallow flooding identified as AO on the FIRM. For those areas the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to the specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with wall substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyance. 
(3)  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(e)  The Coastal A Zone District shall be those areas designated as Limits of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA) line and the VE Zone on the FIRM, and subject to wave heights between one and one-half (1.5) feet and three (3) feet. Buildings and structures in the these areas shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard, and must comply with applicable provisions of sections 45-3114 and 45-3115 of this division. 
(f)  The VE or V Zones on FIRMs accompanying the FIS shall be those areas that are known as Coastal High Hazard areas, extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V and VE (V if base flood elevation is available) shall be elevated on pilings or columns so that: 
a.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated two (2) feet above the base flood level if the lowest horizontal structural member is parallel to the direction of wave approach or elevated at least two (2) feet above the base flood level of the lowest horizontal structural member is perpendicular to the direction of wave approach; and. 
b.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (one (1) percent chance). 
(2)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of these regulations. 
(3)  The floodplain administrator shall obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in Zones V and VE. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
(4)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
(5)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood-lattice work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
a.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
b.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
(6)  The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be portioned into multiple rooms, temperature-controlled, or used for human habitation. 
(7)  The use of fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited. When non-structural fill is proposed in a coastal high hazard area, appropriate engineering analyses shall be conducted to evaluate the impacts of the fill prior to issuance of a development permit. 
(8)  The man-made alteration of sand dunes, which would increase potential flood damage, is prohibited. 
(g)  Overlay concept. The floodplain districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying districts as shown on the official zoning ordinance map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. 
If there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the floodplain districts and those of any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the floodplain districts shall apply. 
In the event any provision concerning a floodplain district is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying provisions shall remain applicable.

Sec. 45-3166. - Guidelines and development standards. 
Purpose and intent: The following guidelines and development standards are intended to protect and enhance the visual experience from the established entrance corridors and to reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on scenic and historic sites. 
(a)  Guidelines. The development of any site within the Lee Hall Corridor Overlay District shall be in accordance with an approved master plan or site plan. Design and architectural features shall be consistent with the following provisions: 
(1)  Large work area doors or open bays of mixed use, commercial and industrial buildings shall not open toward or face the corridors. 
(2)  Active building elevations shall face public streets. Blank walls or loading areas shall not face public streets. 
(3)  Mechanical equipment, whether ground level or roof top, shall be either screened from view or located so that such mechanical equipment is not visible from the corridors identified in section 45-3163 of the City Code or adjacent properties. Large trash receptacles, dumpsters, utility meters, aboveground tanks, satellite dishes, antennas, etc., shall be similarly treated. Mechanical equipment on rooftops shall, to the extent possible, be hidden by building elements designed for that purpose as an integral part of the building design. 
(4)  Loading spaces for commercial and industrial sites shall be located only at the rear of buildings and should be out of view of the corridors identified in section 45-3163 of the City Code. Views from adjacent properties or uses must be minimized through site design, architectural design, topography, landscaping, setbacks or other features. 
(5)  Required parking areas should be located to the rear or side of main buildings or developed areas. 
(6)  Fencing along the corridor right-of-way should be of decorative (ornamental) style and located behind the landscape strip as required by the city's site regulations. 
(7)  Blank, solid walls should be avoided. 
(8)  Stucco, natural wood siding, brick, or other materials with similar texture and appearance shall be compatible with the area's character. Materials and colors should be varied where appropriate to provide architectural interest. 
(9)  Color schemes should be kept simple in character and harmonious in keeping with the period architecture. 
(10)  No building facade (whether front, side or rear) should consist of architectural materials inferior in quality, appearance, or detail to any other facade of the same building. The intent of this requirement is not to preclude the use of different materials on different buildings' facades (which would be acceptable if representative of good architectural design), but rather to preclude the use of inferior materials on sides that face adjoining property and thus, might adversely impact existing or future development. 
(11)  No visible portion of a building wall shall be constructed of corrugated material, sheet metal, or barren and unfinished cinder block. Standing seam metal roofs are acceptable. 
(12)  New architecture should be compatible with the area's design traditions, forms and materials. Generic franchise design is strongly discouraged. 
(13)  Buildings on the same site should have a strong spatial and functional relationship to each other and shall be varied in size and mass. 
(b)  Development standards. New subdivision, mixed-use, commercial and industrial development within this Lee Hall Overlay District should provide for visual compatibility and harmony with surrounding natural landforms and vegetation; be protective of views and vistas from the corridors identified in section 45-3163 of the City Code; and provide continuity of site design within the proposed development. These objectives include the following standards, in addition to the development standards specified for the underlying zones in the Zoning Ordinance: 
(1)  General. 
a.  Structures should not dominate, by excessive or inappropriate height or mass, any general development, adjacent building, or natural landscape. 
b.  Natural amenities such as views, trees, water courses, and other natural features should be preserved and incorporated into the site design. 
c.  Impervious surface areas should be minimized and landscaped areas should be maximized. 
d.  The maximum height of all structures shall be as permitted by the development standards for the underlying zoning district. 
e.  Outdoor storage as an accessory use shall be as permitted, provided that all outdoor storage areas are visually screened from public rights-of-way, internal roadways, and adjacent property. Screening shall consist of either a masonry wall, dense evergreen plants, or such other materials as may be found compatible and approved by the director of planning. All such screening shall be of sufficient height to screen storage areas from public view and shall be appropriately landscaped in accordance with the standards set forth in section 45-512 of the City Code. All company owned and operated vehicles, with the exception of passenger vehicles, are subject to this provision. 
f.  Site development should include streetscape improvements. These improvements are considered as those architectural or functional facilities or structures that occur on site but are not part of the building and that encourage and facilitate human interaction with the built environment. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: decorative light fixtures, fountains, sculptures, benches and tables, planters, retaining walls, pedestrian and bicycle paths, bicycle parking structures, driveways and parking areas except in historic places where these materials are incompatible with the character of the historic place. 
(c)  Grading and drainage. 
(1)  Development activities should avoid excessive or unsightly grading, indiscriminate earth moving or clearing of property, and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause disruption of natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms. 
(2)  Grading for new development shall not adversely affect adjacent property. 
(3)  Grading should not occur within the dripline of any tree(s) being preserved. 
(4)  Drainage shall be designed so as not to interfere with pedestrian traffic. 
(d)  Parking and circulation. 
(1)  Parking lot, traffic areas, and loading and unloading area requirements shall be as established by City Code Chapter 33.02-52, Site Regulations. In addition, the following shall apply: 
a.  Vehicular movement and parking areas shall be paved with concrete, asphalt, exposed aggregate, or pavers. Vehicular movement and parking areas surfaced with gravel or other similar material are prohibited except in historic places where these materials are compatible with the character of the historic place. Concrete curb and gutter or other stormwater management structure as approved by the director of engineering shall be installed around the perimeter of all parking areas. 
b.  All vehicle parking areas shall, whenever practicable, be located to the side or rear of the primary structure and screened with landscaping to soften the view from any public right-of-way. When vehicle parking areas must be located in front of the principal structure, a continuous hedge or landscaped berm or decorative wall of at least three (3) feet in height must be constructed to screen the parking area from any public right-of-way. 
c.  On large commercial sites, parking areas between outparcel buildings and the adjacent street are discouraged. 
(e)  Lighting.

(2)  Variances: The board is empowered to authorize on appeal or original application in specific cases a variance from the terms of this chapter provided that the burden of proof shall be on the applicant for a variance to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his application meets the standard for a variance and the criteria set out in section 45-3203. 
(3)  Special exceptions: The board is empowered to hear and decide upon applications for such special exceptions as are authorized in this chapter. 
(4)  Interpretation of zoning district boundary lines: The board is empowered to hear and decide applications for interpretation of the zoning district map where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a district boundary.

(6)  No power to rezone: No provision of this chapter shall be construed as granting the board the power to rezone property or to base board decisions on the merits of the purpose and intent of any ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1; Ord. No. 5484-00, § 1; Ord. No. 5992-03, § 1; Ord. No. 7193-15)  
Sec. 45-3202. - Procedure for appeal of alleged administrative errors. 
(a)  An appeal to the board for an alleged administrative error may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the zoning administrator. 
(b)  An appeal must be taken within thirty (30) days after the decision appealed from by filing with the zoning administrator and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals for a notice of violation involving temporary or seasonal commercial uses, parking of commercial vehicles in residential zoning districts, or similar short term, recurring violations must be taken within ten (10) days after notice of the violation is provided. 
(c)  Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Such papers shall also be made available without cost to the appellant within three business days of providing such materials to the board. 
(d)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order granted by the board or by a court of record, on application and with notice to the zoning administrator, and for good cause shown. 
(e)  The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal, give public notice once a week for two (2) successive weeks in some newspaper published, or having general circulation in the City of Newport News, as well as due notice to the parties in interest and decide the same within ninety (90) days of the filing of the appeal. The public notice shall specify the time and place of the hearing and final notice shall appear not less than six (6) nor more than twenty-one (21) days before the date of the public hearing. The term two (2) successive weeks shall mean that such notice shall be published at least twice in a newspaper with not less than six (6) days elapsing between the first and second publication.

(Ord. No. 5028-97, § 1; Ord. No. 5484-00, § 1; Ord. No. 6713-10; Ord. No. 7193-15)  
Sec. 45-3203. - Procedure for review and approval of variances. 
(a)  An application for a variance may be made by any property owner, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau and shall be filed with the zoning administrator. Applications shall not be processed unless the applicant provides satisfactory evidence that any delinquent real estate taxes owed to the city which have been properly assessed against the subject property have been paid. 
(b)  Such application shall completely disclose the equitable ownership of the real estate to be affected including, in the case of corporate ownership, the names of stockholders, officers and directors and in any case the names and addresses of all of the real parties of interest. However, the requirement of listing names of stockholders, officers and directors shall not apply to a corporation whose stock is traded on a national or local stock exchange and having more than five hundred (500) shareholders. In the case of a condominium, the requirement shall apply only to the title owner, contract purchaser, or lessee if they own ten (10) percent or more of the units in the condominium. 
(c)  The board shall conduct a hearing on said application subsequent to the notice requirements contained in subsection 45-3202(e). 
(d)  "Variance" means, in the application of this chapter, a reasonable deviation from those provisions regulating the shape, size, or area of a lot or parcel of land; or the size, height, area, bulk, or location of a building or structure when the strict application of the ordinance would unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property, and such need for a variance would not be shared generally by other properties, and provided such variance is not contrary to the purpose of the ordinance. It shall not include a change in use, which change shall be accomplished by a rezoning or by a conditional zoning. 
(1)  The board shall not authorize a variance unless it finds: 
a.  That the strict application of this ordinance would unreasonably restrict utilization of the property or the granting of the variance would alleviate a hardship due to a physical condition relating to the property or improvements thereon at the time of the effective date of the ordinance or alleviate a hardship by granting a reasonable modification to a property or improvements thereon requested by, or on behalf of, a person with a disability, and the property interest for which the variance is being requested was acquired in good faith and any hardship was not created by the applicant for the variance. 
b.  That the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and nearby properties in the proximity of that geographical area. 
c.  That the condition or situation of the property concerned is not so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this chapter. 
d.  That the granting of the variance does not result in a use that is not otherwise permitted on such property or a change in the zoning classification of the property. 
e.  That the relief or remedy sought by the variance application is not available through a special exception process or through modification of a zoning ordinance, both of which are authorized in this chapter. 
(e)  Any variance granted to provide a reasonable modification to a property or improvements thereon requested by, or on behalf of, a person with a disability may expire when the person benefitted by it is no longer in need of the modification to such property or improvements provided by the variance, subject to the provisions of state and federal fair housing laws, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq.) as applicable. 
(f)  In authorizing a variance, the board may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to insure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the property upon which a property owner has been granted a variance shall be treated as conforming for all purposes under state law and local ordinances. The use or the structure permitted by the variance may not be expanded, unless the expansion is within an area of the site or part of the structure for which no variance is required. Where expansion is proposed within an area of the site or part of the structure for which a variance is required, the expansion may not occur unless an additional variance is obtained.

Sec. 45-3204. - Procedure for review and approval of special exceptions. 
(a)  Applications for special exceptions may be made by any property owner, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau and shall be filed with the director of planning or his authorized representative. Applications shall not be processed unless the applicant provides satisfactory evidence that any delinquent real estate taxes owed to the city which have been properly assessed against the subject property have been paid. 
(b)  The board shall refer all special exception applications to the city planning commission for its recommendation. The city planning commission shall review the referred application and submit its recommendation to the board within sixty (60) days of the first meeting of the planning commission subsequent to referral. The planning commission report shall state whether the proposed special exception is in harmony with the intent of the applicable regulations in this zoning ordinance. In making its report, the planning commission may recommend to the board any conditions which should be attached to the special exception as to make it compatible with surrounding development. Failure of the planning commission to report within the prescribed sixty-day period shall be construed as an affirmative recommendation. 
(c)  Prior to action by the planning commission on any special exception, the applicant must meet with the director of planning, or his representative, to determine the appropriateness of the application and who may require such supporting information as he may deem to be necessary, including: 
(1)  A legal description of the property for which the special exception is requested. 
(2)  Complete disclosure of the equitable ownership of the real estate to be affected including, in the case of corporate ownership, the names of stockholders, officers and directors and in any case the names and addresses of all of the real parties of interest.

e.  Such additional supporting information as may be deemed necessary by the director of planning to perform the evaluations required herein, including, but not limited to, topography, ingress and egress, vegetation, surrounding land use, proposed connections to existing or proposed water, sewer and drainage facilities. 
(d)  After notice as specified in section 45-3202(e), the board shall conduct a hearing on the application. The board may approve or deny the application and may impose such conditions relating to the use for which a special exception is granted as it may deem necessary in the public interest and may require a guarantee or bond to ensure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. 
(e)  The board shall be authorized to hear and decide only those special exceptions listed below:

(b)  Upon the presentation of such petition, the court shall allow a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the board and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return must be made and served upon the appellant's attorney. Such time shall not be less than ten (10) days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings from which the decision appealed. The court may grant a restraining order subject to proper application, notice to the board, all based on due cause. 
(c)  The board shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified. 
(d)  If, upon hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a commissioner to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. 
(e)  In the case of an appeal from the board to the circuit court of an order, requirement, decision or determination of a zoning administrator or other administrative officer in the administration or enforcement of any ordinance or provision of state law, the findings and conclusions of the board on questions of fact shall be presumed to be correct. The appealing party may rebut that presumption by proving by a preponderance of the evidence, including the record before the board, that the board erred in its decision. Any party may introduce evidence in the proceedings in the court. The court shall hear any argument on questions of law de novo. 
(f)  In the case of an appeal by a person of any decision of the board that denied or granted an application for a variance, exception to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation requirements, or application for a special exception, the decision of the board shall be presumed to be correct. The petitioner may rebut that presumption by showing to the satisfaction of the court that the board applied erroneous principles of law, or where the discretion of the board is involved, the decision of the board was plainly wrong and in violation of the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance, or Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance, where applicable. 
(g)  Costs shall not be allowed against the board, unless it shall appear to the court that it acted in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from. In the event the decision of the board is affirmed and the court finds that the appeal was frivolous, the court may order the person or persons who requested the issuance of the writ of certiorari to pay the costs incurred in making the return of the record pursuant to the writ of certiorari. If the petition is withdrawn subsequent to the filing of the return, the board may request that the court hear the matter on the question of whether the appeal was frivolous.

If the violation is uncorrected at the time of the conviction, the court shall order the violator to abate or remedy the violation in compliance with the zoning ordinance, within a time period established by the court. Failure to remove or abate a zoning violation within the specified time period shall constitute a separate misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and any such failure during any succeeding ten-day period shall constitute a separate misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00); any such failure during any succeeding ten-day period shall constitute a separate misdemeanor offense for each ten-day period punishable by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00).

Each day during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. However, specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not be charged more frequently than once in any ten-day period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00). Utilization of the civil penalty provided by this subsection shall preclude criminal sanctions for the same offense. 
(e)  In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this chapter, in addition to other remedies, the zoning administrator may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation to prevent the occupancy of the buildings, structure or land or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about the premises.

4-01.7.  Payments by subdividers and developers for certain off-site sewerage and drainage facilities. Subdividers or developers of land may be required to pay a pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary sewerage and drainage facilities, located outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by them but necessitated or required, at least in part, by the construction or improvement of their subdivision or development. Such payments shall not be required until such time as city council or a department designated by city council shall have established a general sewerage and/or drainage improvement program for an area having related and common sewer or drainage conditions and within which is located the land owned or controlled by the subdivider or developer. 
(1)  Payments shall be required only after establishment of regulations approved by city council which set forth reasonable standards to determine the proportionate share of total estimated cost of ultimate sewerage and drainage facilities required adequately to serve a related and common area, when and if totally developed in accord with the adopted comprehensive plan, that shall be borne by each subdivider or developer within the area. Such share shall be limited to the amount necessary to protect water quality based upon the pollutant loading caused by the subdivision or development or to the proportion of such total estimated cost which the increased sewerage flow, water flow and/or increased volume and velocity of stormwater runoff to be actually caused by his subdivision or development bears to total estimated volume and velocity of such sewerage, water and/or runoff from such area in its totally developed state. In calculating the pollutant loading caused by the subdivision or development or the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff, the city shall take into account the effect of all on-site stormwater facilities or best management practices constructed or required to be constructed by the subdivider or developer and give appropriate credit therefore. 
(2)  The regulations required above shall include a provision that payments received by the city shall be expended only for construction of those facilities for which the payment was required, and until so expended shall be held in an interest-bearing account for the benefit of the developer or subdivider. The regulations may allow, however, for the posting of personal, corporate, or property bond, cash escrow or other method of performance guarantee conditioned on payment at commencement of construction. 
4-01.8.  Court partition. If the partition of any tract is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction when a bona fide dispute exists between the parties in interest, none of the requirements of this ordinance shall apply.

4-01.11.  Conflict with Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance. Any provision of Chapter 13.5, Chesapeake Bay Preservation, which is found to be in conflict with any provision of this ordinance shall be controlling and shall supersede said provision of this ordinance to the extent of such conflict. 
4-01.12.  Subdivisions approved by subdivision review board. Any subdivision for which relief from strict compliance with the provisions of this ordinance was granted by the subdivision review board on or before December 31, 2018, shall be deemed in compliance in all respects with this ordinance. 
4-01.13.  No ingress and egress over landscaped areas of subdivision entrances. No curb cut, nor other improvement, shall be allowed for ingress and egress over landscaped areas of the entrances to subdivisions, which either now exist or are to be dedicated and created in the future, where these landscaped areas are specifically designed or used for aesthetic enhancements to the public rights-of-way and for future expansion of the paved portion of the streets they abut.

The preliminary development plan may be required to conform with the city's comprehensive plan and with accepted principles of subdivision design. If approval of a feature or features of the preliminary development plan by a state agency is necessary, the director shall forward the preliminary development plan to the appropriate state agency or agencies for review within ten (10) business days of receipt of such preliminary development plan.

The subdivider shall have not more than twelve (12) months from the date of preliminary development plan approval to record such plats.

8-01.6.  Reserved tracts. The owners of a subdivision may designate parcels of land for the common use of the owners of property within the subdivision for recreational use or permanently reserved open spaces, provided: 
(1)  The amount designated is sufficient in size, suitably located, has adequate access and is served with adequate facilities necessary to serve the recreational purpose intended; 
(2)  That no parcel shall be thus designated unless it contains at least the minimum area for a residential lot as established for the zoning district in which such lot is located; and 
(3)  That evidence is given that satisfactory arrangements will be made for the perpetual maintenance of such designated parcels to relieve the city of the future maintenance. 
8-01.7.  (Reserved). 
8-01.8.  Double frontage lots. Double frontage or reverse frontage lots shall not be permitted except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major thoroughfares or to overcome disadvantages of topography or where access to one (1) of the streets is restricted by fencing, planting or other appropriate screening.

ARTICLE XII. - VACATION OF PLAT 
 
Sec. 12-01. - Procedure before sale of lot. 
Any time before building construction has progressed to the point that vacation of the plat would place the land and buildings in violation of this or any other ordinance of the city, any plat, or part thereof, recorded in compliance with this ordinance may be vacated with the consent of the city manager, by owners, proprietors and trustees, if any, who signed the statement required in section 7-02.6 at any time before the sale of any lot therein by a written instrument declaring the same to be vacated, duly executed, acknowledged or proved or recorded in the office of the clerk of [the] circuit court wherein the plat to be vacated is recorded. The execution and recordation of such writing shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated and to divest all public rights in, and reinvest such owners, proprietors and trustees, if any, with the title to the streets, alleys, easements, and public areas laid out or described in such plat. 
To determine whether or not vacation would result in a violation, the buildings, if any, on the original tract of land shall be counted and those buildings constructed in the platted area shall be counted also. 
The intent and purpose of this section is to allow vacation of a plat or part thereof only in those cases where reversion of the land to its original size and shape will not place such land and buildings, including all buildings on the land, in such position that a violation of any city ordinance would exist had the plat never been prepared, approved and recorded. 
State Law reference Similar provisions, Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2271.  
Sec. 12-02. - Procedure after sale of lot.

(a)  By instrument in writing agreeing to said vacation signed by all the owners of lots shown on said plat and also signed on behalf of the City of Newport News by the city manager for the purpose of showing the approval of such vacation by the city council. The word "owners" shall not include lien creditors except those whose debts are secured by a recorded deed of trust or mortgage and shall not include any consort of an owner. The instrument of vacation shall be acknowledged in the manner of a deed and filed for record in the clerk's office of any court in which said plat is recorded. 
(b)  By ordinance of the Newport News city council on motion of one (1) of its members or on application of any interested person. Such ordinance shall not be adopted until after notice has been given as required by section 15.1-431, Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. Said notice shall clearly describe the plat or portion thereof to be vacated and state the time and place of the meeting of the governing body at which the adoption of the ordinance will be voted upon. Any person may appear at said meeting for the purpose of objecting to the adoption of the ordinance. An appeal from the adoption of the ordinance may be filed within thirty (30) days with the circuit court having jurisdiction of the land shown on the plat or part thereof to be vacated. Upon such appeal the court may nullify the ordinance if it finds that the owner of any lot shown on the plat will be irreparably damaged. If no appeal from the adoption of the ordinance is filed within the time above provided, the ordinance shall be amenable to appeal.
