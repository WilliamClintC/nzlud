PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of 
Tomball, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code, as supplemented, and 
ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the 
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the 
section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative 
tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as 
supplemented, any section of the 1993 Code, as supplemented and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Nicole C. 
Fluitt, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Doris Speer, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance 
during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher 
have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all 
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before June 16, 2014, 
and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance 
or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any 
provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be 
punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), except for: 
(1) ?violations of municipal ordinances that govern fire, safety, zoning, public health and sanitation, 
including dumping of refuse, vegetation and litter violations, in which the maximum fine shall be 
two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each offense; and 
(2) ?violations of traffic laws which are punishable as a Class C misdemeanor shall be punished by

    However, no penalty shall be greater or less than the penalty provided for the same or similar

    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the 
intention of the City Council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in 
the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section 6. Ordinances adopted after June 16, 2014 that amend or refer to ordinances that have 
been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
    Section 7. In the event any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase, provision, sentence, or 
part of this Ordinance or the application of the same to any person or circumstance shall for any reason 
be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall not affect, impair, 
or invalidate this Ordinance as a whole or any part of provision hereof other than the part declared to be 
invalid or unconstitutional; and the City Council of the City of Tomball, Texas, declares that it would have 
passed each and every part of the same notwithstanding the omission of any such part thus declared to 
be invalid or unconstitutional, or whether there be one or more parts. 
    Section 8. The City Secretary of the City of Tomball, Texas, is hereby directed to publish this 
Ordinance in the official newspaper of the City of Tomball, Texas, in compliance with the provisions of

are inconsistent or in conflict with this Ordinance. 
    The provisions of this Ordinance shall be included and incorporated in the Code of Ordinances of the 
City of Tomball, Texas, as an amendment thereto, and shall be appropriately renumbered to conform to

under this Charter. 
(Rev. of 5-6-1995) 


Sec. 9.03. - Right of regulation. 
    Every grant, renewal, extension or amendment of a public utility franchise, whether so provided in

A. ?To forfeit any such franchise by ordinance at any time for failure of the holder thereof to comply 
with the terms of the franchise. Such power shall be exercised only after written notice to the 
franchise holder stating wherein the franchise holder has failed to comply with the terms of the 
franchise and setting a reasonable time for the correction of such failure, and shall be exercised 
after such reasonable time has expired. 
B. ?To impose reasonable regulations to insure safe, efficient and continuous service to the public. 
C. ?To require such expansion, extension, enlargement and improvement of plants and facilities as 
are necessary to provide adequate service to the public. 
D. ?To require every franchise holder to furnish to the City, without cost to the City, full information 
regarding the location, character, size, length and terminals of all facilities of such franchise 
holder in, over and under the streets, alleys and other public properties of the City, and to 
regulate and control the location, relocation and removal of such facilities. 
E. ?To collect from every public utility operating in the City such proportion of the expense of 
excavating, grading, paving, repaving, constructing, reconstructing, draining, repairing, 
maintaining, lighting, sweeping and sprinkling the streets, alleys, bridges, culverts, viaducts and 
other public places of the City which represent the increased cost of such operation resulting 
from the occupancy of such public places by such public utility, and such proportion of that cost 
of such operations as results from the damage to or the disturbance of such public places 
caused by such public utility; or to compel such public utility to perform, at its own expense, 
such operations as above listed which are made necessary by the occupancy of such public 
places by such utility or by damage to or disturbance of such public places caused by such 
public utility. 
F. ?To require every franchise holder to allow other public utilities to use its poles and other 
facilities, including bridges and viaducts, whenever in the judgment of the Council such use 
shall be in the public interest, provided that in such an event, a reasonable rental shall be paid 
such owner of the facilities for such use. Provided further, that inability of such public utilities to 
agree upon rental facilities shall not be an excuse for failure to comply with such requirement by 
the Council. 
G. ?To require the keeping of accounts in such form as will accurately reflect the value of the 
property of each franchise holder which is used and useful in rendering its service to the public 
and the expenses, receipts and profits of all kind of such franchise holder. 
H. ?To examine and audit at any time during business hours the accounts and other records of any 
franchise holder. 
I. ?To require reports on the operation of the utility, which shall be in such form and contain such 
information as the Council shall prescribe. 
J. ?To require that the public utility give notice to any subscriber to its service prior to the permanent 
or temporary discontinuance or disruption of such service by the public utility, except in cases of 
emergency, and to require that no officer, agent, servant or employee of the public utility nor 
any vehicles or equipment under their control shall make use of, go upon or across any private 
property in the City without first obtaining the permission of the owner or occupant of such 
property, except in cases of emergency, and to provide a penalty for the violation of such 
requirements. 
K. ?To impose such other reasonable regulations, restrictions, requirements and conditions as may 
be deemed necessary or desirable to promote the health, safety, welfare or accommodations of 
the public. 
L. ?No franchise shall be transferable except with the approval of the Council as expressed by 
ordinance. The term "transferable", as used herein, shall not be construed in such a manner as 
to prevent the franchise from pledging said franchise as security for a valid debt or mortgage. 
(Rev. of 5-6-1995) 


Sec. 9.04. - Grant not to be exclusive. 
    No grant of franchise to construct, maintain or operate a public utility and no renewal or extension of 
such grant shall be exclusive. 
(Rev. of 5-6-1995) 


Sec. 9.05. - Other conditions.

utility property is in all things reserved, and except the general power of the City heretofore existing and 
herein provided for to regulate the rates and services of a utility, which shall include the right to require 
adequate and reasonable quality of utility service to the public. Every public utility franchise hereafter 
granted shall be held subject to all the terms and conditions contained in the various sections of this 
Article whether or not such terms are specifically mentioned in the franchises. Nothing in this Charter shall 
operate to limit in any way, as specifically stated, the discretion of the Council or the voters of the City in 
imposing terms and conditions as may be reasonable in connection with any franchise grant, including 
the right to require such compensation or rental as may be permitted by the laws of the State of Texas 
and the United States of America. 
(Rev. of 5-6-1995) 


Sec. 9.06. - Accounts of municipally-owned utilities. 
    Accounts shall be kept for each public utility owned or operated by the City in such manner as to 
show the true and complete financial results of such City ownership and operation, including all assets 
and all liabilities, appropriately subdivided by classes, depreciation reserve, other reserves and surplus; 
also revenues, operating expenses including depreciation, interest payment, rental and other disposition 
of annual income, the accounts shall show actual capital cost to the City of each public utility owned; the 
cost of all extensions, additions and improvements and the source of funds expended for such capital 
purposes. They shall show as nearly as possible the cost of any service furnished to or rendered by any 
such utility to any City Government Department. The Council shall cause an annual report to be made by 
a Certified Public Accountant giving the information specified in this section and such other data as the 
Council shall deem expedient.

services, inspect the same and require such materials to be kept in good order and condition at 
all times, make such rules and regulations as shall be necessary and proper and prescribe 
penalties for noncompliance with same. 
(Rev. of 5-6-1995) 


Sec. 9.08. - Regulation of rates and utilities. 
    The Council shall have full power, after notice and hearing, to regulate by ordinance, subject to 
Federal and State laws, the rates of every public utility operating in the City provided that no such 
ordinance shall be passed as an emergency measure. The City shall have power to employ, at the 
expense of the Grantee, expert assistance and advice in determining a reasonable rate and equitable 
profit to the Grantee. This Charter does not revoke any existing City Ordinance that has waived the right 
of rate regulation by the City to the Public Utility Commission of the State of Texas.

permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and 
referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. 
The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, 
where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new 
pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the 
date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b) ?In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be

(c) ?When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person, agency or 
organization authorized to prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in 
ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to 
embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1) ?Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2) ?Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the 
Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3) ?Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, 
where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision 
numbers; 
(4) ?Change the term "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," 
"this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " 
(inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive 
sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5) ?Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance 
sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the 
meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the 
Code. 
(d) ?The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be 
prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent 
ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new code of ordinances by the city council. 
(Code 1978, §§ 2-108, 2-113; Code 1993, § 1-11) 


Sec. 1-12. - Police power extended to city property. 
    The police power of the city is hereby extended to include all lands or property owned or leased by 
the city or any agency of the city and the general ordinances of the city shall be applicable on such 
property. 
(Code 1978, § 1-8; Code 1993, § 1-12) 


Sec. 1-13. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion 
of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any 
manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby; provided that 
supplementation of this Code by authorized persons shall be permitted. 
(Code 1978, § 1-9; Code 1993, § 1-13) 


Sec. 1-14. - General penalty for violations of Code; continuing violations. 
(a) ?Whenever in this Code or any other ordinance of the city, an act is prohibited or is made or declared 
to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or wherever in such Code or ordinance the doing of 
an act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is 
provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be 
punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00, except for: 
(1) ?Violations of municipal ordinances that govern fire, safety, zoning, public health and sanitation, 
including dumping of refuse, vegetation and litter violations in which the maximum fine shall be 
$2,000.00 for each offense; and 
(2) ?Violations of traffic laws which are punishable as a Class C misdemeanor shall be punished by 
a fine not to exceed $200.00. 
However, no penalty shall be greater or less than the penalty provided for the same or similar offense

(b) ?Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate

purposes. If any violation of this Code is designated as a nuisance under the provisions of this Code, 
such nuisance may be summarily abated by the city in addition to the imposition of a fine or 
imprisonment. 
(c) ?Unless otherwise specifically stated within the provisions of this Code, any violation of this Code or 
of any ordinance set forth herein that is punishable by a fine that does not exceed $500.00 does not 
require a culpable mental state, and a culpable mental state is hereby not required to prove any such 
offense. 
(d) ?Unless otherwise specifically stated within the provisions of this Code, any violation of this Code or 
of any ordinance set forth herein that is punishable by a fine that exceeds $500.00 shall require a 
culpable mental state of intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence engaging in 
conduct constituting the violation. 
(e) ?In any prosecution in the municipal court of the city or of any other court of competent jurisdiction, a 
complaint charging a violation of this Code need not negate the existence of any affirmative defense 
but the existence of such may be raised by the defendant in any such prosecution by way of defense 
as provided in the Texas Penal Code. 
(f) ?A complaint charging a violation of any provision of this Code in the municipal court of the city or any 
other court of competent jurisdiction need not negative the existence of any exception but the 
existence of the same may be raised by the defendant in such prosecution by way of defense. 
(g) ?The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not prevent the revocation or 
suspension of any license, franchise or permit issued or granted under the provisions of this Code. 
(h) ?The city council shall have the power to remit, in whole or in part and upon such conditions as may 
be deemed proper, by vote of two-thirds of the members present, any fine or penalty belonging to the

Sec. 2-21. - Removal. 
    Any member of the city council may be expelled or removed from office in the manner prescribed by 
law by the concurrent vote of two-thirds of all the members elected. 
(Code 1978, § 2-30; Code 1993, § 2-31) 


Sec. 2-22. - Rules of procedure. 
(a) ?Adopted. The following rules of procedure (the "rules") are adopted by the city council (the "council") 
in accordance with section 6.13 of the city Charter. These rules shall govern all meetings and 
proceedings of the city council, the order of business, and the conduct of city councilmembers and 
persons in attendance at such meetings. Additionally, these principles, parliamentary procedures 
and rules for citizen participation shall be adhered to by all city commissions, boards and 
committees, to the extent such rules of procedure are not inconsistent with the public business to be 
conducted by such a body. 
(b) ?Purpose and guiding principles. These rules are simple and meant to be kept simple. Strict technical 
rules tend to impede rather than advance the legislative process. Reason, common sense and 
cooperation must prevail in the conduct of city business. Dissent and debate are essential and 
beneficial elements of our system of free and open government, but rules should not be used to 
hinder the process, however the ultimate outcome is viewed by an individual or group. 
(c) ?Meetings. The following types of meetings may be held: 
(1) ?Regular meetings. In accordance with section 6.12 of the city Charter, the council shall conduct 
regular meetings on the first and third Mondays of each month. Whenever a regular meeting 
date falls on a holiday observed by the city, such regular meeting shall be scheduled and held 
on the next calendar day which is not a holiday observed by the city, unless the council takes 
action in advance, by resolution or ordinance, to reschedule such meeting. 
a. ?All regular meetings shall begin promptly at 6:00 p.m. (See special/workshop meetings in 
subsection (2) and (3) of this section. 
b. ?Regular meetings shall be held at the city hall as required by the Charter, unless the city 
council votes to approve a location other than the city hall in the public interest. 
(2) ?Special meetings. In accordance with section 6.12 of the Charter, additional special meetings 
may be called upon written request of the mayor or any three councilmembers. If a majority of 
the city councilmembers at a public meeting request a subsequent special meeting, a special 
meeting shall be scheduled at the earliest practical time as requested. The council meeting 
minutes reflecting the request to call a special meeting shall also reflect the scheduled date and 
time of such special meeting. 
a. ?Special meetings may be called to address and act on matters which should not be 
delayed until a regular meeting. 
b. ?Special meetings shall be called to begin promptly at the time designated, unless 
circumstances reasonably require a different starting time, in which event the 
circumstances shall be stated on the meeting agenda. 
c. ?Except in unusual circumstances, which shall be stated on the meeting agenda, special 
meetings will be held at the city hall. 
(3) ?Workshop meetings. In accordance with section 6.12 of the Charter, additional workshop 
meetings may be called upon written request of the mayor or any three councilmembers. If a 
majority of the city councilmembers at a public meeting request a subsequent workshop 
meeting, a workshop meeting shall be scheduled at the earliest practical time as requested. The 
council meeting minutes reflecting the request to call a workshop meeting shall also reflect the 
scheduled date and time of such workshop meeting. 
a. ?The purpose of a workshop meeting is to give council the opportunity to discuss in depth or 
explore in detail subjects of interest to the city. 
b. ?No action items shall be placed on the agenda for a workshop meeting. 
c. ?Workshop meetings shall begin promptly at the time designated and may precede a regular 
or special meeting. If circumstances reasonably require a different starting time or a 
different date, such circumstances shall be stated on the meeting agenda. 
d. ?As circumstances require, public hearings may be held at workshop meetings for the 
convenience of the public. 
e. ?Except in unusual circumstances, which shall be stated on the meeting agenda, workshop 
meetings will be held at the city hall. 
(4) ?Public meetings; executive sessions. All meetings of the city council are open to the public, in 
compliance with the Texas Open Meetings Act. Further, the city council may conduct executive 
sessions in compliance with the Texas Open Meetings Act. 
(d) ?Agenda. The following provisions shall apply: 
(1) ?Items on the agenda. An item may be placed on the agenda by the mayor or city manager. The 
city manager, working in conjunction with the mayor, will exercise their best judgment in 
determining what other items of city business should come before the council. City staff seeking 
to have an item placed on an agenda shall submit that item to the city manager's office for 
approval. If two or more of the city councilmembers make a request in writing that an agenda 
item be placed on the agenda for any subsequent meeting, then such item shall be placed on 
the agenda for discussion and/or action as requested. A city councilmember, in accordance with 
V.T.C.A., Government Code § 551.042, may propose an item for inclusion on the agenda for a 
subsequent meeting, and any deliberation or decision on such item shall be limited to the 
proposal to place the item on the agenda. 
(2) ?Submission of items and backup materials. Items to be placed on the agenda, including the 
materials to be distributed to council in connection with the items, must reach the city 
secretary's office at the city hall before 12:00 noon on the Wednesday of the week preceding 
the council meeting. 
(3) ?Packets. The agenda packets for all regular meetings will be available in city hall after 4:00 
p.m. on Thursday preceding the Monday meetings. This should afford ample time for all 
councilmembers to inquire into the nature of each matter to be discussed. 
(4) ?Notice to media. The city secretary's office will assume responsibility for issuing to 
newspapers, radio and television stations, which have requested such notification, a copy of the 
agenda advising them that the regular meeting will be held on the following night. The city 
secretary's office will also assume the responsibility for compliance with the open meetings law. 
(5) ?Consideration limited to agenda items. Except for discussions pertaining to announcements or 
to requests to have items placed on a subsequent agenda, the council will restrict consideration 
only to the item or items on the current agenda. 
(6) ?Organization and order of agenda. The following order shall be followed: 
a. ?Call to order/roll call. 
b. ?Pledges of allegiance and invocation. 
c. ?Public comments and receipt of petitions. Citizens desiring to be heard will be given the 
opportunity. Petitions will be received. (See rules for "citizen participation at meetings" in 
subsection (i) of this section.) 
d. ?Presentations. 
e. ?Reports and announcements. 
f. ?Approval of minutes. 
g. ?Old business, by item, discussion/action. Final passage of ordinances and other business 
pending from a previous council meeting. 
h. ?New business consent agenda; items requiring little or no discussion. If one or more 
members of council desire to remove an item from the consent agenda, such items shall 
be considered and acted upon separately (placed before new business). 
i. ?New business, by item, discussion/action. New ordinances, resolutions, budget 
amendments and changes, bid openings and bid awards, contracts, policies and other 
matters to be considered and/or acted upon. New business shall include all public bid 
openings. 
j. ?Executive session. 
k. ?Adjournment. 
(e) ?Council proceedings. In accordance with section 6.13 of the Charter, four councilmembers, one of 
whom may be the mayor, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transaction of business and no 
action of the council shall be valid or binding unless adopted by the affirmative vote of three or more 
members of the council. 
(f) ?Parliamentary procedure. In all council meetings, the following commonly used rules of 
parliamentary procedure will be followed. In the event that conflict results in gridlock, and reasonable 
compromise fails to move the council forward in the conduct of city business, then Robert's Rules of 
Order, Newly Revised will be followed as necessary. The rules are as follows: 
(1) ?Questions to contain one subject. All questions (motions) submitted for a vote shall contain 
only one subject. If a question contains two or more points under one subject, any member may 
require a division, if the question reasonably admits of a division. 
(2) ?Main motion. A subject is introduced by a main motion. Once seconded, no other topics should 
be taken up until after the motion is disposed of. 
(3) ?Second. Any motion requires a second or it dies for lack of a second. 
(4) ?Motion to amend. This motion is used when the intention is to change, add or omit some part of 
a main motion. This motion is debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present 
for passage. A motion to amend is not amendable. First, a vote is held on the motion to amend. 
If that vote is affirmative, the second vote is held on the main motion as amended. 
(5) ?Motion to table or postpone to a certain time. This motion would require that consideration of a 
main motion be delayed until a certain, stated time for, among other reasons, to obtain more 
information. A future date certain should be set when the subject would be considered. This 
motion is debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. 
(6) ?Motion to table indefinitely. This motion postpones consideration of the main motion in such a 
way that the issue being discussed may be taken up at an unspecified, later date when a 
majority of the members present vote to "call it from the table." This motion is not debatable and 
requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. 
(7) ?Motion to move the question or call the question. This motion is made to end discussion that 
has become lengthy or repetitious. When seconded, the presiding officer immediately moves or 
calls the vote on the question of closing the discussion. This motion is not debatable and 
requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. 
(8) ?Motion to reconsider. A vote may be reconsidered during the same meeting on motion made by 
a member who voted on the prevailing (winning) side of the issue. This motion is debatable and 
requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. First a vote is held on the motion 
to reconsider. If that vote is affirmative, the second vote is held on the issue to be reconsidered. 
(9) ?Reconsideration of a subject when defeated. When an ordinance, resolution, motion or other 
measure has been placed on the agenda, voted on and defeated, the same question shall not 
again be placed on the agenda for a subsequent meeting to be considered by the council until a 
lapse of 90 days, unless a majority of council present vote, at a public meeting, that the 
question be placed on the agenda of a subsequent meeting, stating the date. 
(10) ?Suspension of rules; order of agenda. Consistent with state law and the Charter, any one or 
all of these rules of procedure may be suspended in order to allow a particular consideration of 
a subject or matter, provided a majority of the members present vote in favor of such 
suspension; provided further, the order of business on the agenda may also be suspended by 
such a majority vote. This motion is debatable. 
(11) ?Vote. The presiding officer shall call for a vote by requesting "all in favor say aye" and "all 
opposed say nay." The presiding officer or any other member may request a roll call vote at any 
time, including immediately after a voice vote. Except for the "majority vote of the members 
present" provided for in applying these procedural rules, any action by council shall require the 
affirmative vote of three or more members of the council (the mayor has a binding vote only in 
the case of a tie), in accordance with section 6.13 of the Charter. A councilmember shall state 
the reason for an abstaining vote, in accordance with section 6.13 of the Charter. 
(12) ?Frivolous or delaying motions. The presiding officer shall not entertain any motion which is 
frivolous or clearly made for the purpose of delay. In the event a conflict develops, any member 
may call for a vote (majority of the members present) to consider the matter or to move along. 
(13) ?Point of order. A point of order can be raised at any time and supersedes any issue being 
discussed at the time. A member who believes the rules are not being followed may use this 
mechanism to call attention to the problem. The presiding officer must rule on the point of order 
before proceeding. 
(14) ?Questions and inquiries. A member may ask about correct procedures, ask for facts, ask to 
speed things along, for a recess for comfort and convenience, or other relevant questions and 
inquiries. The presiding officer responds to the question or refers it to the proper person. 
(15) ?Limit debate. The council may agree to limit debate on any subject before it is discussed or 
debated. The agreement should be formalized by majority vote of the members present. 
(16) ?Recessed meetings. Recessing a meeting is not a favored practice. However, if 
circumstances require, any meeting of the council may be recessed to a later time, provided 
that no recess shall be for a longer period than until the next scheduled meeting. Prior to the 
recess the presiding officer shall announce the time, date and subjects of the meeting to be 
reconvened. A new agenda shall be posted for the reconvened meeting, making clear reference 
to the recessed meeting. The presiding officer may declare the meeting recessed without 
waiting for a motion. A member may move to recess under the same conditions. When the 
meeting is recessed, the meeting is immediately halted. The motion by a member is not 
debatable and a majority vote of the members present is required for passage. 
(17) ?Motion to adjourn. If the time set for adjournment has arrived or if there is no further business, 
the presiding officer may declare the meeting recessed without waiting for a motion. A member 
may move to recess under the same conditions. When the meeting is recessed, the meeting is 
immediately halted. The motion by a member is not debatable and a majority vote of the 
members present is required for passage. 
(18) ?Procedural summary. The following summary of these procedural rules is included for ease of 
reference. In the event of an interpretation conflict between this summary and the narrative 
provisions of these procedural rules, the narrative procedural rules shall control.

(g) ?City councilmembers decorum and debate. When a measure is presented for consideration to the 
council, the presiding officer shall recognize the appropriate individual to present the matter. When 
two or more members wish to speak, the presiding officer shall name the member who is to speak 
first. No member of the council shall interrupt another while speaking, except to make a point of 
order. The presiding officer shall not be obligated to recognize any councilmember for a second 
comment on the subject or amendment until every councilmember wishing to speak has been 
allowed a first comment. Councilmembers shall also have the right to yield the floor to another 
member. 
(1) ?Councilmembers should not indulge in personal attacks, use personally offensive language, 
arraign motives of councilmembers or staff, charge deliberate misrepresentation, or use 
language tending to hold a member of the city council or staff up to contempt. 
(2) ?If a member is transgressing the rules of the council, the presiding officer shall, or any 
councilmember may, call him to order, in which case he shall immediately be quiet unless 
permitted to explain. The council shall, if appealed to, decide the matter by majority vote of the 
members present without debate. If the decision is in favor of the member called to order, he 
shall then be at liberty to proceed, but not otherwise, in compliance with these rules. 
(h) ?Duties of mayor or presiding officer. At all meetings, it is the responsibility of the presiding officer to 
use the rules of procedure appropriately so that good order and reasonable decorum are maintained 
and the business of the meeting goes forward. The presiding officer's duties include: 
(1) ?Calling the meeting to order at the time set. 
(2) ?Following the agenda and clarifying to the members what is being voted on at all times. 
(3) ?Ensuring that the rules and procedures for the conduct of meetings are followed. 
(4) ?Dealing firmly with whispers, commotion, disruptions and frivolous motions. 
(5) ?Ensuring that debate is confined to the merits of the question and that personal comments are 
avoided. 
(6) ?Ensuring that the rules for citizen participation are followed. 
(7) ?Remaining calm and dealing fairly with all sides of an issue, regardless of personal opinion. 
(8) ?Ensuring that city business is handled expeditiously during council meetings. 
(i) ?Citizens' participation at meetings. Rules for speakers: 
(1) ?Recognition. Citizens will be allowed to speak at a meeting; however, before a member of the 
public may address city council or speak at a meeting, the presiding officer must first recognize 
the member of the public who wishes to speak and announce that the person may proceed. 
(2) ?Time limit. The presiding officer, or the city council by majority vote of the councilmembers 
present, may set a reasonable time limit for any citizen or person in attendance who desires to 
address the council or speak at a meeting. 
(3) ?Identification. All members of the public speaking before council shall preface their statements 
with their name and home address for the record. 
(4) ?Speaking from the podium. All speakers must come to the podium, unless the presiding officer 
permits speakers to make their statements from their seat in the meeting room. 
(5) ?Spokesperson. Speakers with similar or common interests are encouraged to select someone 
to act as a spokesperson in order to move the proceedings along. The presiding officer may 
urge the implementation of this rule at any time. 
(6) ?Public comments and receipt of petitions; public hearings. Any person desiring to be heard by 
the city council on any matter shall be heard during that part of the meeting reserved for public 
comments and receipt of petitions, or as scheduled for a public hearing. 
(7) ?Scheduled speakers. Speakers may request, in writing, an opportunity to be placed on the 
agenda to speak at a meeting concerning a specific matter, as identified in their written request. 
Written requests to be placed on the agenda to speak must be delivered to the city secretary, or 
the city secretary's designee, by 12:00 noon on Wednesday of the week preceding the regular, 
special or workshop meeting of the city council. In the event that the number of speakers who 
request to be scheduled on the agenda indicates that the comments will be lengthy or 
repetitious, the presiding officer may schedule such matter for a public hearing or make other 
appropriate arrangements to ensure that the conduct of the city's business is not unduly 
impeded. 
(8) ?Speaking during consideration of agenda items. The presiding officer at his own discretion, or 
by majority vote of the councilmembers present, may recognize a person or persons in 
attendance and allow such persons to speak prior to consideration and discussion of an agenda 
item by the city council. Any further discussion of the same matter shall likewise be at the 
discretion of the presiding officer, or by majority vote of councilmembers present. 
(9) ?Rules not to restrict the city. These rules for speakers will not be construed or applied in such a 
manner that they restrict the ability of the mayor, or the city council by majority vote of the 
members present, to reasonably limit or expand the debate and discussion of any item, when 
necessary in the city's best interest.

Such a defense, if authorized by city council, shall be in accordance with all the requirements and 
provisions of this chapter, including the determination of eligibility. 
(c) ?Legal counsel. Defense provided under this section shall be undertaken by the legal counsel chosen

eligibility shall be determined by reference to state law.

defense of a claim or lawsuit, and for which coverage under this article was refused based on a 
determination by legal counsel of ineligibility as provided in this section, it shall be deemed to be 
a determination that such covered person has met the eligibility requirements of this article, and 
accordingly, such covered person shall be entitled to reimbursement by the city only for 
reasonable expenses of defense shown to be incurred on the covered person's behalf. This 
provision shall not affect the continued applicability of the exclusions which preclude coverage. 
The determination by the city council of such reasonable expenses shall be final.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 


Sec. 10-390. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has in the Flood Control Insurance Act and Texas Water Code (including 
V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315) delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt 
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-1), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-391. - Findings of fact. 
(a) ?The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and 
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and 
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of 
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b) ?These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, which 
increase flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable 
to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, or otherwise 
protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-2), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-2), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-392. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to 
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1) ?Protect human life and health; 
(2) ?Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3) ?Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4) ?Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5) ?Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6) ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of the flood-
prone area in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7) ?Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood-prone area; and 
(8) ?Ensure that those who occupy the flood-prone area assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-3), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-3), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-393. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1) ?Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood, or 
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2) ?Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3) ?Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, 
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4) ?Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
and 
(5) ?Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or 
may increase flood hazards in other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-4), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-4), 10-4-2010)

or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the 
market value of the structure either: 
a. ?Before "start of construction" of the improvement or repair; or 
b. ?If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For 
the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur 
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building 
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
(2) ?The term "substantial improvement" includes repetitive loss, as defined in this section; 
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed, but does not include either: 
a. ?Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local

(e) ?Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any 
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another 
chapter, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more 
stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f) ?Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
(1) ?Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2) ?Liberally construed in favor of the city council; and 
(3) ?Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g) ?Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is 
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering 
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased 
by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the flood-prone areas or 
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not 
create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that 
result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

Sec. 10-420. - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
    The city engineer is hereby appointed floodplain administrator to administer and implement the 
provisions of this article and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (Emergency Management and 
Assistance-National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management by 
granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-27), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-27), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-421. - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1) ?Permit review. 
a. ?Review all development permit applications to determine that the requirements of this 
article have been satisfied. 
b. ?Review all development permit applications to determine that all necessary permits have 
been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies (including section 
404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1344) from 
which prior approval is required. 
c. ?Review all development permit applications to determine if the proposed development is 
located in the regulatory floodway. If located in the regulatory floodway, assure that the 
encroachment provisions of section 10-448 are met. 
d. ?Review all development permit applications to ensure that the proposed building site 
projects, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from 
flooding. 
(2) ?Use of other base flood data (in A Zones). When base flood elevation data has not been 
provided in accordance with section 10-395(b), obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base 
flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to 
administer sections 10-446, and 10-448, floodways. 
(3) ?Information to be obtained and maintained. 
a. ?Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or 
required as in subsection (2) of this section, obtain and record the actual elevation (in 
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or 
substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. 
b. ?For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures where base flood elevation 
data is provided through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or as required in subsection (2) 
of this section: 
1. ?Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level); and 
2. ?Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in section 10-419(c)(6). 
c. ?Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this article. 
(4) ?Alteration of watercourses. 
a. ?Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating agency which 
is the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and also the state commission on 
environmental quality prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit 
evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
b. ?Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said 
watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(5) ?FIRM boundaries. 
a. ?Interpretation. Make interpretations, where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries 
of the special flood hazard area (i.e., where there appears to be a conflict between a 
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the 
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided 
in section 10-423. 
b. ?Revision; encroachments. Under the provisions of 44 CFR 65.12 of the National Flood 
Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones 
A1-30, AE and AH on a community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of 
the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first completes all of the 
provisions required by said section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-28), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-28), 10-4-2010)

(a) ?Any person who is required or elects to obtain a plat shall also comply with the provisions of this 
article, if applicable. 
(b) ?When a person files an application for approval of a plat, the approval of the plat is subject to the 
approval of a drainage plan for the property that is the subject of the plat application if the property is 
located in whole or in part in a flood-prone area within the city. The drainage plan shall include the 
base flood elevation data for the property certified as true and correct on the face of the drainage 
plan by a registered professional engineer licensed in the state. 
(c) ?The city engineer shall review the drainage plan and determine whether the development will be 
reasonably safe from flooding and whether such proposed development is: 
(1) ?Consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area; 
(2) ?To be constructed so that all public utility facilities including, but not limited to, sanitary sewer, 
gas, water and electrical systems are located and constructed so as to minimize flood damage 
from the base flood; 
(3) ?To be constructed so that drainage is provided to reduce exposure of such development to 
flood hazards; and 
(4) ?Would comply with the applicable requirements of division 3 of this article. 
(d) ?If the proposed development satisfies the criteria in subsection (c) of this section, the city engineer 
shall approve the drainage plan and shall so notify the city planning and zoning commission in 
writing. 
(e) ?The city planning and zoning commission shall not approve a final plat until the city engineer has 
approved the drainage plan for that site. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-29), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-29), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-423. - Variance procedures. 
(a) ?Appeal board. 
(1) ?The appeals board, as established by the city council, shall hear and decide appeals and 
requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(2) ?The appeals board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any 
requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement 
or administration of this article. 
(3) ?In passing upon such applications, the appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations, 
all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
a. ?The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b. ?The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c. ?The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on the individual owner; 
d. ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e. ?The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f. ?The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to 
flooding or erosion damage; 
g. ?The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h. ?The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain 
management program for that area; 
i. ?The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j. ?The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the 
floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
k. ?The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and 
water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(4) ?Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (a)(3) of this section and the purposes of this 
article, the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems 
necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(5) ?The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any 
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(b) ?Conditions for variances. 
(1) ?Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on 
a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing 
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (a)(3)a. thru k. 
of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification 
required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2) ?Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without 
regard to the procedures set forth in this section. 
(3) ?Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels 
during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum 
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5) ?Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a. ?A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b. ?A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the 
applicant; 
c. ?A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, 
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause 
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection (a)(3) of this section, or 
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6) ?Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general 
zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property; they are not personal in 
nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. 
They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, 
variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 
(7) ?Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a 
lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined 
that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except 
subsection (b)(1) of this section, and otherwise complies with sections 10-445(a) and (b) of the 
general standards. 
(8) ?Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements 
and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided 
that: 
a. ?The criteria outlined in subsection (b) of this section are met; and 
b. ?The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages 
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(9) ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will 
be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the 
cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced 
lowest floor elevation. 
(c) ?Appeal of decision. All decisions of the appeals board are final and binding and may not be 
appealed to the city council. However, any person aggrieved by a decision of the appeals board may 
present a verified petition that states that the decision of board is illegal, in whole or in part, and 
specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition must be presented to a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction within ten calendar days after the date the board's decision is filed in the office of the 
secretary of the board. 
(d) ?Notice of decision. The secretary shall give notice of the decision and the right of appeal of the 
decision to each party personally, by mail or by email not later than the third day after the date of the 
decision.

DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 


Sec. 10-445. - General standards. 
    In the flood-prone area, the following standards are required: 
(1) ?Anchoring. 
a. ?All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and 
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure 
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy. 
b. ?All manufactured homes must likewise be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored 
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrostatic 
and hydrodynamic loads including the effects of buoyancy, and shall be installed using 
methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but 
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. (Reference FEMA's 
"Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas" guidebook for additional 
techniques.) 
(2) ?Site drainage. Drainage pathways are required around structures to guide floodwaters around 
such structures. 
(3) ?Construction materials and methods. 
a. ?All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and 
utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
b. ?All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and 
practices that minimize flood damage. 
c. ?All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, 
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities 
that are designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from 
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(4) ?Utilities. 
a. ?All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate 
infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
b. ?New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate 
infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; 
and 
c. ?On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or 
contamination from them during flooding. 
(5) ?Standards for subdivisions. 
a. ?All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and 
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b. ?All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured 
home parks and subdivisions, shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of 
this article; 
c. ?All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and 
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and 
water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; 
d. ?All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and 
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; 
and 
e. ?Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another 
authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed 
developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
(6) ?Review of building permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood 
insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source (section 10-421(2)), applications for 
building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe 
from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical 
data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at 
least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance 
rates. 
(7) ?Mitigation of fill. Fill in the flood-prone area must be mitigated to ensure that the storage volume 
of such area is not diminished by development. A development permit applicant must submit a 
fill mitigation analysis demonstrating that the proposed development, if constructed, will not 
result in a decrease in storage volume within the flood-prone area. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-41), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-41), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-446. - Specific standards. 
(a) ?Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure 
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least 1.5 feet above the base flood 
elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a FEMA elevation 
certificate to the floodplain administrator that verifies that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
(b) ?Nonresidential construction. 
(1) ?New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other 
nonresidential structure shall either meet the specific standards for residential construction, or, 
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a. ?Be floodproofed to at least 1.5 feet above the base flood level so that the structure is 
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b. ?Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and 
effects of buoyancy; 
c. ?Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods 
of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting 
provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural 
design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set 
forth in section 10-421(3)b.; 
(2) ?Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards 
for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (d) of this section; 
(3) ?Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings are advised that flood insurance premiums 
may be based on rates that are greater than those established for buildings with the first floor 
elevated to the same level. 
(c) ?Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside 
the limits of the flood-prone area. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the 
flood-prone area if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the 
flood-prone area shall have the lowest floor elevated, or the structure shall be floodproofed to an 
elevation at least 1.5 feet above the elevation of the 500-year (0.2 percent probability) flood event or 
three feet above the highest adjacent grade of the building site if flood elevation data is not available. 
Additionally, floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will 
not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access to and from the critical facility must be 
assured under all circumstances. The city engineer will review and approve all plans for access 
routes for critical facilities located in the flood-prone area. 
(d) ?Enclosures. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, 
or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing 
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by 
a professional engineer licensed in the state or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(1) ?A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every 
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(2) ?The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
(3) ?Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that 
they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4) ?Below-grade crawlspaces shall be designed in accordance with FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-
01, "Crawlspace Construction for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas," FIA-TB-11, 
or revisions to this document. 
(5) ?Below-grade crawlspaces are prohibited at sites where the velocity of floodwaters exceeds five 
feet per second. 
(6) ?All building utility systems within the crawlspace shall be elevated above base flood elevation 
or be designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system component 
during flood conditions. 
(7) ?The interior of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation must not be more than two feet 
below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG) and the height of the below-grade crawlspace, 
measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation 
must not exceed four feet at any point. 
(8) ?Below-grade crawlspaces constructed in accordance with the requirements listed in this 
subsection (d) shall not be considered basements. However, applicants who construct buildings 
that have below-grade crawlspaces are hereby advised that such buildings may have higher 
flood insurance premiums than buildings that have crawlspaces with interior elevations at or 
above the lowest adjacent grade. In addition, the building design must include adequate 
provision for drainage from the crawlspace following a flooding event. 
(e) ?Manufactured homes. 
(1) ?All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites: 
a. ?Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
b. ?In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
c. ?In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
d. ?In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has 
incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured 
home is elevated at 1.5 feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an 
adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
(2) ?Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision within the flood-prone area that are not subject to the 
above manufactured home provisions shall be elevated so that either: 
a. ?The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at 1.5 feet above the base flood 
elevation; or 
b. ?The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation 
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above 
grade and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist 
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(f) ?Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either: 
(1) ?Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
(2) ?Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the 
site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently 
attached additions; or 
(3) ?Meet the requirements of subsection (e) of this section and the elevation and anchoring 
requirements for manufactured homes. 
(g) ?Accessory structures. Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so 
as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters; shall be anchored to prevent floatation 
which may result in damage to other structures; and service utilities such as electrical and heating 
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed. 
(h) ?Breakaway walls. Breakaway walls must be designed so that if carried downstream they will not 
cause damage to any other structure. Breakaway walls must have a design safe loading resistance 
of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which 
exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so 
required by city or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer certifies 
that the proposed design meets the following conditions: 
(1) ?Wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base 
flood; and 
(2) ?The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to 
collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads 
acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind 
and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance 
of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

Sec. 10-447. - Before regulatory floodway. 
    In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial 
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the 
city's FIRM unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when 
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface 
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

Sec. 10-448. - Regulatory floodway. 
    The regulatory floodway is the designated area within Zone AE of the special flood hazard area 
established in section 10-395(b). Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity 
of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall 
apply: 
(1) ?Prohibit new private development in the regulatory floodway. Improvements to existing 
structures which do not propose an expansion of the existing footprint of such structures may be 
permitted if all other requirements of this section are fulfilled. 
(2) ?Concerning public development, prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, 
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered 
professional civil engineer, licensed by the state, is provided demonstrating through hydrologic 
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that 
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base 
flood discharge. This requirement may be satisfied by a conditional letter of map revision issued 
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(3) ?Require that the bottom of the lowest horizontal member supporting the proposed structure, 
including bridges, be elevated at least 18 inches above the base flood elevation. 
(4) ?If subsections (2) and (3) of this section are satisfied, all new construction and substantial 
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1(38-44), 11-19-2007; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1(38-44), 10-4-2010) 


Sec. 10-449. - Standards for shallow flooding areas (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the special flood hazard area established in section 10-395(b) are areas designated 
as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three 
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and 
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. In these 
areas, the following provisions apply: 
(1) ?New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured 
homes within AO/AH Zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the 
highest grade adjacent to the building, 1.5 feet or more above the depth number specified on 
the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2) ?New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO/AH 
Zones shall either: 
a. ?Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of 
the building site, 1.5 feet or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least 
two feet, if no depth number is specified); or 
b. ?Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or 
above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially 
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability 
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is 
used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as in 
section 10-446(b)(3). 
(3) ?Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and 
away from proposed structures. 
(4) ?Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO/AH Zones on the community's FIRM must 
either: 
a. ?Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b. ?Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to 
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no 
permanently attached additions; or 
c. ?Meet the requirements of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for 
manufactured homes.

pounds per square inch and shall have at least 36 inches of cover. All plastic lines shall be 
encased under or crossing improved roadway surfaces from right-of-way line to right-of-
way line. Where plastic pipe is installed longitudinally, a durable metal wire shall be 
concurrently installed or other means shall be provided for detection purposes; 
g. ?Ensure that public street crossings shall be either bored or tunneled. Pipeline installations 
across roadways may be encased or unencased. Bore holes or tunnels shall not exceed 
the diameter of the pipe by more than one inch, and shall extend from the top of the 
backslope to the top of the backslope or five feet beyond the face of the curb. Generally, 
underground line crossings should be encased in the interest of safety, protection for the 
pipeline and roadway, and for access to the pipeline. Casing shall consist of steel pipe with 
welded joints and seams and shall be designed to support the load of the roadway and 
superimposed loads thereon. All lines shall be enclosed in an adequately vented casing. 
For enclosed lines, the minimum total clear depth of cover for casing pipe shall be 30 
inches;

(c) ?Annexation and disannexation. Within 30 days following the date of the passage of any action 
effecting the annexation of any property to or the disannexation of any property from the city's 
corporate boundaries, the city agrees to furnish user written notice of the action and an accurate 
map of the city's corporate boundaries showing, if available, street names and number details. For 
the purpose of compensating the city under this chapter, a permit holder shall start including or 
excluding facilities within the affected area in the permit holder's count of facilities within 30 days of 
annexation or disannexation. 
(d) ?Telecommunications service providers uncollectibles. city and telecommunication service provider 
understand and agree that telecommunication service provider has a statutory right to pass through 
to its customers on a pro rata basis any compensation paid to the city for access to the rights-of-way. 
Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, telecommunication service provider shall not be 
obligated to pay the city for any access lines for which revenues remain uncollectible. 
(e) ?Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by 
applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers that purchase unbundled 
network elements or other facilities for the purpose of rebundling those facilities to create 
telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city shall pay to the city a rights-of-way fee 
that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate line fee, as specified in subsection (1) 
above, to each access line created by rebundling services or facilities. Such direct payment to the 
city is necessary because it is only the person creating the services for resale that will be able to 
determine the number of access lines being provided, so that the rights-of-way fee imposed herein 
can be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell 
telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the 
permit holder shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any unbundled network elements 
or other facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into 
telecommunications services, if the telecommunications service provider that is rebundling those 
facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the permit holder that the telecommunications 
service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the 
city. If permit holder provides a copy of the signed statement to the city, then permit holder is 
absolved of all responsibility for the line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities, 
and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city. 
(f) ?Fee application to leased facilities. Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Utilities Code § 54.206, a 
telecommunications service provider may collect the line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this 
chapter through a pro rata charge to the customers in the boundaries of the city, including any other 
persons who are leasing, reselling or otherwise using the permit holder's access lines to provide 
telecommunications service. With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or otherwise using a 
permit holder's access lines, if a permit holder believes it does not have sufficient information to 
determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher line fee shall apply until such time as the 
person using the access lines provides to the permit holder sufficient written information to determine 
the correct line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the line 
fee, permit holders may bill the person on the basis of the information provided. Permit holder shall 
provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities 
for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so 
long as city first obtains written permission of such other person for permit holder to provide the 
information to the city. Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, however, a 
telecommunications service provider shall not be liable for underpayment of line fees resulting from 
the permit holder's reliance upon the written information provided by any person that uses permit 
holder's service or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers.

required. Nothing contained in this chapter shall obligate the permit holder to exercise or restrict the 
permit holder from exercising its right to enter voluntarily into pole attachment, pole usage, joint 
ownership or other wire space or facilities agreements with any person authorized to operate as a 
public utility or a wireless utility or authorized to offer cable service within the city. 
(c) ?Requests for temporary moves. Upon request, the permit holder shall remove or raise or lower its

regulations is created by the reversal. 
Two or more platted lots joined together pursuant to this subsection shall be considered one 
joined lot for purposes of this chapter; provided, however, that nothing contained in this chapter,

Sec. 40-63. - General requirements. 
(a) ?Approval of plans required. Before beginning any construction of the improvements required by this 
article on proposed roadways, public utilities or drainage facilities, or structures pertaining to any 
subdivision coming under the provisions of this article and either within the city limits or its 
extraterritorial jurisdiction, complete plans and specifications for such improvements shall have first 
been approved, in their entirety, by the city engineer as meeting the appropriate standards as 
delineated in section 40-62. In addition, within 30 days following completion of all improvements as 
required by the city of the owner or subdivider of the subdivision, the owner or subdivider shall

    The public street system pattern proposed within any subdivision shall comply with design standards 
of this article and shall: 
(1) ?Provide for adequate vehicular access to all properties within the subdivision plat boundaries; 
(2) ?Provide adequate street connections to adjacent properties to ensure adequate traffic 
circulation within the general area; 
(3) ?Provide a local street system serving properties to be developed for residential purposes which 
discourages through traffic while maintaining sufficient access and traffic movement for 
convenient circulation within the subdivision and access by fire, police and other emergency 
services personnel; and 
(4) ?Provide for a sufficient number of continuous streets to accommodate the traffic demands 
generated by new development. 
(Code 1993, § 70-34; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-65. - Streets; specific standards.

(b) ?Right-of-way width, widening. The width of the right-of-way to be dedicated for any street shall be as 
follows: 
(1) ?Local streets. The width of the right-of-way for local streets shall be not less than 80 feet. 
Provided, however, a right-of-way width of not less than 60 feet may be approved if there is also 
dedicated a ten-foot-wide drainage and utility easement immediately adjacent to each side of 
such local street, which, in combination, would total 80 feet in width, and an open ditch drainage 
system is provided for such street. In those instances where a proposed subdivision is located 
adjacent to an existing public street with a right-of-way width less than 60 feet, sufficient 
additional right-of-way shall be dedicated within the subdivision to accommodate the 
development of the street to a total right-of-way width of not less than 60 feet. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the planning and zoning commission may, on written application, in its discretion 
authorize a street right-of-way width of not less than 50 feet for a local street where such street 
cannot reasonably be made to continue or extend onto an existing, approved, proposed, or 
possible future street, is so located that logically it could not be extended to connect with an 
existing, approved, or proposed street, there is not a likelihood that it would inhibit the ability of 
the city to provide emergency services from fire, police, medical, or other rescue personnel, the 
street provides access to single-family residential properties only, and the total length of such 
street does not exceed 700 feet. 
(2) ?Collector streets. The width of the right-of-way for collector streets shall be not less than 80 
feet. 
(3) ?Arterial streets. The width of the right-of-way for arterial streets shall be not less than 100 feet. 
(c) ?Abutments. All lots shown on the plat shall abut a public street, or abut a private street that shall 
meet all requirements in this section for public streets. All lots shown on the plat shall have indicated 
thereon the front of the lot for subsequent construction of a building. 
(d) ?Curves and intersections. 
(1) ?Local, collector, and arterial streets. The design and construction of all local, collector, and 
arterial streets shall meet the guidelines set forth in the Policy on Geometric Design of 
Highways and Streets, fourth edition, 2001, as published by the American Association of State 
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the city's current comprehensive plan, and 
any other applicable design and construction standards adopted by the city. Such 
considerations as adopted by the city shall include, but not be limited to street function, street 
capacity, service levels, traffic safety, pedestrian safety, and utility facilities and their location, 
which may effect the minimum requirements. Proposed streets shall meet this criteria and be 
approved by the city engineer prior to final design. 
(2) ?Right angle. The angle of street intersections shall not vary more than ten degrees from the 
perpendicular. Where acute angle intersections are approved a radius of at least 25 feet in the 
right-of-way line at the acute corner shall be provided. 
(e) ?Cul-de-sac right-of-way radii. The radii of the right-of-way at the end of local streets terminated with 
a circular cul-de-sac turnaround shall be not less than 50 feet. The city shall cause to be erected at 
the entrance of any such street a sign reading "dead-end street," but such sign shall be at the 
expense of the developer. 
(f) ?Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall not be approved except in those instances where the 
street is terminated by a temporary circular cul-de-sac turnaround or where the street is designated 
to be extended into adjacent property. Such dead-end streets must also comply with section 40-68, 
which contains the requirements for the dedication of a one-foot reserve. 
(g) ?Signs and traffic control devices. The developer shall be responsible for the installation of all 
required street signs and traffic control devices, as determined by the city engineer or his designee. 
All such signs and traffic control devices shall be in accordance with the most recent edition of the 
Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, as published by the state department of 
transportation. 
(h) ?Street lighting. The developer shall be responsible for the installation of street lighting in accordance 
with the City of Tomball Minimum Construction Standards for Community Improvements. 
(i) ?Sidewalks. The developer shall be responsible for the installation of sidewalks in all residential and 
commercial subdivisions, except in residential subdivisions along streets with open ditch drainage. At 
the discretion of the city manager or designee, a developer of a subdivision may be permitted to pay 
a fee in lieu of the construction of sidewalks in an amount set forth in the city master fee schedule 
adopted by the city council. Any person wishing to appeal the determination of the city manager or 
designee may do so by submitting an appeal to the city council within ten days of the city manager or 
designee's determination. Such will be heard at the next available city council meeting. Sidewalks 
shall be constructed in accordance with the City of Tomball Minimum Construction Standards for 
Community Improvements. Sidewalks, when applicable, shall be considered as part of the required 
street system, whether public or private.

Sec. 40-67. - Street names. 
    All streets dedicated by plat shall be named, and so identified on such plat, in conformance with the 
following: 
(1) ?New streets. New street names shall not duplicate existing street names located within the city, 
other than extensions of existing streets. 
(2) ?Extensions of existing streets. Existing street names shall be used in those instances where a 
new street is a direct extension of an existing street or a logical extension (when the streets in 
question are not and cannot be physically continuous) thereof except in those instances where 
the existing street name is a duplicate street name. 
(3) ?Suffixes. Street name suffixes such as court, circle and loop should be designated on streets 
that are cul-de-sac or in a configuration of a loop street. 
(4) ?Prefixes. Street name prefixes such as north, south, east and west may be used to clarify the 
general location of the street; however, such prefixes shall be consistent with the existing and 
established street naming and address numbering system of the general area in which the 
street is located. 
(5) ?Alphabetical and numerical streets prohibited. Alphabetical and numerical street names shall 
not be designated, except in those instances where such street is a direct extension of an 
existing street with such a name and is not a duplicate street name.

Sec. 40-68. - One-foot reserves. 
    In those instances where a street is established by a plat submitted to the planning and zoning 
commission and such street forms a stub street onto adjacent unplatted acreage, or where such street 
lies along and parallel with the subdivision boundary and is adjacent to unplatted acreage, a one-foot-
wide reserve shall be established within the street right-of-way at its dead-end terminus, or along the 
right-of-way adjacent to such unplatted acreage, to form a buffer strip, dedicated to the public, between 
the street right-of-way and the adjacent unplatted acreage, to prevent access to such street from the 
adjacent unsubdivided acreage, unless and until the planning and zoning commission has reviewed the 
development proposals for such adjacent acreage, and a plat of the adjacent property is duly recorded. 
The conditions associated with the establishment of a one-foot reserve on a plat are contained in the 
following notation that shall be placed upon the face of any plat where a one-foot reserve is to be 
established: 
    "One-foot reserve dedicated to the city in fee as a buffer separation between the side or end of 
streets where such streets abut adjacent acreage tracts, the condition of such dedication being that 
when the adjacent property is subdivided pursuant to a recorded plat, the one-foot reserve shall 
thereupon become vested in the public for street right-of-way purposes." 
(Code 1993, § 70-38; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-69. - Partial or half streets. 
    Partial or half streets may be dedicated in those instances where the planning and zoning 
commission determines that it is necessary for the proper development of the land and in the public 
interest to locate a public street right-of-way centered on a property line. The planning and zoning 
commission shall not approve a partial or half street dedication within a subdivision dedicating less than a 
50-foot right-of-way width for a designated arterial street, or less than a 40-foot right-of-way width for a 
designated collector street, or less than a 30-foot right-of-way width for any other type public street. 
Appropriate notations and the one-foot reserve dedication in fee as provided in section 40-68 shall be 
placed upon the plat restricting access from any partial or half streets so dedicated to adjacent acreage 
tracts until the adjacent property is subdivided pursuant to a recorded plat and the additional adjacent 
right-of-way is acquired providing the full right-of-way as specified in this article. 
(Code 1993, § 70-39; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-70. - Easements. 
(a) ?Utility easements. Utility easements, both above and below grade, are those easements established 
by plat or separate instrument which are dedicated to the city for public use and designed to 
accommodate facilities necessary to provide various types of utility services to the individual 
properties within the plat boundaries. Utility easements may be used for, but not be limited to, 
facilities necessary to provide water, electrical power, natural gas, telephone, telegraph, cable 
television, and sanitary sewer services. 
(1) ?Location. Utility easements shall be provided along the front of all lots except when the 
planning and zoning commission determines that such location is not feasible for the orderly 
development of the subdivision, or where the right-of-way is not wide enough to allow for the 
proper placement and maintenance of all utilities. Utility easements located along the outer 
boundaries of a subdivision shall contain the full width required for such easement except in 
those instances where the adjacent property is within a portion of a previously approved and 
platted subdivision and under the same ownership as the property being platted or where 
additional easement width is dedicated by separate instrument by the owner of said adjacent 
tract. In such cases, one-half of the required easement width shall be dedicated within the 
platted boundary with the other one-half provided outside the platted boundary by separate 
instrument or through notation on the plat certifying the ownership and dedication of said 
easement. 
(2) ?Widths. All utility easements established within any subdivision plat shall not be less than ten 
feet in width, but may be required to be greater where determined by the city engineer. 
(3) ?Limitations. All utility easements shall be limited to surface and below-grade easements. Aerial 
easements over utility easements shall be limited to that necessary for transformers, amplifiers, 
and other similar devices that cannot be placed below grade, it being the express purpose and 
intent hereof to require all utilities, to the extent reasonably possible, to be placed below ground 
level. 
(b) ?Drainage easements. All drainage easements shall be located and properly dedicated to the city to 
accommodate the drainage requirements necessary for the proper development of the property 
within the subdivision boundaries and within its natural watershed and in conformance with the city's 
comprehensive plan, its regulations governing storm drainage and/or flood control, and the 
requirements of other governmental agencies having jurisdiction over storm drainage or flood control 
within the area in which the subdivision is located. A suitable note on the plat shall restrict all 
properties within the subdivision to ensure that drainage easements within the plat boundaries shall 
be kept clear of fences, buildings, obstructive vegetation, and other obstructions to the operation and 
maintenance of the drainage facilities therein. 
(c) ?Stormwater detention easements. Each stormwater detention easement shall be located and 
designed in accordance with applicable standards of governmental agencies having jurisdiction over 
surface water drainage or flood control within the area in which the proposed subdivision or 
development is located. Each subdivision plat that dedicates a stormwater detention easement shall 
contain a restriction on the plat that: 
(1) ?Prohibits the construction of fences or buildings, whether temporary or permanent, or 
installation or maintenance of plantings or other obstructions to the operation and maintenance 
of the facility, within the stormwater detention easement or upon properties adjacent thereto; 
and 
(2) ?Prohibits drainage from abutting properties directly into the stormwater detention easement 
except by means of a drainage structure approved by the city engineer or the authorized public 
drainage or flood control official. 
(d) ?Private easements, fee strips. 
(1) ?Existing easements, fee strips. All easements or fee strips created prior to the subdivision of 
any tract of land shall be shown on the subdivision plat of said land with appropriate notations 
indicating the name of the holder of such easement or fee strip, the purpose of the easement 
and generally the facilities contained therein, the dimensions of the easement or fee strip tied to 
all adjacent lot lines, street rights-of-way and plat boundary lines, and the recording reference of 
the instruments creating and establishing said easement or fee strip. In those instances where 
easements have not been defined by accurate survey dimensions such as over and across type 
easements, the subdivider shall request the holder of such easement to accurately define the 
limits and location of such easement through the property within the plat boundaries. If the 
holder of such undefined easement does not define the easement involved and will not certify 
his refusal to define such easement to the planning and zoning commission, the subdivision plat 
shall provide accurate information as to the centerline location of all existing pipelines or other 
utility facilities placed in conformance with the easement holder's rights, and building setback 
lines shall be established not less than 15 feet from and parallel to both sides of the centerline 
of all underground pipelines or pole lines involved. 
(2) ?Establishment of special use utility or drainage easements. A special use utility or drainage 
easement may be established by subdivision plat when such easement is for the purpose of 
accommodating a utility or drainage facility owned, operated, and maintained by a unit of 
government and is restricted to either water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, or other 
drainage purposes and where it has been determined by the planning and zoning commission 
that these facilities cannot or should not be accommodated within a general purpose public 
utility or drainage easement or public street right-of-way. Easements proposed to be established 
for any privately-owned utility company or private organization providing utility services and 
restricted for their exclusive use shall not be created by a subdivision plat; however, such 
private utility facilities may be accommodated and placed within the general purpose utility 
easements and public streets established within the plat boundary. Nothing in this section, 
however, may prevent such private companies or the subdivider from granting and establishing 
special or exclusive use easements by separate instrument if such arrangements are deemed 
necessary to properly serve the properties within the plat boundaries. 
(Code 1993, § 70-40; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-71. - Federal flood insurance program. 
    No subdivision of land shall be approved unless the same complies in all respects with the city's 
flood damage prevention regulations, as found in chapter 10, article VIII. Each final plat shall have 
depicted thereon applicable boundaries of all flood zones as provided in the latest edition of the federal 
insurance rate maps. 
(Code 1993, § 70-41; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-72. - Building setback requirements. 
    No plat of any subdivision shall be approved unless building setback lines are established therein in 
accordance with the city's applicable regulations, as found in chapters 10 and 50. 
(Code 1993, § 70-42; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 
State Law reference Building lines, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 214.131 et seq. 


Sec. 40-73. - Reserve tracts. 
    Reserve tracts are those individual parcels of land created within a platted subdivision which are not 
divided into residential or commercial lots, but are established to accommodate some specific purpose 
such as a private recreational facility, school or church site, or site for utility facilities or other activities or 
land uses for which division into lots is not appropriate. Since the use of reserve tracts may not be 
completely determined by the subdivider or developer at the time plats are prepared and submitted to the 
city, these reserve tracts are often established as unrestricted reserves that allows maximum flexibility in 
the determination of the ultimate use planned for such properties. 
(1) ?Street access. Reserves established on any subdivision plat shall have frontage on and be 
immediately adjacent to at least one street, with such frontage being not less than 60 feet in 
width. 
(2) ?Identification and designation. All reserves shall be labeled and identified on the plat, and a 
description of the use intended for such reserve, if known, shall be noted. If the use of the 
reserve is not restricted for any specific use, the reserve shall be identified and noted as being 
"unrestricted." All reserves are to be identified and designated by alphabetical letters, not 
numbers, along with an indication as to the total acreage of such reserves that shall be shown 
within each reserve boundary. 
(3) ?Special purpose reserves. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this article or in 
chapters 10 and 50, special purpose reserves may be created which do not otherwise comply 
with minimum lot size requirements. The term "special purpose reserves" shall mean tracts 
restricted to a use beneficial to the public or to the owners of lots within a subdivision, including 
but not limited to, tracts housing facilities for utilities, common area amenities such as parks, 
playgrounds and greenbelts, pipeline regulator stations, and community signs, The planning 
and zoning commission shall be authorized to waive requirements contained in this article which 
are, because of the nature of the restricted reserve's use, deemed by the planning and zoning 
commission as inapplicable or inappropriate. For example, the planning and zoning commission 
would be authorized to waive the requirement that sanitary sewer service be available to a 
special purpose reserve that is restricted to the housing of a subdivision identification sign. Any 
special purpose reserve shall be identified on the plat as such, and shall contain an appropriate 
notation of the restrictions applicable thereto. 
(Code 1993, § 70-43; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-74. - Lots, general provisions. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide general overall guidelines for the establishment of individual 
lots within a subdivision. 
(1) ?General lot design, arrangement, layout. The general lot design within any subdivision shall be 
based upon the concept that such lots are created and established as undivided tracts of land 
and that purchasers of such lots can be assured that these tracts of land meet the applicable 
regulations, including those found in chapters 10 and 50, which are based upon the following 
basic criteria: 
a. ?That the lot is of sufficient size and shape to accommodate easements for all public and 
private utility services and facilities to adequately serve any residential dwelling unit 
constructed thereon. 
b. ?That the lot is of sufficient size and shape and is so located that direct vehicular access is 
provided from a public street or through an approved private street and that the required 
number of off-street parking spaces can be provided on the lot without encroachment 
within any adjacent public or private street right-of-way. 
(2) ?Lot shapes. Lots shall be designed, so far as possible, with side lot lines being at right angles 
or radial to any adjacent street right-of-way line. Where all lots are either perpendicular and at 
right angles or radial to adjacent street rights-of-way, a suitable notation shall be placed upon 
the plat in lieu of lot line bearings. 
(3) ?Key or flag shaped lots. For the purposes of this section, a key or flag shaped lot shall mean a 
lot having gross disparities in width between side lot lines, sometimes resembling a flag on a 
flag pole, a key, or some other lot shape of comparable irregularity. Key or flag shaped lots shall 
not be prohibited if otherwise in compliance with the minimum lot size requirements of this 
chapter and other applicable regulations of the city and provided that no portion of any such lot 
is less than 50 feet in width. 
(4) ?Street access limitations. Rear and side vehicular driveway access from lots to adjacent streets 
designated as major thoroughfares or any other public street which carries a traffic volume 
where additional vehicular driveways would create a traffic hazard or impede the flow of traffic, 
shall not be approved and such access restriction shall be noted directly upon the plat and 
adjacent to the lots in question. 
(5) ?Lot and block identification. All blocks established in a subdivision shall be designated on the 
plat, and shall be numbered consecutively throughout the entire subdivision. Lots established 
within blocks shall also be numbered consecutively within the block. Lot numbering shall be 
cumulative throughout the subdivision if the numbering system continues from block to block in 
a uniform manner. 
(Code 1993, § 70-44; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-75. - Minimum lot sizes. 
    Lot sizes shall comply with minimum requirements set forth in the applicable ordinances of the city, 
including chapter 50. 
(Code 1993, § 70-45; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-76. - Utilities. 
    Adequate provision for all utilities shall be provided to the entire subdivision. All distribution and 
service lines of, telephone, television, and other wire-carrier type (other than electric) utilities shall be 
underground. Transformers, amplifiers, or similar devices associated with the underground lines (other 
than electric) shall be located upon the ground or below ground level. Where the underground placement 
of such facilities, other than electric facilities, is not a standard practice of the utility involved, the 
subdivider or developer shall request the applicable utility to place the facilities underground and shall pay 
all costs associated with the non-standard installation. Electric utility distribution lines shall be 
underground if the customer elects such non-standard installation pursuant to the terms of the utility's 
distribution tariff. Electric distribution lines, if installed above ground, shall be located along the perimeter 
of the overall subdivision unless the utility determines different placement is needed to provide safe and 
reliable electric service. All utility installations, other than electric, shall comply with the "City of Tomball 
Minimum Construction Standards for Community Improvements." 
(Code 1993, § 70-46; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002; Ord. No. 2014-04, § 2(70-46), 2-3-2014; 
Ord. No. 2014-36 , § 2, 11-3-2014) 


Sec. 40-77. - Drainage. 
    Drainage facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with all federal, state, and local 
rules and regulations, including the City of Tomball Minimum Construction Standards for Community 
Improvements. 
(Code 1993, § 70-47; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-78. - Sanitary sewer. 
    Sanitary sewer facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with all federal, state, and 
local rules and regulations, including the City of Tomball Minimum Construction Standards for Community 
Improvements. Each lot within a proposed subdivision shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system of 
the city if any point within such subdivision is located within 1,000 feet of the city's collection system 
therefor. No septic tank system shall be permitted within any newly platted subdivision when connection 
to the city's sanitary sewer system is required under this section. 
(Code 1993, § 70-48; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-79. - Water. 
    Facilities for the provision of potable water to all areas of the proposed subdivision shall be designed 
and constructed in accordance with the "City of Tomball Minimum Construction Standards for Community 
Improvements." Each lot within a proposed subdivision shall be connected to the potable water 
distribution system of the city if any point within such subdivision is located within 1,000 feet of the city's 
distribution system therefor. No water well shall be permitted within any newly platted subdivision if 
potable water is available from the city's system as provided in this section. 
(Code 1993, § 70-49; Ord. No. 2001-19, § 2, 1-7-2002) 


Sec. 40-80. - Monuments and markers. 
(a) ?Concrete monuments, six inches in diameter and 24 inches long, shall be placed on all boundary 
corners, block corners, curve points, and angle points. A copper pin one-quarter inch in diameter 
embedded three inches in the monument shall be placed at the exact intersection point on the 
monument. The monuments shall be set at such an elevation that they will not be disturbed during 
construction, and the top of the monument shall not be less than 12 inches below the finish ground 
level. 
(b) ?Lot markers shall be five-eighths inch or greater reinforcing bar, 24 inches long, or approved equal, 
and shall be placed at all lot corners flush with the ground, or below ground if necessary in order to 
avoid being disturbed. 
(c) ?Where no benchmark is established or can be found within 300 feet of the boundary of the 
subdivision, such benchmark shall be established to the latest edition of the U.S. Coast and 
Geodetic Survey datum. The benchmark shall be established upon a permanent structure, or may be 
set as a monument and shall be readily accessible and identifiable on the ground.

encumbrances, such as various types of easements both public and private, fee strips, and all 
significant topographical features which would affect the physical development of the property 
illustrated on this plat are accurately identified and located and further certify that this plat

units equivalent as determined by the size of the water meters for the development, or, 
alternatively, based on the recommendation of the director as a result of an engineering report 
prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering 
services in the state, which demonstrates that the number of LUEs of service for the new 
development will be more than those indicated by the size of the water meter. 
(3) ?If the director determines that the water pressure in the city's transmission main is significantly 
higher or lower than standard pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of 
actual service demand, the director may adjust the number of LUEs based on a smaller or 
larger sized meter that more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure 
conditions. 
(4) ?If a fire demand meter (tap) is purchased for a property, the meter size utilized to calculate the 
number of LUEs shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter that reflects the 
meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property. Such reduced meter size 
shall then be utilized to calculate the number of LUEs. 
a. ?The meter types used to calculate the number of LUEs shall be either simple or compound 
meters. 
b. ?To avoid the use of fire flow volumes for domestic usage, the owner of any property for 
which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant 
on a form approved by the city attorney, which covenant shall acknowledge the right of the 
city to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property. Such covenant shall be 
executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed 
records of the county.

    The maximum capital recovery fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed by 
dividing the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the service area identified in the capital 
improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, by the total number of projected service 
units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, 
based on the land use assumptions for that service area, and subtracting credits in the form of future rate 
or tax contributions to CIP funding.

(Ord. No. 2015-20 , § 2, 10-19-2015) 


Sec. 48-212. - Tow truck rotation lists to be established; contents; qualifications; use. 
(a) ?Qualifications. The city police department shall establish and maintain a tow truck rotation list. Each 
tow truck company is required to complete any and all applications and provide required information 
necessary to apply for the tow truck rotation list. 
    To be eligible for the rotation list, each tow truck company is required to comply with all of the 
following requirements: 
(1) ?Maintain a 24-hour tow service; have one telephone number which is answered 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week; and uses a VSF that meets or exceeds the Texas Accessibility 
Standards ("TAS") accessibility criteria, approved by the United States Department of Justice; 
and 
(2) ?Certify in writing that the VSF meets or exceeds the criteria set forth by Texas Accessibility 
Standards, a copy of which will be provided by the city at the time the tow company applies for 
inclusion on the tow rotation list. 
Only those tow trucks that are included on the tow company's tow truck license and are permitted by 
the city are authorized to respond to incident management rotation calls. A tow company may not 
substitute a tow truck from a different tow company to respond to an incident management call. 
(b) ?The tow truck rotation list shall contain the names, in alphabetical order, of all qualified license 
holders requesting to be on such list. 
(c) ?A license holder is qualified to be on such list if: 
(1) ?He meets the requirements of section 48-177; 
(2) ?He maintains 24-hour tow truck service and has no more than one telephone number, which is 
answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The use of a telephone answering service shall 
be permitted, provided that if such service is used, the failure of a license holder to 
communicate with the police communications center or its authorized agent within five minutes 
following a call requesting a dispatch of a certified tow truck, confirming that the license holder 
shall immediately dispatch a certified tow truck to the desired location, will result in a forfeiture 
by that license holder of that call; and 
(3) ?His tow trucks are equipped with communications equipment compatible with the radio 
communications equipment used to dispatch tow trucks on the tow truck rotation list. 
(d) ?When the police officer investigating a collision determines that any vehicle involved in a collision is 
unable to safely proceed under its own power or, when the police officer determines that the driver of 
any vehicle involved in a collision is physically unable to safely move the vehicle to a location where 
it will not create a traffic hazard, such officer shall request the driver to designate the tow truck 
license holder which he desires to remove the vehicle. 
(1) ?When the designation has been properly made, the police officer shall communicate the name 
of the designated license holder to the police communications center or its authorized agent. 
(2) ?The police communications center or its authorized agent shall cause the designated license 
holder to be called and directed to send to the scene of the collision a permitted tow truck. 
(3) ?Any police officer investigating an accident or offense within the city may order the non-consent 
tow to impound of any vehicle involved therein when, in the judgment of such officer, criminal 
prosecution will be involved as a result of such event, or when it is necessary to impound such 
vehicle to secure evidence, or when the owner or occupant of the vehicle is unable or fails to 
have such vehicle removed, or when the vehicle is stopped for a traffic violation, to effect an 
arrest, or is involved in an accident on a public roadway or public property and the vehicle's 
owner or operator fails to show proof of financial responsibility as required under V.T.C.A., 
Transportation Code ch. 601 as amended. The fees to be charged for impound tows will not 
exceed the maximum rates allowed under this article or state law. 
(e) ?If the owner of a vehicle involved in a collision is physically unable to designate the permit holder he 
desires to remove the vehicle, the police officer shall deem this vehicle a non-owner consent tow and 
the police officer shall communicate that fact immediately to the police communications center or its 
authorized agent. The police communications center or its authorized agent shall then call the 
license holder next in line on the tow truck rotation list and request the license holder to tow the 
vehicle from the scene of the collision to a storage lot as specified in section 48-139. After the last 
license holder on such list has been called, the next such call shall go to the first license holder on 
the list. If two or more license holders are called to the scene of a collision, with no designation from 
vehicle operators, the vehicles to be towed may be selected by the permit holders in order of the tow 
truck rotation list, unless the police officer in charge requests that vehicles be removed prior to arrival 
of the selected license holder. 
(f) ?If the license holder after arrival at the scene determines, in conjunction with the police officer in 
charge, that assistance is needed, then the police officer shall communicate that fact immediately to 
the police communications center, or its authorized agent, which shall proceed under subsection (e) 
of this section. 
(g) ?Forfeiture of calls. Failure of any tow truck to check in route, by radio or phone, to the designated 
location within ten minutes of dispatch making contact with the listed phone number of the tow 
company or arriving at the designated location dispatched by the city within 25 minutes of being 
called will result in the forfeiture of that call and shall be considered a violation of this article. Three 
such forfeitures within 12 months may result in temporary removal from the rotation list. Repeat 
offenses may result in permanent removal for the annual cycle. 
(h) ?If a license holder or his driver is towing a vehicle and receives a tow truck rotation call, the license 
holder or his driver must complete the original tow before accepting the rotation list call. If the license 
holder or his driver is unable to complete the original tow within the required response time as 
referenced in subsection (g) of this section, he must forfeit the call. 
(i) ?Unneeded calls. If a tow company is called to respond to a scene by a police officer and 
subsequently is not needed, that tow company will be placed as "next in line" on the tow rotation list. 
If a tow truck responds and performs minor service that enables the vehicle to be driven, and for 
which no fee is charged, that tow company will be placed as "next in line" on the tow rotation list. 
(j) ?Temporary removal from list. Should a tow company wish to be removed from the tow rotation list for 
a specific period of time, the tow company shall notify the police department dispatch, in writing, fax 
or e-mail, if the time off requested is 24 hours or longer. It shall be the tow company's responsibility 
to notify dispatch in writing, fax, or e-mail, when the tow company wishes to return to the tow rotation 
list. 
(k) ?Method of receiving payment. Each qualified tow company must be able to accept cash or 
credit/debit card payments for services rendered. 
(l) ?Maximum number of licenses issued and placed on city rotation list. The 11 permitted towing 
companies holding a vehicle tow service rotation license as of September 30, 2014, may apply for 
renewal so long as they remain qualified under the terms of this chapter. The city will issue no other 
vehicle tow service licenses until and unless the number of licensed towing companies on the city 
non-consent towing rotation list is eight or less because of attrition. If at any time there are six or 
fewer licensed towing companies on the city's non-consent towing list, the city will consider 
applications from other qualified companies. Those applications will be considered in the order in 
which they were filed, and the city secretary shall issue a license to any qualified towing company 
based on their application, until such time as there are sufficient qualified licensed tow truck 
companies on the city's vehicle tow service rotation list. The maximum number of companies, 
licensed, and on the city's rotation list will be henceforth determined by the chief of police or his 
designee based on service needs.

prohibited. 
(a) ?All wrecker drivers, owners, or agencies are prohibited from soliciting the business of towing,

by words, cards, circulars, or gestures. A violation of this section shall be a class C misdemeanor 
and upon conviction shall be punishable as provided in section 1-14. 
(b) ?Driving tow trucks to scene of an incident prohibited. No tow company shall drive, or cause to be 
driven, a tow truck to or near the scene of an incident on a street within the city unless such tow

city when properly called upon to do so in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(b) ?The duty to provide safe and prompt tow truck service upon call includes, but is not limited to, the 
following specific duties: 
(1) ?Taking direction from investigating officer. Upon arrival at the scene of a collision within the 
city, tow truck operators shall take directions on when to engage or tow from the police officer 
investigating the collision; 
(2) ?Removing debris of collision. Tow truck operators that engage and tow any vehicle from the 
scene of a collision within the city shall remove all debris of the collision from the public street. 
This duty specifically includes the removal of vehicle parts, glass, and other debris. Such debris 
shall be disposed of in a lawful manner, which will keep it out of the gutters, storm sewers, 
streams, public rights-of-way, or property not belonging to the tow company; 
(3) ?Disengaging. A tow truck that removes a vehicle from the original location shall not disengage 
from the vehicle until the vehicle has been deposited with the appropriate VSF except when the 
vehicle is released to the owner or operator or when the owner or operator specifies the location 
of disengagement. This restriction is enacted to prohibit tow trucks from engaging an 
unauthorized vehicle in a parking facility and moving it to a close location, then returning for 
another unauthorized vehicle, ultimately towing all the relocated vehicles to a VSF; 
(4) ?Any license holder on the tow truck rotation list must tow or have towed the damaged vehicle to 
a repair shop or to a place designated by the owner, unless the owner of the vehicle is disabled 
by physical injury and is, therefore, unable to designate a location for the vehicle to be towed. 
The license holder shall then store the vehicle in a state-licensed depository located in the city 
until released to the vehicle owner or agent. The selling of such right to tow any disabled vehicle 
is prohibited. The tow truck operator shall sign the Form 319 provided by the police department 
prior to leaving the scene and shall accept the responsibility of removing the vehicle until 
relieved of this responsibility. A violation of this section shall subject a license holder to a class 
C misdemeanor and fine as set forth in this article; and 
(5) ?Drops. A tow truck that has hooked up to a vehicle for towing shall release the vehicle to its 
owner or operator upon receiving a drop fee payment and will not tow the vehicle, except when 
the vehicle is being taken into custody by a police officer. A vehicle is hooked up if it is 
immediately ready for transport. A vehicle is not hooked up unless it can be legally towed on a 
public roadway.

it in such a manner as not to interfere with traffic.

has occurred or attach his tow truck to the wrecked or disabled vehicle until the driver of the vehicle 
has given permission or until the city police officer investigating the accident has completed his 
investigation. 
(b) ?The fact that no police officer of the city is present at the scene of an accident when a tow truck 
which has been summoned to the scene by the vehicle owner arrives shall not constitute an 
exception to this section. It shall be the duty of any tow truck owner or driver desiring to tow or haul 
any wrecked or disabled vehicle from the accident scene to notify the police department of the 
accident and to wait for the police officer to arrive and complete his investigation. 
(c) ?If the driver of a wrecked or disabled vehicle has been rendered unable by the accident to give 
permission to an tow truck driver to remove the wrecked or disabled vehicle, the investigating police 
officer shall notify the chief of police or other officer in charge of accident investigation of such fact,

vehicle from the street. In any event, with or without the driver's permission, the investigating police 
officers are empowered to order any wrecked or disabled vehicle to be moved a distance sufficient to 
clear the street for traffic or taken to a state-approved storage lot within the city.

determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter; 
b. ?Authorize, in specific cases, a variance or special exception (see section 50-33, 
subsections (f) and (g) of this section) from the terms of this chapter if the variance is not 
contrary to the public interest and if, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the 
chapter would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter is 
observed and substantial justice is done; and 
c. ?Make interpretations on zoning district boundaries shown on the zoning map where 
uncertainty exists because physical features on the ground differ from those on the zoning 
map or where the rules in section 50-64 do not apply or are ambiguous. 
(2) ?In exercising its authority under subsection (d)(1)a of this section, the board of adjustments 
may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order, 
requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct 
order, requirement, decision or determination, and for that purpose the board has the same 
authority as the city manager or his designee. 
(3) ?The concurring vote of at least four members of the board of adjustments is necessary to: 
a. ?Reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of an administrative official; 
b. ?Decide in favor of an applicant on a matter on which the board is required to review under 
this chapter; 
c. ?Authorize a variance from a provision of this chapter; or 
d. ?Hear and decide special exceptions to a provision of this chapter (see section 50-33 
subsection (g) of this section). 
(e) ?Limitations on authority. 
(1) ?The board of adjustments may not grant a variance authorizing a use other than those 
permitted in the district for which the variance is sought, except as specifically provided for in 
this chapter. 
(2) ?The board of adjustments shall have no power to grant or modify conditional use provisions 
authorized under section 50-81. 
(3) ?The board of adjustments shall have no power to grant a zoning amendment. In the event that 
a request for a zoning amendment is pending before the planning and zoning commission or the 
city council, the board shall neither hear nor grant any variances with respect to the subject 
property until final disposition of the zoning amendment by the commission and the city council. 
(4) ?The board of adjustments shall not grant a variance for any parcel of property or portion thereof 
upon which a required site plan (refer to section 50-36), or any plat is pending on the agenda of 
the planning and zoning commission and/or the city council. All administrative and procedural 
remedies available to the applicant shall have been exhausted prior to hearing by the board of 
adjustments. 
(f) ?Variances. 
(1) ?Defined. A variance is the authority to depart from the application of areas, side yard, setback, 
height, and similar regulations to prevent unnecessary hardships. 
(2) ?Granting authority. The board of adjustments may authorize a variance from these regulations 
when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring compliance. Variances may be 
granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter so that the 
public health, safety and welfare may be secured and that substantial justice may be done. 
a. ?In granting a variance, the board shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary 
for, or desirable to, the public interest. 
b. ?In making the findings outlined in subsection (f)(3) of this section, the board shall take into 
account: 
1. ?The nature of the proposed use of the land involved; 
2. ?Existing uses of land in the vicinity; 
3. ?The number of persons who will reside or work within the proposed use; and 
4. ?The probable effect such variance will have upon traffic conditions and upon the public 
health, safety, convenience and welfare of the community. 
(3) ?Conditions required. No variance shall be granted without first having given public notice and 
having held a public hearing on the variance request in accordance with section 50-33 
subsection (c) of this section and unless the board of adjustments finds: 
a. ?That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the 
application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable 
use of his land; 
b. ?That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property 
right of the applicant; 
c. ?That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or 
welfare, or injurious to other property within the area; 
d. ?That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly use of 
other land within the area in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; and 
e. ?The granting of an individual variance will not set a precedent. 
Such findings of the board of adjustments, together with the specific facts upon which such 
findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the board of adjustments 
meeting at which such variance is granted. 
(4) ?Findings of undue hardship. In order to grant a variance, the board of adjustments must make 
findings that an undue hardship exists, using the following criteria: 
a. ?That literal enforcement of the controls will create an unnecessary hardship or practical 
difficulty in the development of the affected property; 
b. ?That the situation causing the hardship or difficulty is neither self-imposed nor generally 
affecting all or most properties in the same zoning district; 
c. ?That the relief sought will not injure the permitted use of adjacent conforming property; 
d. ?That the granting of a variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of this 
chapter; and 
e. ?Financial hardship alone is not an undue hardship if the property can be used, meeting the 
requirements of the zoning district it is located in. 
(5) ?Self-inflicted hardship. A variance shall not: 
a. ?Be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship; 
b. ?Be based solely upon economic gain or loss; 
c. ?Permit or allow any person a privilege or advantage in developing a parcel of land not 
permitted or allowed by this chapter to other parcels of land in the same particular zoning 
district; 
d. ?Result in undue hardship upon another parcel of land. 
(g) ?Special exceptions. 
(1) ?Defined. A special exception is a type of variance, but is differentiated from a variance by the 
following: 
a. ?A special exception does not require a finding of a hardship. 
b. ?Approval of a special exception by the board of adjustments is specifically provided for and 
defined in this chapter. 
c. ?A special exception applies to nonconforming uses and structures, off-street parking 
requirements, Façade Overlay District requirements, and landscaping requirements. 
(2) ?Requests. The board of adjustments may grant a special exception to the provisions of 
sections 50-31, 50-112 and/or 50-113 upon written request of the property owner. 
(3) ?Standards. The board may also grant a special exception in accordance with the following 
circumstances and/or standards: 
a. ?Change from one nonconforming use to another, reconstruction of a nonconforming 
structure that has been totally destroyed, or resumption of a nonconforming use previously 
abandoned, only upon finding that the failure to grant the special exception deprives the 
property owner of substantially all use or economic value of the land. 
b. ?For existing single-family and duplex (two-family) structures that were legally constructed 
prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the board of 
adjustments may authorize a special exception for any structure that was constructed over 
a setback line established by this chapter. 
(4) ?Conditions. In granting special exceptions under this subsection (g) of this section, the board 
may impose such conditions as are necessary to protect adjacent property owners and to 
ensure the public health, safety and general welfare, including but not limited to conditions 
specifying the period during which the nonconforming use may continue to operate or exist 
before being brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(h) ?Appeals. 
(1) ?Authority. In addition to the authorization of variances and special exceptions from the terms of 
this chapter, the board of adjustments shall have the authority to hear and decide an appeal that 
alleges error in an order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative 
official in the enforcement of this chapter. The board of adjustments may reverse or affirm, in 
whole or in part, or may modify the administrative official's order, requirement, decision or 
determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision 
or determination, and for that purpose, the board of adjustments has the same authority as the 
city manager or his designee. 
(2) ?Who may appeal. Any of the following persons may appeal to the board of adjustments a 
decision made by an administrative official: 
a. ?A person directly aggrieved by the decision; or 
b. ?Any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by the decision. 
(3) ?Procedure for appeal. The appellant must file with the board of adjustments and the official 
from whom the appeal is taken a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal. 
The notice of appeal shall be filed within 15 calendar days after the decision has been rendered. 
Upon receiving the notice, the official from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit 
to the board of adjustments all papers constituting the record of action that is appealed. An 
appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from 
whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the board of adjustments facts supporting the 
official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the 
proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the board of adjustments or a 
court of appropriate jurisdiction on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown. 
The appellant party may appear at the appeal hearing in person or by agent or attorney. The 
board shall decide the appeal within 30 calendar days after the written request (i.e., notice of 
appeal) was received. The board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the 
administrative official's order, requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is 
taken, and may make the correct order, requirement, decision or determination. 
(i) ?Procedures. 
(1) ?Application and fee. An application for a variance, special exception or appeal to the board of 
adjustments shall be made in writing using forms prescribed by the city, and shall be 
accompanied by an application fee in accordance with the city council's adopted fee schedule, a 
required plan (see section 50-36), and any other additional information as may be requested in 
order to properly review the application. There is no filing fee for an appeal filed by any officer, 
department, board, or bureau of the city affected by the decision. 
(2) ?Review and report by the city. The city manager, or his designee, shall visit the site where the 
proposed variance or special exception will apply and the surrounding area, and shall report his 
findings to the board of adjustments. 
(3) ?Notice and public hearing. The board of adjustments shall hold a public hearing for 
consideration of the variance or special exception request no later than 60 calendar days after 
the date the application for action, or an appeal, is filed. Notice shall be published in the official 
local newspaper before the 15th calendar day prior to the public hearing. Written notice of the 
public hearing for a variance or exception shall also be sent to all owners of property, as 
indicated by the most recently approved city tax roll, that is located within the area of application 
and within 200 feet of any property affected thereby, said written notice to be sent before the 
tenth calendar day prior to the date such hearing is held. Such notice shall be served by using 
the last known address as listed on the most recently approved tax roll and depositing the 
notice, postage paid, in the regular United States mail. 
(4) ?Action by the board of adjustments. The board of adjustments shall not grant a variance unless 
it finds, based upon compelling evidence provided by the applicant, that each of the conditions 
in subsection (f) of this section have been satisfied. The board of adjustments may impose such 
conditions, limitations and safeguards as it deems appropriate upon the granting of any 
variance or special exception as are necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience 
and welfare. Violation of any such condition, limitation or safeguard shall constitute a violation of 
this chapter. 
(5) ?Burden of proof. The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing the facts that may 
justify a variance, a special exception, an appeal, or any other action in his favor by the board. 
(6) ?Waiting period. No appeal to the board for the same or a related variance or special exception 
on the same piece of property shall be allowed for a waiting period of 180-calendar-days 
following an unfavorable ruling by the board unless other property in the immediate vicinity has, 
within the 180 calendar day waiting period, been changed or acted upon by the board or the city 
council so as to alter the facts and conditions upon which the previous unfavorable board action 
was based. Such changes of circumstances shall permit the re-hearing of a variance or special 
exception request by the board, but such circumstances shall in no way have any force in law to 
compel the board, after a hearing on the matter, to grant a subsequent variance or special 
exception request. Any subsequent variance or special exception request shall be considered 
entirely on its own merits and on the specific circumstances related to the subject property. 
(7) ?Timeliness of application for building permit or certificate of occupancy. Upon a favorable board 
action on a variance or special exception request, the applicant shall apply for a building permit 
or a certificate of occupancy, as applicable to his particular situation, within 180-calendar-days 
following the date of board action, unless the board specifies a longer time period in the minutes 
of its action. If the applicant fails to apply for a building permit or certificate of occupancy, as 
applicable, within the 180 calendar day timeframe, then the variance or special exception shall 
be deemed to have expired, and all rights thereunder shall be terminated. Such termination 
shall be without prejudice to a subsequent appeal, and such subsequent appeal shall be subject 
to the same regulations and requirements for hearing as specified in this chapter for the original 
variance or special exception request. 
(j) ?Finality of decisions; judicial review; final and binding; petition. All decisions of the board of 
adjustments are final and binding and may not be appealed to the city council. However, any person 
aggrieved by a decision of the board of adjustments may present a verified petition to a court of 
appropriate jurisdiction that states that the decision of the board is illegal, in whole or in part, and 
specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition must be presented within ten calendar days 
after the date the board's decision is filed in the office of the secretary to the board. Subject to the 
provisions of V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.011, only a court with appropriate jurisdiction 
may reverse, affirm or modify a decision of the board of adjustments.

Sec. 50-34. - Amendments to zoning chapter and districts, administrative procedures, and enforcement. 
(a) ?Declaration of policy and review criteria. 
(1) ?The city declares the enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived governing 
the use and development of land, buildings, and structures as a measure necessary to the 
orderly development of the community. Therefore, no change shall be made in this chapter or in 
the boundaries of the zoning districts except: 
a. ?To correct any error in the regulations or map; 
b. ?To recognize changed or changing conditions or circumstances in a particular locality; 
c. ?To recognize changes in technology, the style of living, or manner of conducting business; 
or 
d. ?To change the property to uses in accordance with the city's adopted comprehensive plan. 
(2) ?In making a determination regarding a requested zoning change, the planning and zoning 
commission and the city council shall consider the following factors: 
a. ?Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change will be appropriate in the immediate 
area concerned, and their relationship to the general area and to the city as a whole; 
b. ?Whether the proposed change is in accordance with any existing or proposed plans for 
providing public schools, streets, water supply, sanitary sewers, and other utilities to the 
area; 
c. ?The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar development in the vicinity and 
elsewhere in the city, and any special circumstances which may make a substantial part of 
such vacant land unavailable for development; 
d. ?The recent rate at which land is being developed in the same zoning classification as the 
request, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed change; 
e. ?How other areas designated for similar development will be, or are likely to be, affected if 
the proposed amendment is approved; 
f. ?Any other factors that will substantially affect the public health, safety, morals, or general 
welfare; and

(1) ?Generally. Consideration for: 
a. ?A change in any zoning district boundary line;

development (PD), or for a text amendment to a provision of this chapter, shall be made in 
writing on an application form available in the planning director's office, and shall be 
accompanied by payment of the appropriate fee as established by resolution adopted by the city 
council. 
(3) ?Form developed. The planning director is hereby authorized to develop application forms

(6) ?Official filing date, completeness of application, expiration of application. The following shall 
apply to any application (e.g., concept plan, building permit plan, site plan) submitted in 
accordance with this chapter: 
a. ?Official filing date. The time period established by state law or this chapter for processing or 
deciding an application shall commence on the official filing date. The official filing date for 
a required plan application is the date the application is received by the city. 
b. ?Determination of completeness. Every required plan application shall be subject to a 
determination of completeness within ten business days by the planning director for 
processing the application. 
1. ?No required plan application shall be accepted by the planning director for processing 
unless it is accompanied by all documents required by and prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of this chapter. 
2. ?The incompleteness of the required plan application shall be grounds for denial of the 
application. 
3. ?A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of compliance 
with the substantive requirements of this chapter. 
4. ?A determination of completeness shall be made by the planning director in writing and 
delivered to the applicant no later than the tenth business day after the official filing 
date that the required plan application is submitted to the city. 
(i) ?The applicant shall be notified within that ten-business-day period of the 
determination of completeness. 
(ii) ?If the required plan application is determined to be complete, the application 
shall be acted upon in the proper manner as prescribed by this chapter. 
(iii) ?If the required plan application is determined to be incomplete, the notification 
shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the 
application and shall state the date the application will expire (see subsection 
(b)(6)c of this section) if the documents or other information is not provided. 
(iv) ?A required plan application shall be deemed complete on the 11th business day 
after the application has been received if the applicant has not otherwise been 
notified that the application is incomplete. 
c. ?Expiration of application. The required plan application shall expire on the 45th calendar 
day after the date the application is filed if: 
1. ?The applicant fails to provide documents or other information necessary to comply 
with the city's requirements relating to the required plan application; 
2. ?The city provides to the applicant, not later than the tenth business day after the date 
the application is filed, written notice that specifies the necessary documents or other 
information, and the date the application will expire if the documents or other 
information is not provided; and 
3. ?The applicant fails to provide the specified documents or other information within the 
time provided in the notification. If the required plan application is not completed by 
the 45th calendar day after the application is submitted to the responsible official, the 
required plan application will be deemed to have expired and it will be returned to the 
applicant together with any accompanying applications. 
d. ?Resubmittal. If the required plan application is resubmitted after a notification of 
incompleteness, the timeframe for a determination of completeness described in 
subsection (b)(6)3 of this section shall begin on the date of the resubmittal of the required 
plan application. 
(c) ?Notice of public hearing. 
(1) ?Public hearing for zoning changes involving real property. For zoning and rezoning requests 
involving real property (including PD and CUP requests), the planning and zoning commission 
and the city council shall hold at least one public hearing on each zoning application, as per 
applicable state law (V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 211). 
a. ?Notice of the public hearing to occur before the planning and zoning commission shall be 
accomplished by publishing the purpose, time and place of the public hearing in the official 
newspaper of the city before the eighth calendar day prior to the date of the public hearing. 
b. ?Notice of the public hearing to occur before the city council shall be accomplished by 
publishing the purpose, time and place of the public hearing in the official newspaper of the 
city before the 15th calendar day prior to the date of the public hearing. 
c. ?Written notice of the public hearing before the planning and zoning commission shall also 
be sent to all owners of property, as indicated by the most recently approved city tax roll, 
that is located within the area of application and within 200 feet of any property affected 
thereby, said written notice to be sent before the tenth calendar day prior to the date such 
hearing is held. Such notice shall be served by using the last known address as listed on 
the most recently approved tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the regular 
United States mail. If written notice as required is not sent before the tenth calendar day 
prior to the date of the hearing, then the hearing must be delayed until this notice 
requirement is met. 
(2) ?Public hearing for zoning changes involving ordinance text. For requests involving proposed 
changes to the text of the zoning chapter, notice of the planning and zoning commission hearing 
shall be accomplished by publishing the purpose, time and place of the public hearing in the 
official newspaper of the city before the eighth calendar day prior to the date of the public 
hearing. Notice of the city council hearing shall be accomplished by publishing the purpose, 
time and place of the public hearing in the official newspaper of the city before the 15th calendar 
day prior to the date of the public hearing. Changes in the chapter text which do not change 
zoning district boundaries (i.e., which do not involve specific real property) do not require written 
notification to individual property owners. 
(3) ?Dual notification of planning and zoning commission public hearings and city council public 
hearings. The city may, at its option, publish the required zoning change notifications in 
conformance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 211 for public hearings for the planning 
and zoning commission and the city council at the same time; said notifications must be 
published eight days prior to the planning and zoning commission public hearing and 15 days 
prior to the city council public hearing. 
(4) ?Joint public hearings. The city council may hold a joint public hearing on a zoning, rezoning or 
zoning chapter text amendment request along with the planning and zoning commission, but the 
city council shall not take action on the request until it has received a final recommendation from 
the commission. Notification for a joint public hearing shall be accomplished by publishing the 
purpose, time and place of the joint public hearing in the official newspaper of the city before the 
15th calendar day prior to the date of the public hearing. In accordance with V.T.C.A., Local 
Government Code § 211.007, the city council shall prescribe any other necessary methods of 
notification for joint public hearings. 
(5) ?Additional rules and procedures established. The city council may, at its option, establish 
additional rules and procedures for public notification of proposed zoning changes and 
development proposals (e.g., required plans, plats, etc.) which may include, but not be limited 
to, the posting of a signs on any property that is proposed for a zoning change or development 
by the applicant or its agents. Knowledge of and adherence to such rules and procedures, if so 
established by the city, shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be required as part 
of a zoning change or development application. 
(d) ?Failure to appear. Failure of the applicant or his authorized representative to appear before the 
planning and zoning commission or the city council for more than one hearing without an approved 
delay by the city manager, or his designee, shall constitute sufficient grounds for the planning and 
zoning commission or the city council to table or deny the application unless the city manager or his 
designee is notified in writing by the applicant at least 72 hours prior to the hearing. If the agenda 
item is tabled, the planning and zoning commission shall specify a specific date at which it will be 
reconsidered. 
(e) ?Planning and zoning commission consideration and recommendation. 
(1) ?Accordance with section 50-32. The planning and zoning commission shall function in 
accordance with section 50-32 and with applicable provisions in this Code. 
(2) ?Tabling of the decision/recommendation. The planning and zoning commission may, on its own 
motion or at the applicant's request, table its decision/recommendation for not more than 90 
calendar days from the time the public hearing was first opened. Such tabling shall specifically 
state the time period of the tabling by citing the meeting date whereon the request will reappear 
on the commission's agenda, and further notice in the newspaper and to surrounding property 
owners shall not be required. 
(3) ?Recommending approval. When the commission is ready to act upon the zoning request, it 
may recommend approval of the request as it was submitted by the applicant, approval of the 
request subject to certain conditions, or disapproval of the request. The request will then be 
forwarded to the city council for public hearing (see subsection (f)(2) of this section). The 
commission may recommend more restrictive uses, area requirements, restrictions or a zoning 
district than was requested in the original application and included in the advertised and written 
notice. In no case, however, may a use, area requirement or restriction that is considered less 
restrictive or a less restrictive zoning district than was requested in the original application and 
included in the advertised and written notice be recommended. 
(4) ?Recommending denial. If the planning and zoning commission recommends denial of the 
zoning change request, it shall provide reasons to the applicant for the denial, if requested by 
the applicant. The planning and zoning chairperson shall inform the applicant of the right to 
receive reasons for the denial. The recommendation of denial will then be forwarded to the city 
council for public hearing (see subsection (f)(2) of this section). 
(f) ?City council authority and consideration. 
(1) ?City council authority. The city council, after receiving a recommendation by the planning and 
zoning commission and after public hearings required by law, may amend, supplement, or 
change the regulations of this chapter or the boundaries of the zoning districts on the zoning 
map. 
(2) ?Applications forwarded to the city council. After consideration by the planning and zoning 
commission, all zoning applications shall be automatically forwarded to the city council for a 
public hearing following appropriate public hearing notification as prescribed in subsection (f)(1) 
of this section. 
(3) ?City council action on zoning, rezoning or text amendment requests. After a public hearing is 
held before the city council regarding the zoning application, the city council may: 
a. ?Approve the request in whole or in part (if the city council approves the request, then 
subsection (f)(5) of this section will apply); 
b. ?Modify and approve the request to any more restrictive uses, area requirements, 
restrictions or zoning district than was requested in the original application and included in 
the advertised and written notice. In no case, however, may a use, area requirement or 
restriction that is considered less restrictive or a less restrictive zoning district than was 
requested in the original application and included in the advertised and written notice be 
approved; 
c. ?Deny the request in whole or in part; 
d. ?Table the application to a future meeting (and specifically citing the city council meeting to 
which it is tabled); or 
e. ?Refer the application back to the planning and zoning commission for further study. 
(4) ?Protests. For zoning and rezoning requests involving real property (including PD and CUP 
requests), a favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the city council shall be required to 
approve any change in zoning when written objections are received from the owners of 20 
percent or more of the land area covered by the proposed change, or of the land area within 
200 feet of the subject property, in accordance with the provisions of V.T.C.A., Local 
Government Code § 211.006 (commonly referred to as the "20 percent rule"). If a protest 
against such proposed zoning change has been filed with the city secretary, duly signed and 
acknowledged by the owners of 20 percent or more, either of the area of the land included in 
such a proposed change or those owners of property immediately adjacent to the subject 
property and extending 200 feet therefrom, such zoning change shall not become effective 
except by a three-fourths vote of the full city council. 
(5) ?Final approval and ordinance adoption. Upon approval of the zoning request by the city council, 
the applicant shall submit all related material with revisions, if necessary, to the city manager (or 
his designee) for the preparation of the amending ordinance. The amending ordinance will be 
prepared for adoption when a correct description and all required exhibits have been submitted 
to the city manager or his designee. The amending ordinance shall be effective at such time 
that it is adopted by the city council, signed by the mayor, and attested by the city secretary. 
(g) ?Administration and enforcement. 
(1) ?Authority to enforce chapter. The city manager, or his designee, shall be authorized by the city 
council to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. If the city manager (or his 
designee) finds, upon his own personal observation, or upon receipt of a complaint, that the 
provisions of this chapter are being violated, he shall immediately investigate and, when 
necessary, give written notice to the persons responsible to cease or correct such violations 
immediately. Notice may be delivered in person or by certified mail to the violators or to any 
person owning, leasing, or occupying a property where the violation is occurring. The city 
manager, or his designee, shall have the right to enter upon any business premises during 
regular business hours for the purpose of making inspections of buildings or premises that may 
be necessary to carry out the duties in the enforcement of this chapter. The city manager, or his 
designee, shall request permission of a residence owner to enter upon residential premises for 
the purpose of making inspections of buildings or premises that may be necessary to carry out 
the duties in the enforcement of this chapter. If the owner of a residence refuses permission to 
make such inspection or if an inspection of a business is needed after hours or while not open 
to the public, then the city staff may work with the city attorney to obtain a warrant or other legal 
authorization to make such inspections. 
(2) ?Stop work orders. Whenever any building or construction work is being done contrary to the

shall be submitted for approval within two years of the date of approval of a concept plan, 
unless otherwise provided in the PD district adopting ordinance. If a preliminary plat 
consistent with the concept plan is not submitted within such period, the concept plan shall 
expire. 
b. ?Expiration of an approved concept plan. Expiration of an approved concept plan (based on 
subsection (b)(4)a of this section) shall result in suspension of the ability to submit a 
preliminary plat related to the original concept plan. A new concept plan must be submitted 
before the development process can continue. 
c. ?Expiration of an approved preliminary plat. 
1. ?The expiration of an approved preliminary plat shall be governed by the provisions of 
the city's subdivision ordinance as provided in chapter 40. 
2. ?If a required development application (e.g., preliminary plat, final plat, building permit) 
is submitted within the two-year period, but such development application 
subsequently expires, the associated concept plan shall also expire. 
(5) ?Ability to retain the rights to the PD project. In conformance with V.T.C.A., Local Government 
Code § 245.005, the applicant shall retain the following rights related to a proposed planned 
development following submittal and approved of a concept plan. 
a. ?Ability to submit applications for five years. The applicant shall retain the ability to submit a 
new concept plan for a period of five years following the original approval of the concept 
plan. Such new concept plan may only be for a substantially similar PD project. However, 
any such new concept plan shall adhere to any and all new standards and regulations that 
the city has adopted in relation to a concept plan and/or any other PD application 
requirements. 
b. ?Expiration of project in five years. Any PD project for which no preliminary plat has been 
submitted for a period of five years following the approval of the related concept plan shall 
expire on the last day of that five-year period. 
c. ?Planning and zoning commission consideration. After such five-year period has ended and 
the project expires, the planning and zoning commission shall consider whether the 
undeveloped land within a PD district should be changed to another zoning classification in 
accordance with the procedures for a zoning amendment pursuant to section 50-34. The 
commission thereafter shall recommend to the city council whether the right to submit a 
preliminary plat or other development application for the same PD project should be 
reinstated, or whether the property should be rezoned to another classification. 
d. ?City council consideration. The commission's recommendation (as outlined in subsection 
(b)(5)c of this section) shall be considered by the city council in accordance with 
procedures for a zoning amendment pursuant to section 50-34. The council shall 
determine whether the right to submit the preliminary plat or other development application 
for the same PD District project should be reinstated, or whether the property should be 
rezoned to another classification. In making such determination, the city council shall 
consider the following factors: 
1. ?Whether the PD District remains consistent with the Comprehensive Plan; 
2. ?Whether the uses authorized in the PD District are compatible with existing and 
planned land uses adjacent to the site; 
3. ?Whether there are extenuating circumstances justifying the failure to submit a 
preliminary plat or other development application during the applicable time period; 
and 
4. ?Whether rezoning the property to another classification constitutes confiscation of a 
vested property right or deprives the owner of the economically viable use of the land. 
e. ?Council action. Upon subsections (b)(5)d.2 through 4 of this section occurring, the city 
council may take the following actions: 
1. ?Reinstate the right to submit the preliminary plat or other development application for 
the original PD District project within a certain time period, subject to any conditions 
that may be appropriate to ensure that significant progress will be made toward 
development of land within the PD District; 
2. ?Modify the PD District regulations applicable to the property; or 
3. ?Repeal the PD District for the affected portions of the property and zone such property 
to another zoning district classification. 
(c) ?Vested rights request. 
(1) ?Any property owner who believes that he has obtained a vested right under V.T.C.A., Local 
Government Code ch. 245 shall submit to the city secretary a letter explaining the factual and 
legal bases upon which the property owner relies in his contention that he has a particular 
vested right and, consequently, is exempt or not subject to a particular city order, regulation, 
ordinance, rule, expiration date, or other properly adopted requirement (hereinafter referred to 
collectively as "regulations"). Such written submission shall include, at a minimum, the following: 
a. ?The name, mailing address, phone number and fax number of the property owner (or the 
property owner's duly authorized agent); 
b. ?Identification of the property for which the property owner claims a vested right; 
c. ?Identification of the "project," as that term is defined in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 
245.001(3); 
d. ?Identification of the original application for the first permit in the series of permits required 
for the project, as described in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 245.001(1) and 
245.002(a) and (b); 
e. ?The date that the first permit in the series of permits required for the project was filed with 
the city; 
f. ?A chronology of the history of the project, with special emphasis on facts establishing that 
the project was in progress on or commenced after September 1, 1997, as required by 
V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 245.003; 
g. ?Identification of all city regulations in effect at the time the original application for the permit 
was filed that the owner contends are vested and the owner contends controls the 
approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of an application for a permit, pursuant to 
V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 245.002(a) and (b); 
h. ?Identification of all city regulations that the property owner contends do not apply to the 
project due to the vested rights provided the property owner by V.T.C.A., Local 
Government Code ch. 245; and 
i. ?Identification of all city regulations that the property owner contends would apply to the 
project that predate the regulations the property owner contends do not apply. 
(2) ?If a property owner contends that certain city regulations do not apply to the project, the 
property owner is expected to identify, with particularity, all requirements that the property 
owner contends do not apply. Global references to a particular ordinance, or set of criteria, may 
be deemed insufficient and the city may consider the request for a vested rights determination 
to be incomplete and, hence, not subject to a staff determination at that time. 
(d) ?Vested rights determination. The city secretary shall promptly forward the owner's vested rights 
request pursuant to section 50-37(d), along with any supporting information or documentation 
provided along with the request, to the city manager and city attorney for their respective reviews. 
The city manager, after consultation with the city attorney, shall issue a final administrative 
determination of whether a vested right exists in relation to the project, and shall identify, with 
particularity, all claims for vested rights exists in relation to the project, and shall identify, with 
particularity, all claims for vested rights that have been granted and all claims for vested rights that 
have been denied. Prior to rendering his final determination, the city manager may request a pre-
determination conference with the owner to discuss the owner's vested rights claim and to ensure 
that the nature of the claim is fully and completely understood by the city manager prior to a final 
determination being rendered. 
(e) ?Appeals to the board of adjustments. If the property owner and/or the city council believes that the 
city manager's vested rights determination is in error, the property owner and/or the city council shall 
have the right to appeal such determination to the board of adjustments, which will have jurisdiction 
to hear and decide the appeal pursuant to this chapter and/or V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 
211. The property owner may also request the board of adjustments to grant a variance from the 
regulations at issue under the same standards governing variances for other matters, as set forth in 
this chapter and/or V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 211. The property owner may also request 
the board of adjustments to grant a variance from the regulations at issue under the same standards 
governing variances for other matters, as set forth in this chapter and/or V.T.C.A., Local Government 
Code ch. 211. 
(f) ?Judicial review. Should the property owner, any aggrieved person, and/or the city council be 
dissatisfied with the actions of the board of adjustments, they may avail themselves of all legal 
remedies to review the board of adjustments' decision as set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government 
Code § 211.011. 
(g) ?Binding determination. The city manager's final determination, if not timely appealed to the board of 
adjustments, shall be immediately filed in the city's files related to the project and the determination 
shall be considered binding upon the city and the property owner for the duration of the project. 
Similarly, any decision by the board of adjustments regarding a vested right claim, if not timely 
appealed pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.011, shall be filed in the city's files 
related to the project and the determination shall be considered binding upon the city and the 
property owner for the duration of the project. Notwithstanding the binding nature of the city 
manager's final determination and any ruling by the board of adjustments, the city and the property 
owner may, at any time, enter into a development agreement that, to the extent authorized by law, 
modifies the final determination and the applicable development regulations to be applied to the 
project.

Sec. 50-64. - Zoning district boundaries. 
    The zoning district boundary lines shown on the zoning district map are usually along streets, alleys, 
property lines, or extensions thereof. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown 
on the zoning district map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1) ?Boundaries shown as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways or alleys 
shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(2) ?Boundaries shown as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following 
such lot lines. 
(3) ?Boundaries shown as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such 
city limits. 
(4) ?Boundaries shown as following railroad lines shall be construed to be located along the 
centerline of the railroad right-of-way lines. 
(5) ?Boundaries shown as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, creeks, 
canals, bodies of water, or drainageways shall be construed to follow such centerlines, and in 
the event of change in any such centerlines shall be construed to move with such centerlines. 
(6) ?Boundaries shown as parallel to, or extensions of, features described in subsections (1) 
through (5) of this section shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the 
zoning district map shall be determined by the approximate scale of the map and verified by a 
survey. 
(7) ?Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the city council, or 
whenever such area is franchised for building purposes, the zoning district line adjoining each 
side of such street, alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of 
such vacated street, alley or public way (or to the new property ownership boundary line, if it is 
not determined to be at the former centerline) and all areas so involved shall then and 
henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts. 
(8) ?The zoning classification applied to a tract of land adjacent to a street shall extend to the 
centerline of the street unless, as a condition of zoning approval, it is stated that the zoning 
classification shall not apply to the street. 
(9) ?Where physical features on the ground are at variance with information shown on the zoning 
district map, or if there arises a question as to how or whether a parcel of property is zoned and 
such question cannot be resolved by the application of subsections (1) through (8) of this 
section, then the board of adjustments shall interpret the zoning district boundaries. 
(10) ?If the zoning of property is invalidated by a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the 
property shall be considered classified as AG Agricultural District in the same manner as 
provided for newly annexed territory.

and regulations prescribed herein shall be considered as the minimum requirement unless explicitly 
stated otherwise. 
(b) ?No uses shall be allowed which are prohibited by state or federal law or which operate in excess of 
state or federal environmental, pollution or performance standards as determined by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Texas State Department of Health (TSDH), Texas 
Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC), or any other applicable state or federal agency, as the case 
may be. 
(c) ?No lot upon which a building has been erected shall later be so reduced in area that the setbacks,

(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 5, 2-4-2008) 


Sec. 50-66. - Zoning upon annexation. 
(a) ?Proceedings to establish zoning may be undertaken concurrently with annexation procedures (i.e., 
notified at the same time, public hearings scheduled at the same time as annexation, etc.), however, 
zoning approval and formal adoption of the ordinance establishing zoning must occur after 
annexation approval and adoption have occurred, and as a separate and distinct action by the city 
council. For any period of time following official annexation by the city until a zoning action has been 
officially adopted to zone the land, the interim zoning of the land shall be considered to be 
agricultural (AG), and all zoning and development regulations of the AG zoning district shall be 
adhered to with respect to the development and use of the land. 
(b) ?The initial zoning of a land parcel, whether by initiation of the landowner or by initiation of the city, 
must meet the requirements for notification and public hearings as set forth in section 50-34 and all 
other applicable state laws. 
(c) ?The owner of land to be annexed may submit an application for zoning the property simultaneously 
with submission of the petition for annexation, but no such annexation application may be made 
conditioned upon the approval of any particular zoning classification. 
(d) ?Within an area classified as AG Agricultural: 
(1) ?No permit for the construction of a building or use of land shall be issued by the building official, 
or his designee, other than a permit which will allow the construction of a building or use 
permitted in the AG Agricultural District, unless and until such territory has been classified in a 
zoning district other than the AG Agricultural District by the city council in the manner prescribed 
by section 50-34, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
(2) ?If plans and preparations for developing a property for a use other than those specified in the 
AG Agricultural District were already in progress prior to annexation of the property into the city, 
in accordance with section 50-37, then the city council may authorize construction of the project 
by a majority vote. Application of this subsection is contingent upon the following: 
a. ?The applicant must be able to demonstrate that plans and other preparations for 
developing the property commenced prior to (i.e., were already in progress at the time of) 
annexation into the city. 
b. ?Existing land uses shall be allowed to continue in conformance with V.T.C.A., Local 
Government Code ch. 43 and section 50-37. 
(e) ?In its deliberations concerning authorization to proceed with construction of a project which meets 
the criteria in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, the city council shall take into consideration 
the appropriate land use for the area as shown on the city's future land use plan . Upon approval by 
the city council, the city manager or his designee shall notify the building official or his designee of 
such approval. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 6, 2-4-2008)

for the ranching, propagation and cultivation of crops and similar uses of vacant land. Single-family 
uses on large lots are also appropriate for this district. Territory that has been newly annexed into the 
city may be initially zoned agricultural, and the district is considered a temporary holding zone until 
permanent zoning is approved. It is anticipated that agricultural zoned land will ultimately be rezoned 
to another zoning classification for its intended use in accordance with the comprehensive plan in the 
future. Zoning to the final, permanent classification will be considered an initial rezoning for the 
purposes of notice and protest requirements. The AG Agricultural District is also appropriate for 
areas where utilities or city services are not readily available. 
(b) ?Permitted uses. 
(1) ?Those uses listed for the AG Agricultural District in the use charts (section 50-82) as "P" or "C" 
are authorized uses permitted by right or conditionally permitted uses, respectively. 
(2) ?Livestock and domesticated animals shall only be allowed in accordance with the adopted 
ordinances of the city. 
(3) ?One manufactured home may be utilized as a temporary construction living quarters by the 
owner of the property, so long as a valid permit exists and construction is proceeding. In 
addition, non-occupied storage buildings may be allowed without a main structure for as long as 
a valid permit for construction of a main structure is valid. 
(c) ?Height regulations. The maximum height in the AG district shall be: 
(1) ?Three stories, and not to exceed 45 feet, for the main building/house. 
(2) ?Forty-five feet for agricultural structures (e.g., barns, silos, water towers, etc.), provided they 
are no closer than 100 feet from any residential structure on the premises, and they are set 
back at least 100 feet or three times their height (whichever is greater) from any front, side or 
rear property line. 
(3) ?Twenty-five feet for other accessory buildings, including detached garage, garden shed, 
accessory dwelling units, etc. 
(d) ?Area regulations. 
(1) ?Size of lots. 
a. ?Minimum lot area: One acre (i.e., 43,560 square feet). 
b. ?Minimum lot width: 100 feet. 
c. ?Minimum lot depth: 200 feet. 
(2) ?Size of yard. 
a. ?Minimum front yard: 60 feet. 
b. ?Minimum side yard: 30 feet; provided, however, a detached single-family dwelling and 
private garage may be located not less than 15 feet from the side property line or not less 
than 25 feet from the side property line adjacent to an arterial street, whichever is greater. 
c. ?Minimum rear yard: 25 feet for the main building and any accessory buildings. 
(3) ?Maximum coverage lot. Maximum lot coverage is 40 percent for main buildings and accessory 
buildings. 
(4) ?Minimum floor area. Minimum floor area per dwelling unit is 1,600 square feet of heated and/or 
air-conditioned floor area.

Sec. 50-79. - Old Town and Mixed-Use District (OT and MU). 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. 
(1) ?Old Town is an area in which many diverse land uses currently exist. The nature of the area, 
therefore, is a mixture of retail, commercial and other nonresidential uses, along with single-
family homes and multiple-family uses. The city's comprehensive plan (the future land use plan) 
endorses the continuation of the mixture of uses in this area of the city, and specifically states 
that Retail, Office, Single-Family, Duplex (Two-Family) and Multifamily are the most appropriate 
uses in these areas. In addition, to serve existing residential areas and their successful 
integration with future nonresidential uses, increased pedestrian access would be beneficial. 
The Old Town and Mixed Use District is intended to provide a zoning mechanism for a variety of 
uses in the original town site and those areas that have a diverse mixture of uses. 
(2) ?The development standards in the Old Town area are designed to maintain and encourage 
development and redevelopment within the central business section (old downtown) of the city. 
Standards for the district are generally intended to regulate development such that new 
structures look similar to existing ones within this section of the city. They are also intended to 
preserve and enhance the image, character and unique qualities of the city's historic original 
business district. Pedestrian activity and access is also of extreme importance within this 
district. Pedestrian spaces shall be treated with amenities that are selected based upon their 
ability to unify the streetscape with the area's historic past. It is important that elements such as 
construction materials, colors, textures and fixture design complement the area's historic 
qualities. These features shall be repeated throughout the streetscape so as to unify the district 
as a whole. The following pedestrian-oriented areas are permitted: 
a. ?Public art spaces; 
b. ?Monuments (e.g., statues, benches, fountains); 
c. ?Playgrounds; 
d. ?Transit waiting areas; 
e. ?Museums; 
f. ?Plazas; 
g. ?Performing art buildings; and 
h. ?Outdoor eating areas. 
(3) ?The Old Town and Mixed Use District is also intended for those areas outside the Old Town 
area that either currently have or are suitable for a mixture of retail, commercial and other 
nonresidential uses, along with single-family homes and multifamily uses and are designated for 
such mixed use on the adopted comprehensive plan. Proposed planned mixed use 
development may also and is encouraged to utilize a Planned Development District with its 
flexibility. 
(4) ?For the purposes of this district and its regulations, the term Old Town Area shall be defined to 
include all lots shown on the revised map filed of record with the county on July 8, 1912, a true 
and correct copy of which is on file in the office of the city secretary, and which is identified as 
the Old Town Tomball Map. 
(b) ?Permitted uses. Those uses listed for the OT and MU district in the use charts (section 50-82) as "P" 
or "C" are authorized uses permitted by right or conditionally permitted uses, respectively. 
(c) ?Height regulations. The maximum height in the OT and MU district shall be: 
(1) ?Two stories for the main building. A three or four story building may be allowed with a 
conditional use permit. 
(2) ?One story for accessory buildings. 
(d) ?Area regulations for residential uses.

c. ?Minimum lot depth: 100 feet. 
d. ?Two or more lots of record in existence on the adoption date of the ordinance from which 
this chapter is derived that do not meet these area requirements and are under the same 
ownership may be combined into one parcel meeting the requirements of this district. Such 
parcel shall be considered one lot and all required yards shall be measured from the new 
lot lines not owned in common. No lot shall be created that has a front yard with less than 
50 feet of frontage on the front street. 
(2) ?Size of yards. 
a. ?Minimum area requirements for a single-family residence shall be the same as the SF-6 
district. 
b. ?Minimum area requirements for a Duplex (Two-Family) or Duplex Townhome shall be the 
same as the Duplex District. 
c. ?Minimum area requirements for a multifamily complex shall be the same as the MF district 
unless otherwise specified herein. 
d. ?Minimum front yard: 20 feet. Where lots have double frontage, running through from one 
street to another, the required front yard shall be provided on both streets. 
e. ?Minimum side yard: five feet; ten feet for a corner lot. 
f. ?Minimum rear yard is ten feet; the minimum rear yard where lots back on a designated 
arterial street shall not be less than 25 feet. However, lots backing up to a 20 foot alley

county, as applicable, on or before November 1, 1999. 
(3) ?Minimum floor area. Minimum floor area per dwelling unit is 650 square feet of heated and/or 
air conditioned floor area. 
(4) ?Nonconforming lots. Where a lawfully existing lot having less area, depth, or width than 
required existed in separate ownership on the effective date of Ordinance No. 2004-09, the 
regulations required by this section relating to the size of such lot shall not prohibit the erection 
of a single-family dwelling thereon. 
(e) ?Area regulations for nonresidential uses. 
(1) ?Size of lot. 
a. ?Minimum lot area: 5,000 square feet. 
b. ?Minimum lot width: 50 feet.

Street, and Commerce Street may have a zero front building line. 
c. ?Minimum side and rear yard is ten feet or ten percent of the lot width if less than 100 feet of 
lot width when adjacent to a nonresidential zoning district or use. If adjacent to a Single-
Family, Duplex (Two-Family), Patio Home or Single-Family Attached District or use, then 
side and/or rear setback shall be a minimum of 20 feet. Corner lots shall maintain a ten 
side yard setback. 
d. ?Interior side yards: when retail uses are platted adjacent to other retail uses and integrated 
into an overall shopping center site (i.e., lots/lease spaces abutting one another), no side 
yard is required provided it complies with the city's building code. 
e. ?Old Town area required yard and building line exceptions. A commercial building 
constructed in the Old Town area before August 16, 1999, and which does not comply with 
the building lines set forth above, may expand in size provided it maintains a minimum ten-
foot front building line and a minimum ten-foot side building line, provided the owner 
demonstrates and the chief building official determines that the use as conducted and 
managed, or as proposed, has minimal incompatibilities with the neighborhood. Factors 
used to evaluate this include: 
1. ?That management practices eliminate problems such as noise, waste materials, 
competition for on-street parking, or similar conflicts. 
2. ?The use's history of code enforcement complaints against it. 
3. ?That the use has been maintained in good condition or that the nonconformity 
represents a disincentive for such maintenance. 
4. ?Appeal of the chief building official's determination shall be to the planning and zoning 
commission with the same notice requirements to adjacent property owners as to the 
board of adjustments. 
f. ?Vacant land, or lots or tracts formerly used as residential property, may be developed for 
commercial use without conforming to the building line requirements of this chapter if the 
property owner or his agent establishes the following: 
1. ?Three or more properties within a three-block distance, whether on the same side of 
the street or across the street, have the same nonconformity; and 
2. ?Proposed development plans for the property are no more nonconforming than 
existing properties on the same street and maintain the same character as existing 
buildings. 
(f) ?Special requirements. 
(1) ?Building facade plan. The architectural style and scale of new/renovated buildings within the 
Old Town area on lots fronting on Commerce, Main, Market Streets between Elm and Pine 
Streets shall be compatible with the styles and scale of other adjacent buildings, and shall be 
historically accurate to the greatest extent possible in order to preserve the unique character of 
the city's downtown area. Therefore: 
a. ?In addition to the building permit plan which is required by sections 50-35 and 50-36, a 
building facade plan shall also be required within the above-mentioned Old Town area for 
new buildings and additions of more than 50 percent of the original structure's size. The 
building facade plan shall be submitted in conjunction with the building permit plan 
application. 
b. ?The building facade plan shall clearly show how any new structure and/or any structure 
that is undergoing major exterior renovations will look. Especially significant is the way in 
which such structures will be viewed from the thoroughfare or alley upon which the 
property faces and/or sides, and shall portray a reasonably accurate depiction of the 
materials to be used. 
c. ?Review, approval and appeal procedures shall be the same as the procedures for a 
building permit plan, as outlined in section 50-36.

information and materials (possibly actual samples of materials to be used) additional to 
those initially submitted by the applicant during the building facade plan review process. 
(2) ?Residential uses. 
a. ?Single-family uses. Single-family uses shall be permitted and shall be compatible with 
existing surrounding single-family homes.

uses, wherein at least one floor of the building is dedicated to nonresidential use. Such 
structure shall meet the area requirements of the nonresidential use, provided parking is 
provided for all uses. 
c. ?Multifamily residential uses. Multifamily residential uses shall be permitted within the Old 
Town and Mixed Use District in accordance with the following standards: 
1. ?All dwelling units shall have ground-floor exterior access, which does not include 
access into a garage or access from a garage into a dwelling unit; 
2. ?All dwelling units shall have a front porch space of at least eight square feet located in 
front of the front door; 
3. ?All dwelling units shall have a pitched or gabled roof. Flat roofs shall be permitted to 
allow for the incorporation of terraces; 
4. ?Each dwelling unit shall have varying architectural elevations including varying 
rooflines, windows, stoop styles, etc.; and 
5. ?Exemptions to these standards may be made during the city's review process if the 
multifamily use is developed/constructed above (i.e., is located within a second or 
third story) a nonresidential use. 
(3) ?Nonresidential design standards for the Old Town area. 
a. ?Facades. 
1. ?Existing nonresidential buildings. False fronts or parapets may be added to existing 
buildings in order to add character and detail to simple facades. 
2. ?Newly constructed nonresidential buildings. Any new facade shall avoid long, 
monotonous, uninterrupted exterior walls wherever such facades are publicly visible. 
No more than 20 feet of horizontal distance of exterior wall shall be provided without 
facade articulation/architectural relief for any facade facing a street right-of-way or 
pedestrian-oriented area (refer to subsection (f)(3)e of this section). Facade 
articulation/architectural relief can include pilasters, windows, entrances, arcades, 
awnings/canopies, or other types of building massing that modulates the building 
mass or surface texture. 
b. ?Exterior finishes. Predominant exterior finish shall be fired brick or other masonry materials. 
Materials other than fired brick shall be considered during the plan review process, and 
determination of approval shall be based upon whether such materials are: 
1. ?Similar in appearance and quality to fired brick; 
2. ?Similar in appearance to original materials used within the Old Town area; and/or 
3. ?Cementious fiberboard such as Hardi-plank may be approved where the appearance 
is similar in appearance to the original materials used within the Old Town area. The 
use of glass material shall be permitted for less than 70 percent of the exterior facade 
of a structure. Trim (i.e., lintels, sills, door jambs, cornices and other similar items) 
shall be brick, cast stone, stone, cast or wrought iron, or concrete, and colors shall be 
complementary to the predominant facade colors. Accent colors for friezes, doors and 
door frames, window frames and mullions, awnings, moldings and other similar 
features shall be colors that are complementary to, and compatible with, the spirit and 
intent of the downtown streetscape. Bright or fluorescent colors shall not be permitted 
on any part of any structure. 
c. ?Windows, doors and other openings. Reflective glass shall not be used for windows of any 
structure's first floor; detailing for windows, doors and other openings shall be of wood, 
glass or a metal material that is complementary to the period or building style.

above the top of the second floor of any multiple-story structure at the awnings' 
highest points. Awnings shall not completely obstruct any windows on the building. 
2. ?Projection. Since awnings must extend beyond the building face, a reasonable 
amount of projection shall be allowed. No awning shall extend more than five feet 
outward from the building face/surface. Awnings made in such a manner as to be 
easily removed may encroach into the right-of-way, provided such awnings are at 
least eight feet above the sidewalk or surface, do not have any structural supports 
other than those directly attached to the building and are maintained and not allowed 
to deteriorate or become tattered, rusty, unpainted or unsightly. Awnings encroaching 
along Main Street may also have to get approval from the state department of 
transportation. 
3. ?Colors. A mixture of colors is recommended, but no more than three different colors 
shall be used for awnings on a single building facade (excluding business logo, which 
may have more colors). Bright or fluorescent colors shall not be permitted. 
4. ?Materials. Materials shall be of cloth, canvas, or metal, or another material that is 
complementary to the period or building style and that is fire retardant. Plastic shall 
not be permitted.

adjacent thereto. Provided further, no off-site parking space shall be designated for use by 
more than one business for the purposes of satisfying such requirements. 
c. ?On-street parking. In the area bounded by Main Street, Market Street, and Commerce 
Street, between Pine and Elm, one parking space credit shall be allowed for every 22 feet 
of development frontage less five feet reserve on either side of driveways and ten-feet 
reserve on street intersections. 
d. ?Off-street parking design standards. Required off-street parking areas within the Old Town 
area shall have individual spaces marked by painted lines or curbs or other means to 
indicate individual spaces. Parking schemes which require the use of adjacent public or

conditions. This section sets forth the standards used to evaluate proposed conditional uses 
and the procedures for approving conditional use permit (CUP) applications. 
(2) ?Permit required. No conditional use shall be established and no building permit shall be issued 
for any use designated as a conditional use within any zoning district until a conditional use 
permit (CUP) is approved and issued in accordance with the provisions of this section and 
section 50-34. An application for a CUP shall be accompanied by a concept plan prepared in 
the manner described in subsection (e) of this section.

certain conditions, or deny approval of the concept plan. 
(7) ?Revisions to the approved concept plan. 
a. ?Minor revisions/amendments. 
1. ?It is recognized that final architectural and engineering design may necessitate minor 
changes in the approved concept plan. In such cases, the city manager, or his 
designee, shall have the authority to approve minor modifications to an approved 
concept plan. Such minor modifications submitted on an amended concept plan, 
which shall substantially conform to the previously approved concept plan. 
2. ?Submission materials and requirements for approval of an amended concept plan 
shall be as determined by the city manager or his designee. 
b. ?Major revisions. In the event of revisions that are more extensive in nature (i.e., do not 
conform to the description for minor amendments in subsection (e)(7)a of this section), a 
revised concept plan must be resubmitted, reviewed, and approved by the city manager or 
his designee. The city manager or his designee shall have the authority to determine 
whether a revised concept plan warrants a review and approval as outlined in this 
subsection (e). 
3. ?Any proposed or existing building or land use that is newly established, enlarged, 
modified, structurally altered, or otherwise changed from the originally approved 
concept plan shall be deemed a major revision. 
(8) ?Effect of review/approval. The concept plan shall be considered authorization to proceed with 
construction of the site provided all other required city approvals are obtained (such as final plat, 
engineering plans, etc.). 
(9) ?Validity, lapse, and reinstatement of concept plan. Refer to section 50-37. 
(f) ?Standards. 
(1) ?Factors for consideration. When considering applications for a conditional use permit, the city 
shall, on the basis of the concept plan and other information submitted, evaluate the impact of 
the conditional use on, and the compatibility of the use with, surrounding properties and 
neighborhoods to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location. Specific 
considerations shall include the extent to which: 
a. ?The proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the goals, objectives and 
policies contained in the adopted comprehensive plan. 
b. ?The proposed use is consistent with the general purpose and intent of the applicable 
zoning district regulations. 
c. ?The proposed use meets all supplemental standards specifically applicable to the use as 
set forth in this chapter. 
d. ?The proposed use is compatible with and preserves the character and integrity of adjacent 
development and neighborhoods and, as required by the particular circumstances, 
includes improvements or modifications either onsite or within the public rights-of-way to 
mitigate development-related adverse impacts, including, but not limited to: 
1. ?Adequate ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with 
particular reference to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, and access 
in case of fire; 
2. ?Off-street parking and loading areas; 
3. ?Refuse and service areas; 
4. ?Utilities with reference to location, availability, and compatibility; 
5. ?Screening and buffering features to minimize visual impacts, and/or setbacks from 
adjacent uses; 
6. ?Control of signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic 
safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district; 
7. ?Required yards and open space; 
8. ?Height and bulk of structure; 
9. ?Hours of operations; 
10. ?Exterior construction material and building design; and 
11. ?Roadway adjustments, traffic control devices or mechanisms, and access restrictions 
to control traffic flow or divert traffic as may be needed to reduce or eliminate 
development-generated traffic on neighborhood streets. 
e. ?The proposed use is not materially detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience 
and welfare, or results in material damage or prejudice to other property in the vicinity. 
(2) ?Conditions. In approving the application, the planning and zoning commission may 
recommend, and the city council may impose, such additional conditions (e.g., hours of 
operation) as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the standards, purpose, and 
intent of this section, and in accordance with the rezoning procedures in section 50-34. Any 
conditions imposed shall be set forth in the ordinance approving the conditional use, and shall 
be incorporated into or noted on the concept plan. The city manager or his designee shall verify 
that the concept plan incorporates all conditions set forth in the ordinance authorizing the 
conditional use. The city shall maintain a record of such approved conditional uses and related 
conditions attached thereto. 
(3) ?Prohibition on waivers and variances. The foregoing additional conditions (i.e., standards of 
development for the CUP) shall not be subject to variances that otherwise could be granted by 
the board of adjustments, nor may conditions imposed by the city council subsequently be 
waived or varied by the board of adjustments. 
(g) ?Other regulations. The board of adjustments shall not have jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or 
modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to the specific land use designated by any 
conditional use permit. 
(h) ?Use regulations. Uses allowed by CUPs are specified in section 50-82 (specifically shown with a "C" 
within the use charts).

Sec. 50-82. - Use regulations (charts). 
(a) ?Conformance with the use charts. 
(1) ?Generally. The use of land and/or buildings shall be in accordance with those listed in the 
following use charts. No land or building shall hereafter be used and no building or structure 
shall be erected, altered, or converted other than for those uses specified in the zoning district 
in which it is located. The legend for interpreting the permitted uses in the use charts are:

(2) ?Unlisted uses. If a use is not listed (or is blank) in the use charts, it is not allowed in any zoning 
district (see subsection (a)(4) of this section). 
(3) ?Use chart organization. The land uses are listed in the use charts in alphabetical order. 
(4) ?Classification of new/unlisted uses. It is recognized that new types of land use will arise in the 
future, and forms of land use not presently anticipated may seek to locate in the city. In order to 
provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification 
of any new or unlisted form of land use in the use charts shall be made as follows: 
a. ?Initiation. 
1. ?A person, city department, the planning and zoning commission, or the city council 
may propose zoning amendments to regulate new and previously unlisted uses. 
2. ?A person requesting the addition of a new or unlisted use shall submit to the city 
manager or his designee, all information necessary for the classification of the use, 
including but not limited to the following: 
(i) ?The nature of the use and whether the use involves dwelling activity, sales, 
services, or processing; 
(ii) ?The type of product sold or produced under the use; 
(iii) ?Whether the use has enclosed or outside storage and the amount and nature of 
the storage; 
(iv) ?Anticipated employment typically anticipated with the use; 
(v) ?Transportation requirements; 
(vi) ?The nature and time of occupancy and operation of the premises; 
(vii) ?The off-street parking and loading requirements; 
(viii) ?The amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic materials and vibration likely to 
be generated; 
(ix) ?The requirements for public utilities such as sanitary sewer and water and any 
special public services that may be required; and 
(x) ?Impervious surface coverage. 
b. ?The city manager, or his designee, shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted 
use to the planning and zoning commission, requesting a recommendation as to the zoning 
classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation 
question shall be accompanied by the statement of facts in subsection (a)(4)a.2 of this 
section. An amendment to this chapter shall be required as prescribed by section 50-34. 
c. ?The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance 
of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts and 
determine the zoning district or districts within which such use is most similar and should 
be permitted (by right or by CUP). 
d. ?The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to 
the city council as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city 
council shall approve or disapprove the recommendation of the planning and zoning 
commission or make such determination concerning the classification of such use as is 
determined appropriate based upon its findings. If approved, the new or unlisted use shall 
be amended in the use charts of subsection(b) of this section according to section 50-34. 
e. ?Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted by the city manager, or his 
designee, as those of a similar use. When a determination of the appropriate zoning district 
cannot be readily ascertained, the same criteria outlined in subsection (a)(b) of this section 
shall be followed for determination of the appropriate district. The decision of the city 
manager, or his designee, may be appealed according to the process outlined in 
subsections (a)(4)a2 through (a)(4)d of this section. 
(b) ?Use charts.

(b) ?Residential districts; off-street parking provisions. 
(1) ?Parking regulations for the AG, SF-20-E, SF-9, SF-6, and D Districts and for Planned 
Developments for zero lot line, patio home, townhome and single-family attached dwelling units. 
For every single-family dwelling unit, a minimum of two off-street parking spaces shall be 
provided on the same lot as the main structure. For duplexes, two off-street parking spaces for 
each dwelling unit shall be required. For the purposes of this subsection, the first two parking 
spaces contained in covered garages and/or covered carports for each dwelling unit shall not be 
considered as off-street parking spaces. For example, if a dwelling has a three-car garage, one 
additional off-street parking space would be required in addition to that included within the 
garage. For the purposes of this subsection, the minimum dimensions of each parking space 
shall be in accordance with Table 50-112-1; provided, however, two spaces shall be not less 
than 12 feet by 40 feet if aligned linearly. All required driveways and parking areas shall have a 
topping, which is the same as the abutting street, or they may be concrete cement. All additional 
parking in a required yard must also be of the same material as the abutting street or concrete 
cement. 
(2) ?Parking regulations for the MHP District. 
a. ?Tenant/owner parking. Two spaces per unit located on the same lot as the unit served. 
Each parking space shall be in accordance with city standards, and shall be located to 
eliminate interference with access to parking areas provided for other manufactured/mobile 
homes and for public parking in the park. 
b. ?Visitor and supplemental parking. In addition to parking spaces required for each 
manufactured/mobile home unit, there shall be parking provided for the 
manufactured/mobile home community in general in compliance with the following: 
1. ?One visitor parking space for every three manufactured/mobile home spaces. 
2. ?Boats, campers, trailers and other recreational vehicles shall be prohibited unless 
oversize parking areas are provided and are approved by the city. This parking area 
shall not be used to meet the minimum parking requirements and shall not be visible 
from a public street. 
3. ?Each parking space will be not less than nine feet by 20 feet (nine feet by 20 feet), or 
as required in Table 50-112-1, which is not to be included in the lot size. 
(3) ?All required vehicle parking shall be on a concrete or asphalt paved surface. 
(4) ?All driveways and approaches to parking spaces shall be on a concrete or asphalt paved 
surface, except in the AG District. 
(5) ?All existing driveways within the Old Town area as of the effective date of this chapter shall be 
deemed as conforming (unless they represent a threat to public health, safety and welfare, in 
which case the city may require removal and/or relocation and/or refurbishment). 
(6) ?No required parking space, garage, carport, or other automobile storage space shall be used 
for the storage of any heavy load vehicle (see definitions section). No such vehicle shall be 
stored or parked for more than 72 hours within a 30-calendar-day period or on a regular, 
repetitive basis on any street, or within any front yard or street side yard. Such a vehicle shall be 
parked in a space that is located on a concrete or asphalt paved surface. 
(7) ?Additional parking shall be required in accordance with this section for any recreational uses, 
clubhouse, office, sales offices and other similar accessory structures and uses. 
(c) ?Nonresidential and MF Districts; off-street parking provisions. 
(1) ?Parking regulations for the MF District. 
a. ?Off-street parking. Each dwelling unit within a multifamily dwelling complex shall be 
provided with on-site off-street parking as follows: 
1. ?Two parking spaces for each one bedroom unit; 
2. ?Two and one-half parking spaces for each two bedroom unit; and 
3. ?Three parking spaces for each three bedroom unit. 
b. ?All parking areas shall be constructed of the same material as the adjoining street, or of 
concrete cement. No on-street parking shall be counted as meeting the requirements of 
this chapter and may be restricted or prohibited by the city. All parking areas shall be 
separated from walkways, sidewalks, streets, or alleys by a wall, fence, curbing, or other 
protection device in accordance herewith and in accordance with other applicable city 
specifications. 
c. ?Covered parking and density bonuses. 
1. ?An increase in density of a total of up to 24 units per acre is permitted when at least 
50 percent of the required parking spaces are constructed as covered or enclosed 
spaces. 
2. ?An increase in density of a total of up to 26 units per acre is permitted when 100 
percent of the required parking spaces are constructed as covered or enclosed 
spaces. 
d. ?No parking space may be located closer than six feet from any building or closer than two 
feet from any side or rear lot line. 
(2) ?To prevent nuisance situations, all parking area lighting shall be designed, shielded and 
operated so as not to reflect or shine on adjacent properties and in accordance with city 
ordinances. All streets and driveways shall be lighted at night with a minimum intensity of two 
foot-candles' illumination if off-street parking or loading facilities are to be used at night. 
(3) ?For safety and fire-fighting purposes, free access through to adjacent nonresidential parking 
areas shall be provided in accordance with section subsection (j) of this section.

requirements. All such areas shall be drained to prevent damage to abutting properties and/or 
public streets and alleys. 
(5) ?For new construction only, all vehicle maneuvering shall take place onsite. No public right-of-
way shall be used for backing or maneuvering into or from a parking space (except business 
locations in the downtown area that are already in existence as of the effective date of the 
ordinance from which this chapter is derived), or for circulation within the parking lot. 
a. ?All entrances into parking lots shall be at least 20 feet in width, or a maximum of 40 feet in 
width. 
b. ?Divided entrances into parking lots shall have a minimum ingress lane of 18 feet, a 
minimum landscaped median width of five feet for an unbroken distance of at least 100 
feet, and a minimum egress lane of 22 feet. All divided entrances shall be a maximum of 
45 feet in width. 
(6) ?In all nonresidential and multifamily zoning districts, the perimeter of all parking lots and 
driveways shall be provided with concrete curbs. Parking shall not be permitted to encroach 
upon the public right-of-way. 
(7) ?Refuse storage facilities placed in a parking lot shall not be located in a designated parking or 
loading space. Each refuse facility shall be located so as to facilitate pickup by refuse collection 
agencies and ease of egress from the site without having to back up further than 20 feet and 
without having to go the wrong way in a traffic aisle. 
(8) ?Parking spaces for persons with disabilities and other associated provisions (e.g., clear and 
unobstructed pathways into building, crosswalks across parking lots, etc.) shall be provided 
according to building codes, state laws, and requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA). 
(9) ?Designated parking and loading areas shall not be used for the repair, storage, dismantling or 
servicing (except for normal maintenance of a private vehicle) of vehicles or equipment, or for 
the storage of materials or supplies, or for any other use in conflict with the designated parking 
and loading areas (i.e., advertising or outside storage of raw materials). 
(10) ?To ensure that all requirements set forth in this section are carried forward, it will be the 
responsibility of the owner of the parking area to adequately maintain the facility. All off-street 
parking areas shall be kept free of trash, debris, vehicle repair operation or display and 
advertising uses. At no time after initial approval of the parking area layout can changes be 
made in the location and number of provided spaces without city approval of a revised plan, as 
described in section 50-36. 
(11) ?A stacking space shall be an area on a site measuring at least eight feet wide by 20 feet long 
that has direct forward access to a service window or station of a drive-through facility and that 
does not constitute space for any other circulation driveway, parking space, or maneuvering 
area. An escape lane of at least eight feet in width and with negotiable geometric design must 
be provided to allow vehicles to get out of the stacking lane if necessary. Off-street stacking 
requirements for drive-through facilities shall be as follows: 
a. ?For financial institutions with drive-through facilities, each teller window or station, human 
or mechanical, shall be provided with a minimum of five stacking spaces. One escape lane 
shall be provided. 
b. ?For each service window of a drive-through restaurant, a minimum of five spaces shall be 
provided for the first vehicle stop, and two spaces shall be provided for each additional 
vehicle stop (order/pick-up windows, etc.). One escape lane shall be provided from the 
beginning of the stacking lane to the first vehicle stop. 
c. ?For a full-service car wash, each vacuum or gas pump lane shall be provided with a 
minimum of four stacking spaces. For the finish/drying area, adequate vehicle stacking and 
storage space must be provided to keep finished vehicles out of circulation aisles, access 
easements, fire lanes, streets, etc. 
d. ?For each automated self-service (drive-through/rollover) car wash bay, a minimum of three 
stacking spaces, in addition to the wash bay itself, shall be provided. One stacking space 
shall be provided at the exit end of each wash bay for window-drying and other detailing. 
e. ?For each wand-type self-service (open) car wash bay, a minimum of two stacking spaces, 
in addition to the wash bay itself, shall be provided. One stacking space shall be provided 
at the exit end of each wash bay for window-drying and other detailing, unless a separate 
area/shade structure is provided (outside of circulation aisles) for these activities. 
f. ?For automobile quick-lube type facilities, a minimum of three stacking spaces shall be 
provided for each service bay in addition to the service bay itself. 
g. ?For all other types of land use that provide drive-up service, a minimum of three stacking 
spaces for each service window shall be provided. 
(12) ?Dead-end parking areas shall be avoided if possible. If dead-end parking is necessary, then it 
shall be designed such that it is no more than five parking spaces deep, unless adequate 
turnaround space is provided. A minimum five-foot deep hammerhead back-up space shall be 
provided at the end of any dead-end parking area. 
(13) ?All parking structures must conform to the construction and design standards of the zoning 
district in which they are located. 
(14) ?A parking analysis and tabulation shall be required on the site plan for each development and 
shall be a part of the site plan submittal. Each analysis shall include an explanation of 
applicable parking requirements (as a minimum, include occupancy classification type, building 
square footages, and number of employees), total parking spaces required and required and 
provided for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible spaces, and required and 
provided ADA van accessible spaces. When the director of public works, or designee 
determines necessary, an additional traffic impact study may be required to determine the 
impacts of a development on the off-site public street system. 
(d) ?Off-street loading spaceAll districts. 
(1) ?All retail and similar nonresidential structures shall provide and maintain off-street facilities for 
receiving and loading merchandise, supplies and materials within a building or on the lot or 
tract. All drives and approaches shall provide adequate space and clearances to allow for the 
maneuvering of trucks off-street. Each site shall provide a designated on-site maneuvering area 
for trucks (see Illustration 50-112-1). Such off-street loading space may be adjacent to (but not 
any portion of) a public alley or private service drive, or it may consist of a truck berth within the 
structure. The minimum dimensions of a "regular" loading space shall be ten feet by 30 feet, 
and a "large" loading space shall be at least ten feet by 65 feet. Loading spaces or berths shall 
be provided as deemed appropriate by the planning director (or designee). 
Illustration 50-112-2: Truck maneuvering related to loading areas 
 
(2) ?Loading docks for any establishment which customarily receives goods between the hours of 
9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. and is adjacent to a residential use or district shall be designed and 
constructed so as to minimize the effects of the noise of the operation on adjacent residences. 
Other screening/buffering alternatives may be approved on the applicable required plan (see 
section 50-116) provided that the city makes a finding that the method of screening/buffering will 
be adequate to protect nearby residences. Below grade loading docks are required to have 
operational sump pumps or other approved drainage. 
(3) ?Kindergartens, elementary schools, day schools, and similar child training and care 
establishments shall provide one paved off-street pedestrian loading and unloading space for 
an automobile on a through, "circular" drive for each ten students cared for (excluding child care 
in a residence). An additional lane shall also be required to allow pass by or through traffic to 
move while automobiles waiting or parked to pick up children occupy loading/unloading areas. 
(4) ?Loading spaces that are adjacent and easily accessible to several buildings or uses, including 
buildings and uses on separate lots, shall be allowed to satisfy the loading requirements for the 
individual buildings or uses. 
(5) ?Loading spaces to be shared among separate lots shall be in reasonably close proximity to all 
potential users and an agreement granting mutual use by the owners of each building shall be 
executed and provided to the city manager (or his designee). 
(e) ?Parking access from a public streetAll districts. 
(1) ?Consideration shall be given to providing entrance/exit drives that extend into the site to 
provide adequate queuing of vehicles on the site. 
(2) ?Entrance/exit drives shall be appropriately designed and located to minimize traffic congestion 
or conflict within the site and with adjoining public streets. Based upon analysis by the city, if 
projected volumes of traffic entering or leaving a development are likely to interfere with the 
projected peak traffic flow volumes on adjoining streets, additional right-of-way and paving in 
the form of a deceleration lane, a turn lane, or other roadway improvements may be required of 
a developer in order to reduce such interference and to help ensure traffic safety and efficiency. 
The dedication of additional right-of-way or street paving may also be required, and shall be 
determined at the time the required plan (see section 50-36) and final plat are approved by the 
city. 
(3) ?Vehicular access to nonresidential uses shall not be permitted from alleys serving residential 
areas, and shall not be configured as "head-in" parking spaces that are accessed directly from 
the street. 
(4) ?Parking space configuration, arrangement, size and circulation in all districts shall be 
constructed according to Illustration 50-112-1 and Table 50-112-1. 
(f) ?Parking requirements based upon use. In all districts, there shall be provided at the time any building 
or structure is erected or structurally altered, or change of use, off-street parking spaces in 
accordance with the use chart, section 50-82. Further descriptive requirements have been included 
herein where applicable, as referenced within the use chart: 
(1) ?Accessory uses. All areas for accessory uses not listed above or in other parts of this section 
(such as restaurants, office, etc.), shall be calculated in with the minimum specified for those 
individual uses. 
(2) ?Auto dealer (new and/or used auto sales); motorcycle sales/dealer; personal watercraft sales 
(new/repair). One parking space for each 500 square feet of sales floor/office and other indoor

sales and parking areas, plus one parking space per repair bay in service areas (indoors or 
outdoors). 
(3) ?Community center (public), museum, library, or art gallery. Ten parking spaces plus one 
additional space for each 300 square feet of floor area in excess of 2,000 square feet. If an 
auditorium is included as a part of the building, its floor area shall be deducted from the total 
and additional parking provided on the basis of one space for each four seats that it contains 
(see section 50-82). 
(4) ?Convenience store (with or without gasoline sales) or gasoline station. One space per 200 
square feet of floor area, plus one parking space for each side of a gasoline pump unit (a unit 
may have up to six nozzles for gasoline disbursement). Spaces within pump areas qualify as 
spaces for the parking requirement. If no gasoline sales are provided, then the parking 
requirements shall be the same as for a retail store. Adequate space shall be provided for 
waiting, stacking, and maneuvering automobiles for refueling. 
(5) ?Funeral home or mortuary. One parking space for each 200 square feet of floor space in 
slumber rooms, parlors or individual funeral service rooms, or one space for each three seats in 
the auditorium/sanctuary (see section 50-82), whichever is greater. Adequate on-site stacking 
spaces shall also be provided for the organization and forming of processions such that these 
activities do not cause excessive or extended traffic congestion/delays on a public roadway. 
(6) ?Golf driving range. 1½ spaces for each driving tee. 
(7) ?Hotel/motel. One space per guest room for the first 250 rooms and 0.75 space per room for 
each room over 250, plus one space per five restaurant/lounge area seats (based upon 
maximum occupancy), plus one space per 125 square feet of meeting/conference areas. 
(8) ?Mini-warehouse/self storage. Four spaces per establishment, plus two spaces for an on-site 
manager's residence (if applicable), plus one appropriately sized space for any type of vehicle 
to be stored on-site (e.g., rental trucks, boats, RVs, etc.) 
(9) ?Motion picture theater (indoors). 
a. ?One space per 3½ seats for single-screen theaters; 
b. ?One space per five seats for motion picture theaters with two or more screens. 
(10) ?Motor freight transportation, storage, and terminal/transit terminal/truck terminal/other similar 
transportation uses. For warehouse and staging/loading areas, one space for each 1,000 
square feet of floor area; for bus depot or other human transportation use, one space per 100 
square feet of passenger waiting area, plus parking spaces for any warehouse and 
staging/loading areas on the premises (as above). 
(11) ?Places of public assembly not otherwise specified. One space for each four seats provided. 
(12) ?Retail or personal service establishment not otherwise specified. One space per 200 square

(14) ?Skilled nursing facility. One space per six beds; plus one parking space for each 300 square 
feet of floor area devoted to offices, cafeterias, exercise/therapeutic rooms, and other similar 
ancillary uses. 
(g) ?Rules for computing number of parking spaces and miscellaneous off-street parking requirements. 
In computing the number of parking spaces required for each of the above uses, the following rules 
shall govern: 
(1) ?The term "floor area" means the gross floor area of the specific use. 
(2) ?The term "seat" shall be interpreted as follows: 
a. ?For fixed (e.g., church pews, grandstands, benches, etc.) seating, one seat equals 1.75 
feet of length; and 
b. ?For flexible (e.g., folding chairs, etc.) seating areas, one seat equals eight square feet of 
floor area occupied by such seating area (includes aisles). 
(3) ?Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be calculated by rounding to 
the nearest whole number. 
(4) ?The parking space requirements for a new or unlisted use not specifically mentioned herein 
shall be the same as required for a use of similar nature. If the proposed use is not similar to 
any of the uses listed herein, a determination shall be made/approved by the city, in conjunction 
with the request for classification of the new or unlisted use, as provided in section 50-82(b). 
(5) ?Whenever a building or use is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of dwelling units, 
seating capacity or otherwise, to create a need for an increase of ten percent or more in the 
number of existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the 
enlargement or change. If a building or use that was in existence prior to the effective date of 
the ordinance from which this chapter is derived is enlarged by more than 50 percent in floor 
area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, then said 
building or use shall be required to conform with the parking requirements herein for the entire 
building or use. 
(6) ?For buildings which have a combination of uses within the same structure or on the same 
premises (such as retail or office), the off-street parking requirement shall be calculated as the 
summation of the parking requirements for each use, and no parking space for one particular 
use shall be allowed to count toward the parking requirement for some other use on the 
premises except in the case of a shared parking arrangement (see subsection (h) of this 
section). 
(7) ?Shared parking. Shared parking may be allowed in the case of mixed uses (different buildings) 
under the following conditions: Up to 50 percent of the parking spaces required for a theater or 
other place of evening entertainment (after 6:00 p.m.), or for a church, may be provided and 
used jointly by banks, offices, and similar uses not normally open, used, or operated during 
evening hours. Shared parking must be on the same parking lot. Reduction due to shared 
parking shall only be allowed if approved by the city on the applicable required plan (see section 
50-36). To ensure retention of the shared parking spaces, each property owner shall properly 
draw and execute an irrevocable mutual parking agreement document expressing the same, 
shall file this agreement in the county real property records, and shall provide a copy of the filed 
agreement to the city prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any use that relies upon 
the parking agreement. 
(h) ?Location of parking spaces. In any case where any additional parking spaces are required and are 
not located on the same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively or 
jointly provided and used, approval by the planning and zoning commission is required subject to the 
following conditions: 
(1) ?Except for location, all other requirements relating to off-street parking shall be met. 
(2) ?Such space shall be conveniently usable without unreasonable: 
a. ?Hazard to pedestrians; 
b. ?Hazard to vehicular traffic; 
c. ?Traffic congestion; or 
d. ?Detriment to the appropriate use of other properties in the vicinity. 
(3) ?A written agreement shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the city attorney and executed by all 
parties concerned, assuring the continued availability of the off-street parking facility for the 
development it is intended to serve. 
(i) ?Use of required parking spacesNonresidential districts. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall 
be used only for these respective purposes and shall not be used for refuse containers, cart corrals, 
recycling kiosks, signs or sign support structures, telecommunications towers or support structures, 
storage or permanent display of boats, trailers, campers, motor vehicles or other goods, materials, or 
products for sale/lease/rent. 
(j) ?Fire lanes. Fire lanes shall be provided in all multifamily (and in some single-family attached) 
developments, manufactured (mobile) home parks, and nonresidential developments, as required by 
the adopted fire code of the city (also see chapter 40, pertaining to subdivisions, for certain fire lane 
regulations). 
(k) ?Special regulations for recreational vehicles or equipment. No recreational vehicle shall be left 
unattended or parked for more than 24 hours within any parking lot, parking spaces, drive aisle, 
vacant or unused property, or pervious/unpaved surface area (except an appropriately zoned and 
approved/paved parking lot for such vehicles). An owner or tenant of a residential lot may park a 
recreational vehicle that they own on the same lot in accordance with city regulations. Such vehicle 
parking must also meet all other required city ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 39, 2-4-2008) 


Sec. 50-113. - Landscape requirements. 
(a) ?Purpose. Landscaping is accepted as adding value to property and is in the interest of the general 
welfare of the city. The provision of landscaped areas also serves to increase the amount of a 
property that is devoted to pervious surface area that, in turn, helps to reduce the amount of 
impervious surface area, stormwater runoff, and consequent non-point pollution in local waterways. 
Therefore, landscaping is hereafter required of new development, except single- and two-family and 
agricultural uses. 
(b) ?Scope and enforcement. 
(1) ?The standards and criteria contained within this section are deemed to be minimum standards 
and shall apply to all new nonresidential and multifamily construction, and shall apply in the 
case of an addition to a nonresidential or multifamily structure or site that alters such structure 
or site by greater than 25 percent. 
(2) ?Any use requiring a conditional use permit (CUP) or a PD Planned Development zoning 
designation must comply with these landscape standards unless special landscaping standards 
are otherwise provided for in the ordinance establishing the CUP or PD District. In no case shall 
the standards provided for in the CUP or PD ordinance be less than the standards required by 
this section. 
(3) ?The provisions of this section shall be administered and enforced by the city manager or his 
designee. 
(4) ?The landscape standards in this section apply only to nonresidential and multifamily 
developments (including uses such as schools and churches within a residential zoning district).

erected on the property line separating zoning districts in the following cases: 
a. ?When a multifamily use, nonresidential use, or manufactured (mobile) home park sides or 
backs upon a single-family, two-family or residential PD District; 
b. ?When any nonresidential use is on a tract, lot or parcel that is less than 15 acres and the 
nonresidential use sides or backs upon a multiple-family district; and 
c. ?When a commercial or industrial use is established on a building site located adjacent to 
any residential area, a ten-foot side landscaped open-space buffer shall be installed and 
maintained by the owner, developer, or operator of the commercial or industrial property 
between it and the adjacent residential area. The provisions of this section shall not apply 
where the residential area is separated by a public street, drainage ditch, or canal with a 
minimum easement of 30 feet. With written approval of the planning and zoning 
commission, and otherwise full compliance with landscaping standards, a required buffer

of-way for all nonresidential, multifamily and manufactured/mobile home park uses shall be 
visually screened by a minimum six-foot solid masonry wall on at least three sides (see 
illustration 50-115-1 for refuse container enclosure diagrams). The fourth side, which is to be 
used for garbage pickup service, shall provide an opaque gate to secure the refuse storage 
area which shall remain closed at all times except when being used for filling, emptying, 
cleaning or maintenance. Alternate equivalent screening methods may be approved by the city. 
Each refuse facility shall be located so as to facilitate pickup by refuse collection agencies. 
Adequate reinforced paved areas shall be provided for refuse facilities and their approaches for 
loading and unloading, as per illustration 50-115-1. The standards within this section shall apply 
to all new enclosures added to a site, a waste/recycle dumpster or permanent roll-off added to a

"antenna support structure" includes any tower, mast, pole, tripod, box frame, or other structure 
utilized for the purpose of supporting one or more antennae or microwave reflectors. This 
definition specifically includes towers (radio, television, microwave, wireless, etc.), mobile 
antennas, and any type of similar structure that may be temporary. 
    Antenna (commercial) means an antenna or antenna support structure used for the 
purpose of transmission, retransmission, and/or reception of radio, television, electromagnetic, 
or microwave signals primarily for the purpose of operating a business and/or for financial gain 
(e.g., commercial broadcasting, cellular/wireless telecommunications, etc.). A satellite dish 
antenna that exceeds six feet in diameter shall also be considered as a commercial antenna. 
    Antenna (non-commercial/amateur) means an antenna or antenna support structure used 
for the purpose of transmission, retransmission, and/or reception of radio, television, 
electromagnetic, or microwave signals for private or personal use and not for the purpose of 
operating a business and/or for financial gain. A satellite dish antenna not exceeding six feet in 
diameter shall also be considered as a non-commercial antenna. 
    Collocation means the use of a single support structure and/or site by more than one 
communications provider. 
    Communications operations (commercial) means the transmission, retransmission, and/or 
reception of radio, television, electromagnetic, or microwave signals primarily for the purpose of 
operating a business and/or for financial gain.

provisions of these regulations do not require additional yard setbacks or setbacks from 
residential areas or dwellings. 
n. ?Only one amateur antenna/support structure shall be permitted per residential lot, except 
that a maximum of two satellite dishes may be allowed if both units are no larger than one 
meter (39 inches) in diameter (only one allowed if over one meter in diameter). 
o. ?All commercial signs, flags, lights and attachments other than those required for 
emergency identification, communications operations, structural stability, or as required for 
flight visibility by the FAA and/or FCC shall be prohibited on any antenna or antenna 
support structure. However, lights may remain or be placed upon light standards that are 
altered or replaced in order for them to serve as antenna support structures provided that 
said lights are not commercial (i.e., for-profit) in nature, and provided that said lights are 
placed/replaced as the same size, configuration, number of bulbs, degree of luminance, 
etc. as they previously existed prior to support structure modification/replacement. 
p. ?Any publicly owned antennae or antenna support structures are exempt from regulation by 
this chapter (e.g., public safety communications, etc.). 
q. ?Location requirements for commercial antennas. A commercial antenna support structure 
not allowed by right through another provision of this section may be allowed in any zoning 
district by conditional use permit (CUP) provided that it shall be no closer than a distance 
equal to twice the height of the support structure to any residentially zoned lot and/or to

occupants of neighboring residential dwellings, while providing opportunities for the pursuit of home-
based businesses. For the purposes of these regulations, a home occupation is described as an 
occupation that is carried on in a dwelling unit, or in an accessory building to a dwelling unit, by a 
resident of the premises only, which is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the premises for 
residential purposes, and which can be conducted without any significantly adverse impact on the 
surrounding neighborhood.

(6) ?The occupation activity shall not increase vehicular traffic flow beyond what normally occurs 
within a residential district, and shall not require regular and frequent deliveries by large delivery 
trucks or vehicles with a rated capacity in excess of 1½ tons, according to the manufacturer's

(7) ?There shall be no outside storage, including trailers, or outside display related to the home 
occupation use. 
(8) ?No mechanical or electrical equipment shall be employed on the premises other than that 
which is customarily found in a home environment, and that which is customarily associated 
with a hobby or avocation which is conducted solely for pleasure and not for profit or financial 
gain. 
(9) ?The home occupation shall not generate noise, vibration, glare, fumes/odors, heat or electrical 
interference beyond what normally occurs within a residential district. 
(10) ?The occupation shall not require the use of chemicals on the property that are obnoxious or 
hazardous to the welfare of the neighborhood. 
(11) ?The home occupation shall not involve the use of advertising signs or window displays, or any 
other device that calls attention to the business use of the premises through audio and/or visual 
means. 
(12) ?The occupation shall not offer a ready inventory of any commodity for sale on the premises 
(e.g., arts and crafts items, handmade clothing, etc.). 
(13) ?The occupation shall not be harmful or detrimental to the health, welfare and safety of the 
neighborhood, nor shall it interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life, property and 
recreation by residents of the area.
