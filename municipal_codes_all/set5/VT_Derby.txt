ARTICLE 1: ENACTMENT AND INTENT
§ 101 Introduction
Zoning is the division of all land in the community into various appropriate districts. Within these districts the use of the land, the height and size of buildings, and the other aspects of development are regulated. The locations and standards of these districts are based on the desires of the community laid out in the Derby Municipal Plan.
The purpose of zoning is to protect existing development from nearby detrimental development. Residential areas will remain safe places to live and play. Industrial areas will not be hampered by complaints from nearby residences, and those areas that are a mix of residential and commercial development will be regulated so that these uses are compatible.
Derby first adopted the Zoning Bylaw in 1971 and it has periodically been updated since that date. This updated version is a revision of the previous bylaw that will improve its organization, bring it into compliance with current State law and with the new Town Plan, and clarify parts of the bylaw that have been sources of uncertainty.
The Derby Zoning Bylaw has been established to conform to, and be in harmony with, the Vermont Municipal and Regional Planning and Development Act. Any conflicts that are identified between the two documents will defer to VSA Title 24 Chapter 117 as the prevailing authority.
§ 102 Enactment
In accordance with the Vermont Planning and Development Act, VSA 24 Chapter 117, there are hereby established zoning regulations for the Town of Derby which are set forth in the text and map that constitutes these regulations. These regulations shall be known and cited as the “Town of Derby Zoning Bylaws”.
§ 103 Intent
It is the intent of these zoning bylaws to provide for orderly community growth, to protect the public health, safety and general welfare, to preserve the character and appearance of the Town of Derby, to protect scenic, historic, environmental and natural resources of the Town of Derby, and to further the purposes established in the Town of Derby Municipal Development Plan and in VSA Title 24 §4302.
§ 104 Application of Bylaw
The application of this bylaw is subject to VSA Title 24 Chapter 117. Except as hereinafter provided, no “land development”, as defined below, shall commence unless in conformity with this bylaw as herein specified for the district in which such land or structure is located. Any use not permitted by this bylaw shall be deemed prohibited. “Land development” means the division of a parcel into two or more parcels, the construction, reconstruction, conversion, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any building or other structure, or of any mining, excavation or landfill, and any change in the use of any building or other structure, or land or extension of any use of land.

§ 202 Copies of the Zoning Map
Regardless of the existence of other copies of the Zoning Map, which from time to time may be made or published, the official Zoning Map shall be located in the office of the Zoning Administrator and shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of the land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the Town.
§ 203 Interpretation of District Boundaries
203.1 District boundaries along the lines of roads, streams, and transportation rights of way shall be deemed to follow the centerlines. The abandonment of roads shall not affect the location of district boundaries.
203.2 All district boundaries that are formed by natural bodies of water shall be deemed to follow the high water mark.
203.3 If uncertainty exists with respect to the location of any district boundary on the official Zoning Map, the Planning Commission shall determine the location of such boundary.
203.4 The location of the boundary of the Special Flood Hazard Area shall be determined by the Administrative Officer. If the applicant disagrees with the determination made by the Administrative Officer, a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA shall constitute proof.
§ 204 Classification of Lots: Source of Water and Sewer Service
Lot classifications are dependent on the type of wastewater system and potable water supply used on the lot. Dimensional requirements for lots may vary within a zoning district depending on lot classification. The classification is as follows:
Lot Classification Provision for Water and Sewage Disposal
Class 1 Off-site Water AND off-site Sewer
Class 2 Either on-site Water OR on-site Sewer
Class 3 On-site Water AND on-site Sewer
§ 205 Uses
205.1 Uses designated in §206 - 208 and its tables as “permitted uses” are those that may be commenced, enlarged or altered, in such district provided that all applicable provisions of this Zoning Bylaw are met.
205.2 Uses designated in §206 - 208 and its tables as “conditional uses” are those that may be commenced, enlarged or altered, in such district provided that all applicable provision of this Zoning Bylaw are met and provided that conditional use approval is granted by the Development Review Board after public notice and hearing.

25
pedestrian friendly access, lighting that enhances site design while ensuring safety, mitigate the effects of summer sun and winter winds through appropriate walkway and parking lot shade and screening, provide greenspace for runoff control and storage for parking lot and walkway snow removal and to enhance the livability of more intensely developed properties. The Development Review Board has discretionary powers in the implementation of the following subsections and may allow a deferral or phased execution of special conditions imposed under this Section to assure integration of its requirements with adjacent properties, to further Town Plan goals, or to ensure the public health, safety and welfare; in no case shall such a delay exceed three years from the effective date of a granted zoning permit. The Development Review Board may modify the requirements of this Section in those circumstances where literal enforcement may be contrary to the furtherance of the Town Plan or good planning practice. Submitted site plans or those portions thereof that meet all the criteria of the following subsections shall be deemed approvable by the Development Review Board.
212.1 Landscape and Greenspace Requirements. Specific landscaping and screening requirements shall be determined by the Development Review Board during site plan review or during conditional use review. The following are minimum landscaping requirements:
A. For every twenty-five linear feet of street frontage commercial and multi-family landscape plans shall include a minimum of one deciduous tree of a minimum trunk diameter of two and one half to three inches or one coniferous tree of five to six feet in height, four deciduous shrubs two to three gallon pots and two evergreen shrubs two to three gallon pots. The appropriate choice of deciduous or coniferous tree is at the discretion of the Development Review Board.
B. For commercial projects in excess of 40,000 square feet, for every twenty five linear feet of street frontage landscape plans shall include a minimum of two deciduous trees of two and a half to three inches of trunk diameter or two coniferous trees of five to six feet in height, eight deciduous shrubs two to three gallon pots and four evergreen shrubs two to three gallon pots. The appropriate choice of deciduous or coniferous trees is at the discretion of the Development Review Board.
C. For commercial and multi-family site plans front, side and rear yard greenstrips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and shall only be used for landscaping, permitted access drives and permitted road signs. Curbing is highly recommended; however additional landscaping of a scale that would prevent the passage of vehicles through such required greenspace may be substituted at the discretion of the Development Review Board.
D. Where any non-residential land use in a residential district or where a non-residential land use abuts a residential district, a landscaped greenstrip at least fifteen feet in width shall be maintained as a landscaped area. The Development Review Board may require additional landscape screening.
E. Landscape areas for planned unit developments shall be determined by the Development Review Board.
212.2 Lighting Design Requirements. Site plans submitted for review shall include exterior lighting design and specifications. Lighting designs shall strike a balance
Derby Zoning Bylaw – As amended August 10, 2020
26
between the interests of onsite security and safety and off site glare, neighborhood character and traffic safety. Site lighting shall be unobtrusive and shielded to prevent glare and direct lighting downward. Heights for pole mounted lighting shall be scaled appropriately to building height and in no case shall exceed fifty feet in height.
212.3 Pedestrian Walkway Design. Site plans submitted for review shall make appropriate provision for pedestrian access from all public rights of way to and between all public buildings and spaces within the proposed project. Such pedestrian access shall be so designed as to maximize the safety of pedestrians from motor vehicle traffic within the site. Wherever possible, as determined by the Development Review Board, pedestrian walkways shall be integrated with the public walkways and pedestrian walkways associated with adjacent properties. Such pedestrian walkways shall not be less than three feet in width and meet Agency of Transportation design standards. The Development Review Board may require walkways be landscaped to provide shade, screening and site enhancement.
212.4 Access Design. All access drives entering from a paved road or exiting onto a paved road shall have a 25 ft minimum paved apron.
212.5 Building Façade and Design. Site plans submitted for review shall include building elevations. Whenever possible, as determined by the Development Review Board, façade design shall be consistent with the architectural context of:
A. The historical architecture of the Town of Derby,
B. The historical architecture of northern New England generally and northern Vermont specifically, or
C. The immediate neighborhood where a specific architectural continuity can be cited.

ARTICLE 4: GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 401 Required Regulations
In accordance with §4406 of the Act, the following shall apply:
401.1 Existing small lots. Any lot in individual and separate and non-affiliated ownership from surrounding properties in existence on the effective date of any zoning regulation, including an interim zoning regulation, may be developed for the purposes permitted in the district in which it is located, even though not conforming to minimum lot size requirements, if such lot is less than one-eighth acre in area with minimum width or depth dimension of forty feet.
Derby Zoning Bylaw – As amended August 10, 2020
29
A. If such lot subsequently comes under common ownership with one or more contiguous lots, the lot shall be deemed merged with the contiguous lot for purposes of this Section. However, such a lot shall not be deemed merged and may be separately conveyed, if:
1) the lots are conveyed in their preexisting, compliant non-conforming configuration; and
2) on the effective date of any zoning regulations, each lot had been developed with a water supply and wastewater disposal system; and
3) at the time of the transfer, each water supply and wastewater system is functioning in an acceptable manner; and
4) the deeds of conveyance create appropriate easements on both lots for the replacement of one or more wastewater systems in case a wastewater system fails, which means the system functions in a manner:
a) that allows wastewater to be exposed to the open air, pool on the surface of the ground, discharge directly to surface water, or back up into a building or structure unless the approved design of the system specifically requires the system to function in such a manner;
b) so that a potable water supply is contaminated or rendered not potable;
c) that presents a threat to public health; or
d) that presents a serious threat to the environment.
B. If, subsequent to separate conveyance, as authorized under 401.1 A, a wastewater system fails, the owner shall be required to obtain from the secretary of natural resources a wastewater permit as required under the subdivision regulation or a certification that the wastewater system has been modified or replaced, with the result that it no longer constitutes a failed system.
401.2 Required frontage on, or access to, public roads or public waters. No land development may be permitted on lots which do not either have frontage on a public road or public waters or, with the approval of the Planning Commission, access to such a road or waters by a permanent easement or right-of-way at least twenty feet in width.
401.3 Protection of home occupation. No regulation may infringe upon the right of any resident to use a minor portion of a dwelling for an occupation which is customary in residential areas and which does not change the character thereof. Any application meeting the requirements of §402.3(A) of this Bylaw shall be issued an administrative permit by the Administrative Officer for that purpose.
401.4 Equal treatment of housing.
A. Except as provided in §4414(1)(E) and (F) of the Act, no zoning regulation shall have the effect of excluding mobile homes, modular housing, or other forms of prefabricated housing from the Town of Derby, except on the same terms and conditions as conventional housing is excluded.
B. No zoning regulation shall have the effect of excluding from the Town of Derby housing to meet the needs of the population as determined in §4382(c) of the Act.
C. No provision of this Bylaw shall be construed to prevent the establishment of mobile home parks pursuant to VSA T.10 chapter 153.
Derby Zoning Bylaw – As amended August 10, 2020
30

a) The property has sufficient wastewater capacity; and
b) The unit does not exceed 30 percent of the total habitable floor area of the single-family dwelling; and
c) Applicable setback, coverage, and parking requirements specified in the bylaws are met.

The distance shall be measured in a straight line from the closest property line of any listed use, parcel or zoning area, and to the closest exterior wall of the proposed Adult Oriented Business.
409.2 Screening. All building openings, entries and windows of Adult Oriented Business Establishments shall be located, covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any public or semi-public area, including public sidewalks, streets, arcades, hallways, or passageways of any material which has as its primary theme matter depicting, illustrating, or describing, Specified Anatomical Areas or Specified Sexual Activities.
409.3 Signs. No sign visible from the exterior of an Adult Oriented Business shall include any image, depiction or linguistic reference to Nudity, Specified Anatomical Areas, or Specified Sexual Activities.

The setback requirements may be reduced a maximum of 20% below the original requirement.
A waiver request shall be made at the time of application for a conditional use permit. In granting such waiver, the Planning Commission may require additional site mitigation through design and screening requirements as a condition of approval. The request for waiver shall state the reasons why strict compliance with the zoning bylaw setback requirements would result in an excessive burden on communication, and shall propose avenues for lessening that burden through the permitting process.

§ 704 Planned Residential Developments
The purpose of planned residential developments (PRD) is to enable and encourage flexibility of design and development in such a manner as to promote the most appropriate use of land, economic provision of streets and utilities, and preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open lands by encouraging cluster residential development.
704.1 Procedure for submission and review of PRD proposals shall be that of any other subdivision proposal moving through Planning Commission public hearings for conceptual and final approval. The applicant shall submit a scaled site plan showing
Derby Zoning Bylaw – As amended August 10, 2020
61
the location, height and spacing of buildings, open spaces and their landscaping, streets, driveways and off-street parking spaces and all other physical features, accompanied by a statement setting forth the nature of all proposed modifications, changes or supplementations of existing zoning regulations.
704.2 The permitted number of dwelling units may include a density increase of up to twenty-five percent above what would be allowed under the Bylaw for the zoning district, or fifty percent in the case of an affordable housing development as defined by the Vermont Department of Housing, provided that the Planning Commission determines that site conditions can support such an increase in density, and that the character of the neighborhood and planned or existing community facilities will not be adversely affected by the density increase. No applicant under the PRD provisions of this Bylaw shall be required to apply for or accept a density increase.
704.3 The dwelling units permitted may, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, be of varied types including one-family, two-family, multi-family semi-detached or multi-family construction.
704.4 If the application of this procedure results in lands available for park, recreation, open space, community septic tanks and leach fields or other municipal purposes, the Planning Commission as a condition of approval may establish such conditions on the ownership, use and maintenance of such lands as is deemed necessary to assure the preservation of such lands for their intended purposes.
704.5 Any modification of the Zoning Bylaw approved under this §shall be specifically set forth in terms of standards and criteria for the design, bulk and spacing of buildings and the sizes of lots and open spaces which shall be required, and these shall be noted or appended to the plat.
§ 705 Planned Unit Developments
The purpose of planned unit developments (PUD)s is to enable and encourage flexibility in design and development that combines complementary uses which will result in; a choice in the types of environments and living units available to the public and quality in land uses so that development will be a permanent and long term asset to the town, create open space and recreation areas where dwelling units are part of the development, encourage a pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural topography and prevents soil erosion, and causes an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets. The ultimate goal of permitting PUD development is to avoid strip type commercial development and to provide a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of other sections of these regulations. These regulations for PUDs shall not be construed as an exemption of permitted or conditional use requirements for the zoning district that the proposed PUD is located in.
705.1 Procedure for submission and review of PUD proposals shall be that of any other subdivision proposal moving through Planning Commission public hearings for conceptual and final approval. The applicant shall submit a scaled site plan showing the locations, heights and spacing of all existing and planned buildings and structures, parking areas, contours and all other physical features, roads, site work
Derby Zoning Bylaw – As amended August 10, 2020
62
and landscaping, and all utilities shall also be shown and described. In addition the site plans shall show adjacent building outlines and other outstanding features within 200 feet. The Planning Commission may require the submission of typical elevations and floor plans of all buildings.
705.2 The Planning Commission may allow greater densities or intensity of residential uses within some section or sections of the development than others. The Planning Commission may require that this greater density be offset by lesser densities in other sections of the PUD.
705.3 In a PUD dwelling units may be multi-family, the permitted number of dwelling units may include a density increase of fifty percent above what would be allowed under the Bylaw for the zoning district in the case of an affordable housing development provided that the Planning Commission determines that site conditions can support such an increase in density, and that the character of the neighborhood and planned or existing community facilities will not be adversely affected by the density increase. In a PUD in a residential district, commercial, educational, and public facilities may be allowed which are designed to serve the PUD and the area around the PUD.
705.4 Lot size, width, front yard and side yard setback requirements may be altered; however, these alterations shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission on their individual merit.
705.5 A PUD shall comply with the following standards:
A. The minimum lot area for a PUD shall be five acres or the minimum lot area for the zoning district, whichever is greater.
B. Off lot water and sewer may be required if over six residential units are proposed.
C. At least twenty-five percent of the PUD should be in open space and or common usage, the Planning Commission as a condition of approval may establish such conditions on the ownership, use and maintenance of such areas as is deemed necessary to assure the preservation of such areas for their intended uses. This may be waived by the Planning Commission for commercial and industrial PUDs provided adequate screening and landscaping are proposed.
D. Any and all of the conditions required for conditional uses as set forth in §208 of the Bylaw may be required by the Planning Commission for a PUD.
§ 706 Supplemental Rules and Regulations for PRD and PUD
The Planning Commission may prescribe, from time to time, rules and regulations to supplement the standards and conditions set forth in this Zoning Bylaw for PRDs and PUDs, provided the rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the Town Plan. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing after public notice as required by Section 4447 of the Act prior to the establishment of any supplemental rules and regulations for PRDs and PUDs.
§ 707 Mobile Home Parks
