A. The purpose of shared leave is to permit city employees, at no additional cost to the city, other than the administrative costs of administering the program, to come to the aid of a fellow city employee who is suffering from or has an immediate family member suffering from an extraordinary, severe or extended illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition, or for maternity purposes, which condition has caused or is likely to cause the employee to take leave without pay or to terminate his or her employment.

B. The mayor may permit an employee to receive shared leave under this section if:

1. The employee needs to take maternity leave or suffers, or has an immediate family member suffering from, an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition which is of an extraordinary, severe or extended nature, and which maternity leave or other condition has caused, or is likely to cause, the employee to go on leave without pay status or to terminate his or her employment with the city; and

2. The employee has depleted or will shortly deplete his or her total of accrued vacation, sick leave, compensatory time, holiday time, and/or other paid leave; and

3. Prior to the use of shared leave, the employee has abided by the city’s sick leave policy; and

4. If applicable, the employee has diligently pursued and is found to be ineligible for state industrial insurance benefits; and

5. The use of shared leave will not significantly increase the city’s costs, except for those costs which would otherwise be incurred in the administration of this program or which would otherwise be incurred by the employee’s department.

C. The mayor will determine the amount of shared leave, if any, which an employee may receive under this shared leave program. The employee may be required, at the city’s discretion, to provide appropriate medical or other justification and documentation for the necessity for the leave and the time which the employee can reasonably be expected to be absent from work. An employee shall not receive more than 500 hours annually of shared leave. To the extent possible, shared leave shall be used on a consecutive day basis.

D. Employees may request the mayor to approve the transfer of a specified amount of accrued sick leave to an employee who is authorized to receive shared leave as provided herein.

1. To be eligible to donate sick leave, an employee must have a total of more than 100 hours of accrued sick leave available for the employee’s own use.

2. Employees with less than 100 hours of accrued sick leave or whose proposed donation would result in the employee having less than 100 hours of accrued sick leave may not donate any of the employee’s accrued sick leave to this shared leave program.

3. In no event shall a transfer of leave be approved which would result in an employee reducing his or her total accrued sick leave to less than 100 hours.

4. Transfers of an employee’s accrued sick leave shall be in four-hour increments.

E. All donations of accrued sick leave shall be voluntary. The city shall not transfer sick leave from one employee to another employee in excess of the amount specified in the request.

F. While an employee is on shared leave, he or she will continue to be classified as a city employee and shall receive the same treatment, in respect to wage and benefits, as the employee would otherwise receive if using his/her own accrued sick leave.

1. All wage and benefit payments made to the employee on shared leave shall be made by the department employing the person using the shared leave.

2. The employee’s wage rate shall not change as a result of being on shared leave nor, under any circumstances, shall the total of the employee’s wage and other benefits including, but not limited to, state industrial insurance or any other benefits received as a result of payments by the city to an insurer, health care provider, or pension system, exceed the total of wage and benefits which the employee would have received had he or she been in a regular pay status.

G. The city treasurer shall be responsible for adjusting the accrued sick leave balances to show the transferred leave. The city treasurer shall maintain all records of all leave time transferred in the event any unused time is returned at a later date.

H. The mayor shall determine when shared leave is no longer needed. To the extent administratively feasible, unused sick leave may be returned to the donor employees on a pro rata basis.

I. The mayor shall monitor the use of shared leave to ensure consistent and nondiscriminatory treatment for all employees of the city. Inappropriate use or treatment of the shared leave program may result in the cancellation of the donated leave or use of shared leave.

J. The city, in its sole discretion, may cancel this program; provided, however, if the city decides to terminate this program, the city will provide any affected bargaining unit with 30 calendar days’ notice of the city’s intent to terminate the program.

4.46.010 Policy.

The city invests public funds in a manner that conforms to all Washington statutes governing the investment of public funds, safeguards and protects the principal of the city’s investments, provides liquidity in meeting cash flow requirements, and provides the highest return possible. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.020 Investment objectives.

A. In priority order, the city’s investment objectives are:

1. Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the city’s investment policy. The city must invest in a manner that ensures the preservation of the amount invested.

2. Liquidity. The city’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all reasonably anticipated operating requirements.

3. Return on investment. To ensure protection of principal and compliance with state statutes, the city will design its investment portfolio with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles.

B. Rate speculation may not be a major criterion for the selection of an investment. All other criteria, including cash flow and maturity, take preference to rate expectations. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.030 Scope.

This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the city. These assets are accounted for in funds or fund groups as identified in the city’s comprehensive annual financial report and include:

A. General fund.

B. Special revenue funds.

C. Debt service funds.

D. Capital project funds.

E. Internal services funds.

F. Trust and agency funds.

G. Any new fund created by council, unless specifically exempted by council. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.040 Prudence.

A. The city’s investment official must invest city funds in such manner as to maximize the yield of the investment portfolio. In investing and reinvesting moneys and in acquiring, retaining, managing, and disposing of investments, he or she must exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing which a person of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercises in the management of his or her own affairs, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of the funds considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of the capital.

B. The standard of prudence that the city’s investment official must use is the prudent-person standard. This standard must be applied in managing the city’s overall portfolio. If an investment officer acts under written procedures and exercises due diligence, he or she is relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are timely reported and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.050 Delegation of authority.

The finance director is the investment officer of the city. Before investing any of the city’s money, the investment officer must establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. These procedures must include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under this policy and the procedures established by the investment officer. The investment officer is responsible for all transactions undertaken and must establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. The investment officer may determine investable balances in each fund and may invest such moneys in a manner consistent with this policy and applicable law, without prior council approval of an investment. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.060 Investment committee.

The city’s budget committee acts as the investment committee. The committee will be available to serve in a general review and advisory capacity, taking into account the city’s investment objectives, available funds and current market conditions. The committee will review periodic reports including, but not limited to: market value of the portfolio, percentages by type and institution, average life of the portfolio, expected cash flows, and average rate of return. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.070 Ethics and conflicts of interest.

An elected official or an employee involved in the investment process must refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program or that could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. An elected official or an employee involved in investment transactions must disclose to the mayor any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within this jurisdiction. He or she must further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the city’s portfolio. Each elected official and each employee must subordinate his or her personal investment transactions to those of the city, particularly regarding the time of purchases and sales. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.080 Authorized financial dealers and institutions.

A. The council authorizes the investment officer to create any accounts necessary to invest the city’s funds. The investment officer will maintain a list of financial institutions and security dealers authorized to provide investment services to the city. These may include both primary and secondary dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-I (uniform net capital rule) (as enacted and as amended), and investment departments of local banks who maintain an office in the state of Washington.

B. Institutional investment staff will be trained in precautions appropriate to state of Washington local government investment laws, and they will be required to familiarize themselves with the city’s investment objectives, policies and constraints.

C. A public deposit must be made in a qualified public depository located in the state of Washington. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.090 Authorized investment types.

A. As authorized by state statute (including, without limitation, RCW 39.59.020, 39.59.030, and 43.250.040 (as enacted and as amended)), the city may invest in various securities, including, without limitation, the following:

1. Investment deposits: certificates of deposit (with qualified public depositories as defined in Chapter 39.58 RCW).

2. Obligations of United States Treasury: U.S. Treasury certificates, notes, bonds, zero coupons, strips, receipts and United States Treasury state and local government securities (SLGS) specifically for debt issues related to arbitrage.

3. Obligations of United States agencies, or of any corporation wholly owned by the government of the United States, such as the Government National Mortgage Association.

4. Bonds of the state of Washington and any local government in the state of Washington, which bonds are rated, at the time of investment, within the three highest possible credit ratings of a nationally recognized rating agency.

5. General obligation bonds of a state other than the state of Washington and general obligation bonds of a local government of a state other than the state of Washington, which bonds are rated, at the time of investment, within the three highest credit ratings of a nationally recognized rating agency.

6. Utility revenue bonds or warrants of any city or town in the state of Washington.

7. Bonds or warrants of a local improvement district within the protection of the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund Law.

8. Banker’s acceptances purchased on the secondary market, with ratings of A1/P1.

9. State of Washington Local Government Investment Pool.

B. The city will buy no structured securities, including those whose rates of return are derivative-based, except for securities that have a call provision prior to maturity or those securities that have their rate of return based on a direct relationship with the federal funds rate or Treasury bill rate. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.100 Fund investment and interest allocations.

Investments must be made with excess funds and the interest earnings will be distributed. Moneys determined by the investment officer to be available for investment may be invested on an individual fund basis or may, unless otherwise restricted by law, be commingled within one common fund called the treasury account. All income derived from treasury account investments shall be deposited to the funds contributing to the common fund on a pro rata basis. Also, funds derived from the sale of general obligation bonds or revenue bonds or similar instruments of indebtedness shall be invested or used in the manner prescribed by the initiating ordinances, resolutions, or bond covenants. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.110 Safekeeping and custody.

All security transactions entered into by the city must be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Each security must be registered in the name of the city. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.120 Diversification.

To reduce overall portfolio risks while attaining market average rates of return, the city must diversify its investments. The city must diversify by institution, by type of investment security, and by years to maturity. Such diversification avoids overconcentration in any of these areas. Except for obligations of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, and for funds in the State of Washington Local Government Investment Pool, no more than 25 percent of the city’s total investment portfolio may be invested in securities offered by a single issuer. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.130 Maturities.

A. To the extent possible, unless matched to a specific cash flow, the city will attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the city will maintain a portfolio with an average life not to exceed five years. However, small amounts of general funds are exempt from this five-year rule based on prior investment portfolio history.

B. The city may sell securities, if deemed appropriate, to maintain liquidity. These actions must be initiated by the investment officer, not by a broker or by a dealer.

C. No transaction needs to be instituted when the maturity or call of a security causes the average life of the portfolio or maximum holdings per category to exceed their limits. Any transactions conducted after these occurrences shall work toward a return to compliance. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.140 Internal control.

The State Auditor’s Office will annually perform an established process of independent review. This review will provide internal control by assuring compliance with policies and procedures. This review may also result in recommendations to change operating procedures to improve internal control. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.150 Performance standards.

Because the city’s investment strategy is passive, the city’s investment portfolio will be designed to obtain a market average rate of return equal to or greater than that obtained by the State of Washington Local Government Investment Pool. The portfolio rate of return will be calculated excluding U.S. Treasury SLGS, which have restricted yields due to arbitrage requirements. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.160 Reporting.

The investment officer will submit monthly investment reports that summarize the portfolio’s holdings and investments by type to the city investment committee. On a quarterly basis, the investment officer must submit investment reports that summarize the portfolio’s average rate of return, market value and average maturity to the city council. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)


4.46.170 State or federal amendments.

This policy immediately incorporates any new legislation or new regulation that amends permitted instruments or permitted institutions. (Ord. 15-05 § 6, 2015)

2. This section sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the city, and establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimis business activities in the city without having to pay a business license fee. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection (D)(1) of this section. If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the city shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and applicable law.

3. Without being all-inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf, constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:

6. The city expressly intends that engaging in business include any activity sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the license fee under the law and the Constitutions of the United States and the state of Washington.

B. If a person operates a business at multiple locations within the city, each business location must be licensed separately.

C. A change of business location within the city requires review and approval by the city of the new location, and may require reapplication for the appropriate licenses to operate at the new location.

D. A city business license is not transferable. A change in ownership of a business requires the new owner to make application for a separate license. (Ord. 17-13 § 6, 2017)


5.04.030 Liability for damages.

The city recognizes that it cannot solve all problems relating to businesses licensed under this chapter through legislation. Thus, this chapter is an effort to make the best possible use of available resources. This chapter is not an attempt to provide complete protection to all of the city’s inhabitants.

A. This chapter expressly provides for and promotes the health, safety and welfare of the general public. It does not create or designate any particular class of persons who will or should be especially protected by its terms.

B. This chapter specifically intends to place the obligation of complying with its terms on the licensee. No provision of this chapter imposes a duty upon the city, for whom the implementation or enforcement of this chapter is discretionary and not mandatory.

C. Nothing in this chapter creates the basis for any liability on the part of the city for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a licensee to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or by reason or in consequence of any act or omission in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter on the part of the city.

D. By issuing a business license to a licensee, the city does not create a duty of the city to indemnify a business licensee for a wrongful act against the public, to guarantee the quality of goods, services, or expertise of a licensee, or to otherwise shift responsibility from the licensee to the city for proper training or for proper conduct of a licensee. (Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015)


5.04.040 Person subject to tax.

The city levies upon and will collect from each person engaging in business in the city an annual license fee for the privilege of engaging in business activities within the city limits. (Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 99-12 § 1, 1999; Ord. 305 § 3, 1980. Formerly 5.04.030)


5.04.050 Business located outside city limits.

Unless otherwise exempt, all requirements of this chapter cover and apply to any business located outside the city that engages in some business activity inside the city limits, except that only employees working within the city limits are to be counted. (Ord. 17-13 § 5, 2017; Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 99-12 § 1, 1999; Ord. 305 § 4, 1980. Formerly 5.04.040)

D. A person or organization conducting a nonprofit enterprise when the enterprise is operated without private profit, for a public, charitable, educational, literary, fraternal or religious purpose, is exempt only from the city license fee required by this chapter, but must comply with the business licensing requirement as outlined in EWMC 5.04.120;

E. A person under the age of 18 engaged in babysitting;

F. A person selling his or her own produce;

G. A person that the city is forbidden to tax by law;

H. A person engaged in the casual sale of items of personal property where the person conducting such sale is not regularly engaged in the business of selling items of personal property (for example, garage sales and bake sales);

I. A landlord; and

J. A person or business whose annual value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business in the city is equal to or less than $2,000 and who does not maintain a place of business within the city. However, a person or business who qualifies for this exemption must still submit a business license registration to the director or designee. The fee for this submission is $0.00. The threshold does not apply to regulatory license requirements or activities that require a specialized permit. (Ord. 18-09 § 6, 2018; Ord. 17-13 § 5, 2017; Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 99-12 § 1, 1999; Ord. 305 § 5, 1980. Formerly 5.04.050)


5.04.070 Applicability of other ordinances.

A person exempted from obtaining a business license must comply with any other ordinances of the city relating to taxes, fees or licenses, particularly, although not so limited thereto, gambling or any other tax or license fee required to be purchased or paid for carrying on that particular activity. (Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 99-12 § 1, 1999; Ord. 305 § 6, 1980. Formerly 5.04.060)


5.04.080 Basic license fee.

A. Unless it is otherwise provided by provision in a section providing for the licensing of a special, named, enumerated or specific business or activity, the annual basic license fee is assessed according to the number of persons employed, whether full time or part time and including business owners, at the time a business applies for or renews a license. This license fee is a basic fee for doing and conducting business within the city limits. Any other section of this chapter or any ordinance of the city requiring a license or tax for conducting a specific and named activity is in addition to this basic license fee. There is no set-off or credit given for this basic license fee unless such ordinance or section of ordinance so allows. The basic license fee rates are as follows:

	Number of Persons Employed	 

	0 – 2	$50

	3 – 5	$70

	6 – 12	$110

	13 – 25	$155

	26 – 50	$260

	51 and over	$400

B. Beginning January 1, 2018, on January 1st of each year, the city will increase the basic license fee by 100 percent of the U.S. Consumer Price Index of Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) July to July statistics for the West Urban Region for the preceding 12 months, rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.

C. An applicant must pay the fee for a business license in full at the time the application is submitted, and annually thereafter on or before its expiration date. (Ord. 18-15 § 1, 2018; Ord. 17-13 § 5, 2017; Ord. 15-17 § 4, 2015; Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 99-12 § 1, 1999; Ord. 305 § 7, 1980. Formerly 5.04.070)


5.04.090 Term.

A business license issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter expires on the date determined by the Business Licensing Service (“BLS”), and must be renewed by that expiration date in order to continue in business within the city. Renewal of a license is accomplished through BLS and must include all fees due for the licenses held as well as the handling fee authorized by RCW 19.02.075. The city license term and expiration date will be coordinated with the expiration date established for a business by BLS and the license term and fees may be prorated to synchronize with the BLS expiration. License renewals are administered by BLS in cooperation with the city. If a business indicates a change in ownership, or character of business, a new application must be submitted and all respective fees paid. A change of physical location within the city must be reviewed and approved by the city and may also require submitting a new application and payment of all fees due for licensure at the new location. (Ord. 17-13 § 5, 2017; Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015)


5.04.100 Failure to pay – Penalty.

A. Failure to complete a renewal on or before the expiration date incurs a late renewal penalty authorized by RCW 19.02.085. Failure to renew the license within 120 days after the license expiration date will result in the cancellation of the license and require reapplication and payment of all fees due in order to continue business within the city.

B. The city may also impose the penalties set forth in EWMC 5.04.160. (Ord. 17-13 § 5, 2017; Ord. 15-13 § 4, 2015; Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 99-12 § 1, 1999; Ord. 305 § 8, 1980. Formerly 5.04.080)


5.04.110 License constitutes debt to city.

A license fee due or unpaid under this chapter, and all city-assessed penalties thereon, constitutes a debt to the city, and may be collected by court proceeding in the same manner as any other debt in like amount. This remedy is in addition to all other existing remedies. (Ord. 17-13 § 5, 2017; Ord. 15-04 § 5 (Exh. A), 2015)


5.04.120 Review of nonprofit exempt organization business.

D. Decision of the Court.

1. The court shall determine whether the city has established by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred and that the required correction is reasonable under the circumstances, and shall affirm, vacate, or modify the city’s decisions regarding the alleged violation and/or the required corrective action, with or without written conditions.

iii. Whether the violation was a repeat violation;

iv. Whether the person showed due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting the violation; and

v. Any other relevant factors.

c. The court may double the monetary penalty schedule if the nuisance violation is a repeat violation. In determining the amount of the monetary penalty for repeat violations the court shall consider the factors set forth in subsection (D)(3)(b) of this section.

The city may enforce the court’s order and recover all related expenses, including attorney fees, costs of the hearing and any monetary penalty from that person.

F. Appeal to Superior Court. Any appeal of the decision of the court shall be pursuant to the then-current Rules for Appeal from Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (RALJ).

A. Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.

B. It is appropriate to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving application of graffiti to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed. Unfortunately, obtaining convictions for such acts is difficult because the offenses involved can be committed quickly and secretively so that witnesses to the acts are frequently non-existent.

C. Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to the proper authorities, it is also important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the property on which the graffiti is located and the surrounding properties do not suffer diminution of value. (Ord. 97-8 § 1, 1997)


9.38.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:

A. “Graffiti” means the defacement of public or private property (including any property of the city) by painting, spray painting, or defacing property through the inscription of symbols, words, or pictures onto said private or public property.

B. “Graffiti abatement procedure” means the abatement procedure which identifies graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in absence of response.

C. “Private contractor” means any person with whom the city shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti. (Ord. 97-8 § 1, 1997)


9.38.030 Graffiti prohibited.

A. Except as provided below, it shall be unlawful for any person to write, paint or draw upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, or other structure, tree or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and defined as “graffiti” within the city.

B. It shall not be unlawful if the person responsible for the graffiti is the owner or has control or custody of the property, or has prior consent of the owner or tenant in lawful possession of such private property, or the act is done under the personal direction of said owner or tenant; provided such graffiti will not be in violation of any other state or local laws, rules, or regulations. (Ord. 97-8 § 1, 1997)


9.38.040 Graffiti – Notice of removal.

A. Whenever the police chief of the city of East Wenatchee or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti exists on any public or private building, structure, and place which is visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right-of-way within the city, the police chief shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. Except as provided below, the property owner shall have 15 days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or consent to the removal by the city for a fee equal to the actual cost of removing the graffiti on a time and material basis or $50.00, whichever is greater; otherwise the graffiti will be subject to abatement by the city, and all abatement costs thereof shall be the responsibility of the property owner. When seasonal conditions would reasonably limit or restrict efforts to abate the nuisance, the police chief shall designate a date before which the graffiti shall be abated. In no event shall the time designated by the police chief to abate the graffiti be less than 15 days or more than 60 days.

B. The written notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owners’ name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of Douglas County, Washington. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners:

1. By personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or control of the property;

2. By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address.

C. The notice shall be substantially in the following form:

Notice of Intent to Remove Graffiti

Date:

To:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required, by Ordinance of the City of East Wenatchee, at your own expense, to remove or paint over the graffiti located on the property commonly known as [address], East Wenatchee, Washington, which is visible to public view, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this notice [when applicable, insert specific date]; or, if you fail to do so, the City may abate the nuisance by removing or painting over the graffiti. You will be responsible for all abatement costs incurred by the City to remove the graffiti.

As an alternative to removing the graffiti, if you consent to the entry upon your property within the time frame set forth above, the City will undertake removal of the graffiti upon payment to the City of an amount equal to the actual cost of removing the graffiti on a time and material basis or $50, whichever is greater.

9.38.060 Appeal procedure.

The East Wenatchee municipal court clerk, upon receipt of a notice of appeal, shall set a hearing date not less than 30 days from receipt of the notice of appeal, at which time the appellant may appear and present evidence seeking relief from the notice of removal. The police chief, or his/her designated representative, may likewise present evidence at such appeal hearing. Following the hearing, the East Wenatchee municipal court judge shall render a written decision within 10 days. (Ord. 97-8 § 1, 1997)


9.38.070 Removal by city.

Upon failure to remove the graffiti or consent to the removal by the city by date set forth in the notice of intent to remove graffiti, or such continued date thereafter as the police chief approves, then the police chief is authorized and directed to cause the graffiti to be abated by city forces or by private contract, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the premises for such purposes. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city, and any paint used to obliterate to recover graffiti shall be as close as practicable to background color(s). If the police chief provides for the removal of tile graffiti, he/she shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located.

The officer or his Department shall make a reasonable effort to contact the owner by telephone in order to give the owner the information on the notification sticker.

3. If the vehicle is not removed within 24 hours from the time the notification sticker is attached, the law enforcement officer may take custody of the vehicle and provide for the vehicle’s removal to a place of safety. A vehicle that does not pose a safety hazard may remain on the roadside for more than 24 hours if the owner or operator is unable to remove it from the place where it is located and so notifies law enforcement officials and requests assistance.

4. For the purposes of this section, a place of safety includes the business location of a registered tow truck operator.

D. Storage.

1. All vehicles impounded shall be taken to the nearest storage location that has been inspected and is listed on the application filed with the Department.

2. All vehicles shall be handled and returned in substantially the same condition as they existed before being towed.

3. All personal belongings and contents in the vehicle, with the exception of those items of personal property that are registered or titled with the Department, shall be kept intact, and shall be returned to the vehicle’s owner or agent during normal business hours upon request and presentation of a driver’s license or other sufficient identification. Personal belongings, with the exception of those items of personal property that are registered or titled with the Department, shall not be sold at auction to fulfill a lien against the vehicle.

4. All personal belongings, with the exception of those items of personal property that are registered or titled with the Department, not claimed before the auction shall be turned over to the East Wenatchee police department. Such personal belongings shall be disposed of pursuant to Chapter 63.32 or 63.40 RCW.

5. Tow truck drivers shall have a Washington State driver’s license endorsed for the appropriate classification under Chapter 46.25 RCW or the equivalent issued by another state.

6. Any person who shows proof of ownership or written authorization from the impounded vehicle’s registered or legal owner or the vehicle’s insurer may view the vehicle without charge during normal business hours.

E. Impound Notice – Abandoned Vehicle Report – Owner Information – Disposition – Report.

1. At the time of impoundment, the registered tow truck operator providing the towing service shall give immediate notification, by telephone or radio, to the East Wenatchee police department who shall maintain a log of such reports. The East Wenatchee police department, or a private communication center acting on behalf of the East Wenatchee police department, shall, within six to 12 hours of the impoundment, provide to a requesting operator the name and address of the legal and registered owners of the vehicle, and the registered owner of any personal property registered or titled with the Department that is attached to or contained in or on the impounded vehicle, the vehicle identification number, and any necessary, pertinent information. The initial notice of impoundment shall be followed by a written or electronic facsimile notice within 24 hours. In the case of a vehicle from another state, time requirements of this subsection do not apply until the East Wenatchee police department receives the information.

2. The tow truck operator shall immediately send an abandoned vehicle report to the Department for any vehicle, and for any items of personal property registered or titled with the Department, that are in the operator’s possession after the 120-hour abandonment period. Such report need not be sent when the impoundment is pursuant to a writ, court order, or police hold. The owner notification and abandonment process shall be initiated by the registered tow truck operator immediately following notification by a court or law enforcement officer that the writ, court order, or police hold is no longer in effect.

3. Following the submittal of an abandoned vehicle report, the Department shall provide the registered tow truck operator with owner information within 72 hours.

4. Within 14 days of the sale of an abandoned vehicle at public auction, the towing operator shall send a copy of the abandoned vehicle report showing the disposition of the abandoned vehicle and any other items of personal property registered or titled with the Department to the Crime Information Center and the Washington State Patrol.

5. If the operator sends an abandoned vehicle report to the Department and the Department finds no owner information, an operator may proceed with an inspection of the vehicle and any other items of personal property registered or titled with the Department to determine whether owner identification is within the vehicle.

6. If the operator finds no owner identification, the operator shall immediately notify the appropriate law enforcement agency, which shall search the vehicle and any other items of personal property registered or titled with the Department for the vehicle identification number or other appropriate identification numbers and check the necessary records to determine the vehicle’s or other property’s owners.

F. Responsibility of Registered Owner.

1. The abandonment of any vehicle creates a prima facie presumption that the last registered owner of record is responsible for the abandonment and is liable for costs incurred in removing, storing, and disposing of the abandoned vehicle, less amounts realized at auction.

2. If an unauthorized vehicle is found abandoned under subsection (F)(1) of this section and removed at the direction of law enforcement, the last registered owner of record is guilty of a traffic infraction, unless the vehicle is redeemed as provided in RCW 46.55.120. In addition to any other monetary penalty payable under Chapter 46.63 RCW, the court shall not consider all monetary penalties as having been paid until the court is satisfied that the person found to have committed the infraction has made restitution in the amount of the deficiency remaining after disposal of the vehicle under RCW 46.55.140.

3. A vehicle theft report filed with a law enforcement agency relieves the last registered owner of liability under subsection (F)(2) of this section for failure to redeem the vehicle. However, the last registered owner remains liable for the costs incurred in removing, storing, and disposing of the abandoned vehicle under subsection (F)(1) of this section. Nothing in this section limits in any way the registered owner’s rights in a civil action or as restitution in a criminal action against a person responsible for the theft of the vehicle.

4. Properly filing a report of sale or transfer regarding the vehicle involved in accordance with RCW 46.12.101(1) relieves the last registered owner of liability under subsections (F)(1) and (2) of this section. If the date of sale as indicated on the report of sale is on or before the date of impoundment, the buyer identified on the latest properly filed report of sale with the Department is assumed liable for the costs incurred in removing, storing and disposing of the abandoned vehicle, less amounts realized at auction. If the date of the sale is after the date of impoundment, the previous registered owner is assumed to be liable for such costs. A licensed vehicle dealer is not liable under subsections (F)(1) and (2) of this section if the dealer, as transferee or assignee of the last registered owner of the vehicle involved, has complied with the requirements of RCW 46.70.122 upon selling or otherwise disposing of the vehicle, or if the dealer has timely filed a transitional ownership record or report of sale under RCW 46.12.103. In that case, the person to whom the licensed vehicle dealer has sold or transferred the vehicle is assumed liable for the costs incurred in removing, storing, and disposing of the abandoned vehicle, less amounts realized at auction.

5. For the purposes of reporting notices of traffic infraction to the Department under RCW 46.20.270 and 46.52.100, and for purposes of reporting notices of failure to appear, respond, or comply regarding a notice of traffic infraction to the Department under RCW 46.63.070(5), a traffic infraction under subsection (F)(2) of this section is not considered to be a standing, stopping, or parking violation.

6. A notice of infraction for a violation of this section may be filed with the East Wenatchee municipal court.

G. Notice to Legal and Registered Owners.

1. When an unauthorized vehicle is impounded, the impounding towing operator shall notify the legal and registered owners of the impoundment of the unauthorized vehicle and the owners of any other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department. The notification shall be sent by first-class mail within 24 hours after the impoundment to the last known registered and legal owners of the vehicle, and the owners of any other items of personal property registered or titled with the Department, as provided by the law enforcement agency, and shall inform the owners of the identity of the person or agency authorizing the impoundment. The notification shall include the name of the impounding tow firm, its address and telephone number. The notification shall also include the location, time of the impoundment, and by whose authority the vehicle was impounded. The notification shall also include the written notice of the right of redemption and the opportunity for a hearing to contest the validity of the impoundment pursuant to RCW 46.55.120.

2. In the case of an abandoned vehicle, or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department, within 24 hours after receiving information on the owners from the Department through the abandoned vehicle report, the tow truck operator shall send by certified mail, with return receipt requested, a notice of custody and sale to the legal and registered owners.

3. If the date on which a notice required by subsection (G)(2) of this section is to be mailed falls upon a Saturday, Sunday or a postal holiday, the notice may be mailed on the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday nor a postal holiday.

4. No notices need to be sent to the legal and registered owners of an impounded vehicle or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department, if the vehicle or personal property has been redeemed.

H. Removal by Police Officer.

1. Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 or of RCW 46.20.342 or 46.20.420, the vehicle is subject to impoundment, pursuant to applicable local ordinance at the direction of a law enforcement officer. In addition, a police officer may take custody of a vehicle and provide for its prompt removal to a place of safety under any of the following circumstances:

a. Whenever a police officer finds a vehicle standing upon a roadway in violation of any of the provisions of RCW 46.61.560, the officer may provide for the removal of the vehicle or require the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the vehicle to a position off the roadway;

b. Whenever a police officer finds a vehicle unattended upon a highway where the vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic or jeopardizes public safety;

c. Whenever a police officer finds an unattended vehicle at the scene of an accident or when the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident is physically or mentally incapable of deciding upon steps to be taken to protect his or her property;

d. Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested and taken into custody by a police officer;

e. Whenever a police officer discovers a vehicle that the officer determines to be a stolen vehicle;

f. Whenever a vehicle without a special license plate, card, or decal indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport a disabled person under RCW 46.61.581 which space is provided on private property without charge or on public property;

g. Upon determining that a person is operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver’s license in violation of RCW 46.20.005 or with a license that has been expired for 90 days or more.

2. Nothing in this section may derogate from the powers of police officers under the common law. For purposes of this section, a place of safety may include the business location of a registered tow truck operator. (Ord. 99-9 § 1, 1999)


10.20.030 Redemption rights and hearing procedures.

A. Redemption Requirements.

1. Vehicles or other items of personal property registered or titled with the Department that are impounded by registered tow truck operators pursuant to RCW 46.55.080, 46.55.085, or 46.55.113 may be redeemed only under the following circumstances:

a. Only the legal owner, the registered owner, a person authorized in writing by the registered owner, or the vehicle’s insurer, a person who is determined and verified by the operator to have the permission of the registered owner of the vehicle or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department, or one who has purchased the vehicle or item of personal property registered or titled with the Department from the registered owner who produces proof of ownership or written authorization and signs a receipt therefor, may redeem an impounded vehicle or items of personal property registered or titled with the Department. In addition, a vehicle impounded because the operator is in violation of RCW 46.20.342(1)(c) shall not be released until a person eligible to redeem it under this subsection (A)(1)(a) satisfies the requirements of (A)(1)(b) of this section, including paying all towing, removal, and storage fees, notwithstanding the fact that the hold was ordered by a government agency. If the Department’s records show that the operator has been convicted of a violation of RCW 46.20.342 or a similar local ordinance within the past five years, the vehicle may be held for up to 30 days at the written direction of the agency ordering the vehicle impounded. A vehicle impounded because the operator is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.20.342 may be released only pursuant to a written order from the agency that ordered the vehicle impounded. An agency may issue a written order to release pursuant to a provision of an applicable state agency rule or local ordinance authorizing release on the basis of economic or personal hardship to the spouse of the operator, taking into consideration public safety factors, including the operator’s criminal history and driving record.

If a vehicle is impounded because the operator is in violation of RCW 46.20.342(1)(a) or (b), the vehicle may be held for up to 30 days at the written direction of the agency ordering the vehicle impounded. However, if the Department’s records show that the operator has been convicted of a violation of RCW 46.20.342(1)(a) or (b) or a similar local ordinance within the past five years, the vehicle may be held at the written direction of the agency ordering the vehicle impounded for up to 60 days, and for up to 90 days if the operator has two or more such prior offenses. If a vehicle is impounded because the operator is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.20.342, the vehicle may not be released until a person eligible to redeem it under this subsection (A)(1)(a) satisfies the requirements of (A)(1)(b) of this section, including paying all towing, removal, and storage fees, notwithstanding the fact that the hold was ordered by a government agency.

b. The vehicle or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department shall be released upon the presentation to any person having custody of the vehicle of commercially reasonable tender sufficient to cover the costs of towing, storage, or other services rendered during the course of towing, removing, impounding, or storing any such vehicle. In addition, if a vehicle is impounded because the operator was arrested for a violation of RCW 46.20.342 or 46.20.420 and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it must not be released to any person until the registered owner establishes with the agency that ordered the vehicle impounded that any penalties, fines, or forfeitures owed by him or her have been satisfied. Commercially reasonable tender shall include, without limitation, cash, major bank credit cards, or personal checks drawn on in-state banks if accompanied by two pieces of valid identification, one of which may be required by the operator to have a photograph. If the towing firm can determine through the customer’s bank or check verification service that the presented check would not be paid by the bank or guaranteed by the service, the towing firm may refuse to accept the check. Any person who stops payment on a personal check or credit card, or does not make restitution within 10 days from the date a check becomes insufficient due to lack of funds to a towing firm that has provided a service pursuant to this section or in any other manner defrauds the towing firm in connection with services rendered pursuant to this section shall be liable for damages in the amount of twice the towing and storage fees, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

2. a. The registered tow truck operator shall give to each person who seeks to redeem an impounded vehicle, or item of personal property registered or titled with the Department, written notice of the right of redemption and opportunity for a hearing, which notice shall be accompanied by a form to be used for requesting a hearing, the name of the person or agency authorizing the impound, and a copy of the towing and storage invoice. The registered tow truck operator shall maintain a record evidenced by the redeeming person’s signature that such notification was provided.

b. Any person seeking to redeem an impounded vehicle under this section has a right to a hearing before the East Wenatchee municipal court to contest the validity of the impoundment or the amount of towing and storage charges. The municipal court has jurisdiction to determine the issues involving impoundments authorized by agents of the municipality. Any request for a hearing shall be made in writing on the form provided for that purpose and must be received by the East Wenatchee municipal court within 10 days of the date the opportunity was provided for in subsection (A)(2)(a) of this section. At the time of the filing of the hearing request, the petitioner shall pay to the court clerk a filing fee in the same amount required for the filing of a suit in Douglas County district court. If the hearing request is not received by the East Wenatchee municipal court within the 10-day period, the right to a hearing is waived and the registered owner is liable for any towing, storage, or other impoundment charges permitted under this chapter. Upon receipt of a timely hearing request, along with the filing fee required by the court, the East Wenatchee municipal court shall proceed to hear and determine the validity of the impoundment.

3. a. The East Wenatchee municipal court, within five days after request for a hearing, shall notify the registered tow truck operator, the person requesting the hearing if not the owner, the registered and legal owners of the motor vehicle or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department, and the person or agency authorizing the impound in writing of the hearing date and time.

b. At the hearing, the person or persons requesting the hearing may produce any relevant evidence to show that the impoundment, towing, or storage fees charged were not proper. The East Wenatchee municipal court may consider a written report made under oath by the officer who authorized the impoundment in lieu of the officer’s personal appearance at the hearing.

c. At the conclusion of the hearing, the East Wenatchee municipal court shall determine whether the impoundment was proper, whether the towing or storage fees charged were in compliance with the posted rates, and who is responsible for payment of the fees. The East Wenatchee municipal court may not adjust fees or charges that are in compliance with the posted or contracted rates.

d. If the impoundment is found proper, the impoundment, towing, and storage fees as permitted under this chapter together with court costs shall be assessed against the person or persons requesting the hearing, unless the operator did not have a signed and valid impoundment authorization from a private property owner or an authorized agent.

e. If the impoundment is determined to be in violation of this chapter, then the registered and legal owners of the vehicle or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department shall bear no impoundment, towing, or storage fees, and any security shall be returned or discharged as appropriate, and the person or agency who authorized the impoundment shall be liable for the towing, storage, or other impoundment fees permitted under this chapter. The East Wenatchee municipal court shall enter judgment in favor of the registered tow truck operator against the person or agency authorizing the impound for the impoundment, towing and storage fees paid. In addition, the East Wenatchee municipal court shall enter judgment in favor of the registered and legal owners of the vehicle, or other item of personal property registered or titled with the Department, for the amount of the filing fee required by law for the impound hearing petition as well as reasonable damages for loss of the use of the vehicle during the time the same was impounded, for not less than $50.00 per day, against the person or agency authorizing the impound. However, if an impoundment arising from an alleged violation of RCW 46.20.342 or 46.20.420 is determined to be in violation of this chapter, then the law enforcement officer directing the impoundment and the government employing the officer are not liable for damages if the officer relied in good faith and without gross negligence on the records of the Department in ascertaining that the operator of the vehicle had a suspended or revoked driver’s license. If any judgment entered is not paid within 15 days of notice in writing of its entry, the East Wenatchee municipal court shall award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs against the defendant in any action to enforce the judgment. Notice of entry of judgment may be made by registered or certified mail, and proof of mailing may be made by affidavit of the party mailing the notice. Notice of the entry of the judgment shall read essentially as follows:

A vehicle or item of personal property registered or titled with the Department may be redeemed any time before the start of the auction upon payment of the applicable towing and storage fees.

B. Auction – When Permitted – Requirements.

1. If, after the expiration of 15 days from the date of mailing of notice of custody and sale required in EWMC 10.20.020(G)(2) to the registered and legal owners, the vehicle remains unclaimed and has not been listed as a stolen vehicle, then the registered tow truck operator having custody of the vehicle shall conduct a sale of the vehicle at public auction after having first published a notice of the date, place, and time of the auction in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the vehicle is located not less than three days and no more than 10 days before the date of the auction. The notice shall contain a description of the vehicle including the make, model, year, and license number and notification that a three-hour public viewing period will be available before the auction. The auction shall be held during daylight hours of a normal business day.

2. The following procedures are required in any public auction of abandoned vehicles:

a. The auction shall be held in such a manner that all persons present are given an equal time and opportunity to bid;

b. All bidders must be present at the time of auction unless they have submitted to the registered tow truck operator, who may or may not choose to use the preauction bid method, a written bid on a specific vehicle. Written bids may be submitted up to five days before the auction and shall clearly state which vehicle is being bid upon, the amount of the bid, and who is submitting the bid;

c. The open bid process, including all written bids, shall be used so that everyone knows the dollar value that must be exceeded;

d. The highest two bids received shall be recorded in written form and shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each such bidder;

e. In case the high bidder defaults, the next bidder has the right to purchase the vehicle for the amount of his or her bid;

f. The successful bidder shall apply for title within 15 days;

g. The registered tow truck operator shall post a copy of the auction procedure at the bidding site. If the bidding site is different from the licensed office location the operator shall post a clearly visible sign at the office location that describes in detail where the auction will be held. At the bidding site a copy of the newspaper advertisement that lists the vehicles for sale shall be posted;

h. All surplus moneys derived from the auction after satisfaction of the registered tow truck operator’s lien shall be remitted within 30 days to the Department for deposit in the State Motor Vehicle Fund. A report identifying the vehicles resulting in any surplus shall accompany the remitted funds. If the Director subsequently receives a valid claim from the registered vehicle owner of record as determined by the Department within one year from the date of the auction, the surplus moneys shall be remitted to such owner;

i. If an operator receives no bid, or if the operator is the successful bidder at auction, the operator shall within 30 days sell the vehicle to a licensed vehicle wrecker, hulk hauler, or scrap processor by use of the abandoned vehicle report affidavit of sale, or the operator shall apply for title to the vehicle.

3. In no case may an operator hold a vehicle for longer than 90 days without holding an auction on the vehicle, except for vehicles that are under a police or judicial hold.

4. a. In no case may the accumulation of storage charges exceed 15 days from the date of receipt of the information by the operator from the Department as provided by RCW 46.55.110(2) and EWMC 10.20.020(G)(2).

b. The failure of the registered tow truck operator to comply with the time limits provided in this chapter limits the accumulation of storage charges to five days except where delay is unavoidable. Providing incorrect or incomplete identifying information to the Department in the abandoned vehicle report shall be considered a failure to comply with these time limits if correct information is available.

C. Operator’s Lien for Services – Deficiency – Liability.

1. A registered tow truck operator who has a valid and signed impoundment authorization has a lien upon the impounded vehicle for services provided in the towing and storage of the vehicle, unless the impoundment is determined to have been invalid. The lien does not apply to personal property in or upon the vehicle that is not permanently attached to or is not an integral part of the vehicle except for items of personal property registered or titled with the Department. The registered tow truck operator also has a deficiency claim against the registered owner of the vehicle for services provided in the towing and storage of the vehicle not to exceed the sum of $500.00 less the amount bid at auction, and for vehicles of over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, the operator has a deficiency claim of $1,000 less the amount bid at auction, unless the impound is determined to be invalid. The limitation on towing and storage deficiency claims does not apply to an impound directed by a law enforcement officer. In no case may the cost of the auction or a buyer’s fee be added to the amount charged for the vehicle at the auction, the vehicle’s lien, or the overage due. A registered owner who has completed and filed with the Department the seller’s report as provided for by RCW 46.12.101 and has timely and properly filed the seller’s report, is relieved of liability under this section. The person named as a new owner of the vehicle on the timely and properly filed seller’s report shall assume liability under this section.

2. Any person who tows, removes, or otherwise disturbs any vehicle parked, stalled or otherwise left on privately owned or controlled property, and any person owning or controlling the private property, or either of them, are liable to the owner or operator of the vehicle, or each of them, for consequential and incidental damages arising from any interference with the ownership or use of the vehicle which does not comply with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 99-9 § 1, 1999)

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any East Wenatchee police officer shall inspect and may authorize the disposal of an abandoned junk vehicle.

B. The East Wenatchee police officer shall provide information on the vehicle’s registered and legal owner to the landowner.

C. Upon receiving information on the vehicle’s registered and legal owner, the landowner shall mail a notice to the registered and legal owners shown on the records of the Department. The notification shall describe the redemption procedure and the right to arrange for removal of the vehicle.

D. If the vehicle remains unclaimed more than 15 days after the landowner has mailed notification to the registered and legal owner, the landowner may dispose of the vehicle or sign an affidavit of sale to be used as a title document.

10.28.010 Obstruction restrictions.

This chapter establishes that areas around all intersections, including the entrance of driveways onto streets, must be kept clear of sight obstruction. The extent of these areas depends on a number of factors. Listed in EWMC 10.28.020 are a number of types of intersections and the regulations applicable to each. EWMC 10.28.030 establishes what may be in the area that is to be kept clear of sight obstructions.

For approach speeds greater than 40 miles per hour or when such conditions are warranted by the city engineer or street superintendent, sight distance shall meet the standards set forth in the Washington State Department of Transportation Design Manual Chapter 910.10. (Ord. 07-05 § 2, 2007; 1967 code § 10.20.010)


10.28.020 Intersections by type.

A. Type “A” Intersection. A type “A” intersection is one in which two streets converge in any configuration where one of these streets is controlled with either a stop or yield sign (the minor street) and the other street is not controlled by a stop or yield sign or other control device (the through street). The object at type “A” intersection is to allow traffic at the stop sign or approaching the yield sign on the minor street to see approaching traffic on the through street and to allow traffic on the through street to see approaching traffic on the minor street.

The dimensions of the area that must be clear of sight obstructions depend on whether the minor street is controlled by a stop or yield sign, the posted speed on the through street, and the number of through traffic lanes on the side of the through street closest to the minor street. The area that must be kept clear is in the shape of a triangle at each corner of the intersection. Below are two diagrams and tables that will establish the length of two sides of the triangle. Connecting the end points of these two sides establishes the area to be kept clear of sight obstruction. Note that the two sides of the triangle shown on the diagrams below are measured along the edge of pavement.

B. Type “B” Intersection. A type “B” intersection is one in which two streets cross and neither is controlled by a stop or yield sign or other control device. The object at these intersections is to allow traffic on both streets to see approaching traffic. The areas that must be clear of sight obstruction is in the shape of two partially overlapping triangles at each corner of the intersection. One side of each triangle is 24 feet long measured along the edge of pavement. The second side is 140 feet long measured along the edge of pavement. Connecting the end points of these sides will define the area that must be clear of sight obstruction. See the following diagram.

Type “B” Intersection 

C. Type “C” Intersection. A type “C” intersection is one in which two streets converge in any configuration and both streets are controlled by stop signs. The object at these intersections is to allow traffic stopped at the stop sign to see traffic stopped at the stop signs in every approaching traffic lane. The areas that must be clear of sight obstructions are in the shape of triangles, one at each corner of the intersection. Two sides of each triangle are 10 feet long each as measured along the edge of pavement. Connecting the ends of these two sides defines the area that must be clear of sight obstructions. See the diagram below.
[IMAGE]


D. Type “D” Intersection. A type “D” intersection is one in which all streets are controlled by a traffic light. The object at these intersections is to allow traffic that could turn on a red light to see approaching traffic and to allow traffic with a green light to see traffic that could turn on a red light. The areas that must be kept clear of sight obstructions are in the shape of a triangle, one at each corner of the intersection. The dimensions of these areas depend on the speed of the two streets. Below is a diagram and table that will establish the length of two sides of these triangles. Connecting the end points of these two sides will establish the area that must be kept clear of sight obstructions at each corner of the intersection. Note that the two sides of the triangle shown on the diagram below are measured along the edge of pavement.

E. Type “E” Intersections. A type “E” intersection is an intersection in which a driveway or access driveway serving any use other than residential use enters a street. The object at these intersections is to allow traffic coming out of the driveway or vehicular access easement or tract to see approaching traffic. These intersections are regulated as Type “A” intersections as if the driveway or vehicular access easement or tract is the minor street controlled with a stop sign and the street is the through street.

F. Type “F” Intersection. A type “F” intersection is an intersection in which a driveway or vehicular access easement or tract serving exclusively residential uses enters a street. The object at these intersections is to allow traffic coming out of the driveway or vehicular access easement or tract to see approaching traffic. The areas that must be clear of sight obstructions are the areas enclosed within triangles, one at each corner of the intersection. Two sides of each triangle area are 10 feet long each as measured along the edge of pavement. Connecting the ends of these two sides defines the area that must be clear of sight obstruction. See the diagram below.

Type “F” Intersection

G. One-Way Streets and Streets with Median Barriers. The provisions of this section are written to apply to streets with one-way traffic and streets with a median barrier. The city engineer or street superintendent may modify the requirements of this section to fulfill the purpose of these regulations for intersections including a one-way street or a street with a median barrier.

H. Intersections Not Specifically Regulated. The city engineer or street superintendent shall establish the area that must be clear of sight obstructions on a case-by-case basis for intersections containing more than two streets and for other intersections that are not specifically regulated in subsections A through F of this section. (Ord. 07-05 § 2, 2007)


10.28.030 Permissible intrusion in the area to be kept clear of sight obstruction.

A. General. Except as stated in subsection B of this section or unless specifically approved by the city engineer or street superintendent, no sight obstruction may be within the area to be kept clear. A sight obstruction is considered any object whose height is greater than three feet above the grade of the respective centerlines of the intersecting street, driveway, or vehicular access easement or tract.

B. Exceptions. The following are permitted to be within the area that must be clear of sight obstructions:

Natural and fabricated objects and natural topography of the ground if the city engineer or street superintendent determines that adequate visual access is available. However, to fulfill the intent of this section, the city engineer or street superintendent may require land surface modification as part of any development activity on the subject property. Any vegetation extending into the sight triangle shall be pruned to maintain a minimum obstruction-free height of eight feet above the finished ground level or as needed to provide adequate sight distance in accordance with EWMC 10.28.010 and 10.28.020. All signs and utility appurtenances shall be located to minimize sight obstructions at the intersections and their locations shall be approved by the city engineer or street superintendent. (Ord. 07-05 § 2, 2007)


10.28.040 Obstruction deemed nuisance – Abatement and enforcement – Lien.

In addition to other remedies as may be provided herein, any obstruction maintained in violation of this chapter shall be deemed a nuisance as defined in EWMC 8.20.020(K)(2)(e).

10.48.040 General provisions.

A. When Connection Permits Are Required. Every owner of property which abuts a state highway where limited access rights have not been acquired, has a right to reasonable access, but may not have the right to a particular means of access to the state highway system.

1. The right of access to the state highway may be restricted if, pursuant to local regulation, reasonable access to the state highway can be provided by way of another public road which abuts the property.

2. All new connections, including alterations and improvements to existing connections to state highways, shall require a connection permit. Such permits, if issued, shall be issued only after issuance of development approval where such approval is required, unless other interagency coordination procedures are in effect.

3. The alteration or closure of any existing access connection caused by changes to the character, intensity of development, or use of the property served by the connection, or the construction of any new access connection, shall not be initiated prior to obtaining a connection permit from the city.

4. Use of a new connection at the location specified in the permit is not authorized until the permittee constructs or modifies the connection, in accordance with the permit requirements.

5. If a property owner or permittee holding a valid connection permit wishes to change the character, use or intensity of the property or development served by the connection, the city must be contacted to determine whether a new connection permit would be required.

B. Responsibility for Other Approvals. Connection permits authorize construction improvements to be built by the permittee on city or Department right-of-way. It is the responsibility of the applicant or permittee to obtain any other local permits or other agency approvals that may be required, including satisfaction of all environmental regulations. It is also the responsibility of the applicant to acquire any property rights necessary to provide continuity from the applicant’s property to the city or state highway right-of-way, if the applicant’s property does not abut the right-of-way.

C. Cost of Construction.

1. Permittee. The cost of construction or modification of a connection shall be the responsibility of the permittee, including the cost of modification of any connection required, as a result of changes in property site use.

2. City. Existing permitted connections impacted by the city’s work program and which, in the consideration of the city, necessitate modification, relocation, or replacement in order to meet current city connection location, quantity, spacing and design standards, shall be modified, relocated, or replaced in kind by the city at no cost to the permittee. The cost of enhancements or modifications to the altered, relocated or replaced connection desired by the permittee shall be the responsibility of the permittee.

D. City Responsibility. The city has the responsibility to issue permits and authority to approve, disapprove, and revoke such permits, and to close connections, with cause. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.050 Connection categories.

All connections, public or private, shall be determined by the city to be in one of the following categories:

A. “Category I – minimum connection” provides connection to the state highway system for up to 10 single-family residences, a duplex, or a small multifamily complex of up to 10 dwelling units, which use a common connection. The category shall also apply to permanent connections to agricultural and forest lands, including field entrances; connections for the operation, maintenance, and repair of utilities; and connections serving other low volume traffic generators expected to have an average weekday vehicle trip ends (AWDVTE) of 100 or less.

B. “Category II – minor connection” provides connection to the state highway system for medium volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE of 1,500 or less, but not included in Category I.

C. “Category III – major connection” provides connection to the state highway system for high volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE exceeding 1,500.

D. “Category IV – temporary connection” provides a temporary, time-limited connection to the state highway system for a specific property, for a specific use with a specific traffic volume. Such uses include, but are not limited to, logging, forest land clearing, temporary agricultural uses, temporary construction, and temporary emergency access. The city, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to remove any temporary connection at the expense of the property owner after the expiration of the permit. Further, a temporary connection permit does not bind the city in any way to the future issuance of a permanent connection permit at the temporary connection location.

E. “Nonconforming connection” designation may be issued for Category I through IV permits after an analysis and determination by the city that a conforming connection cannot be made, and a finding that the denial of a connection would leave the property without a reasonable means of access to the public road system. In such instances, the permit shall be noted as nonconforming and contain specific restrictions and provisions, including limits on the maximum vehicular use of the connection, the future availability of alternate means of access for which a conforming connection permit could be obtained, the removal of the nonconforming connection at the time the conforming access is available, and other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of Chapter 47.50 RCW. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.060 Conceptual review.

The purpose of the conceptual review is to expedite the overall review process by establishing the permit category, number, type, and general location of connections to the property early in the planning stages of a proposed development or a proposed significant change in property site use, or to determine that the connection, as requested, cannot be permitted.

A. Prior to filing a connection permit application and prior to receipt of development approval, all permit applicants are strongly encouraged to request, in writing, a conceptual review of the site plan and proposed connection locations with the city.

B. Those applicants applying for Category II and Category III connections are required to go through the conceptual review process as described herein.

C. The conceptual review does not constitute final city approval of the location and design of the connection.

D. The city shall establish the date for a conceptual review meeting if it is determined to be necessary. The meeting is to be held within two weeks of the receipt of the written request, unless a later date is requested by the applicant. If a meeting is scheduled, representatives of all local and state governmental land use and transportation planning authorities will be invited to attend.

E. Within four weeks following the conceptual review meeting, or receipt of the request if no meeting is scheduled, the city will provide the applicant written notice of the conceptual review findings, provided all needed information to complete the review has been received from the applicant. These findings are nonbinding on the city and the developer.

F. Additional detailed information received during the application process, changes in the proposed development, or changes in the existing or planned operational characteristics of the state highway system may necessitate modifications of the connections agreed to in the conceptual approval. The conceptual review findings can be used by the developer in the site plan review/approval process. These findings can indicate coordination of connection location, vehicle quantity, and design with the city and can serve as the preliminary city findings on the proposed connections. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.070 Connection spacing and standards.

All new connections shall conform to the classification of that section of highway, as determined by the Department, and as a minimum shall meet spacing and standards requirements as set forth in Chapter 468-52 WAC as the same now exists or as may be hereafter amended and which is adopted herein by this reference. The city shall review and interpret the classification and spacing requirements for each application after consultation with the Department. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)

C. Permit Conditions. Any special requirements or provisions for the connection including off-site mitigation, shall be clearly and specifically identified as part of the permit. Failure by the applicant, or permittee, to abide by the permit provisions shall be sufficient cause for the city to initiate action to alter the connection, or to revoke the permit and close the connection, at the expense of the permittee. The permit requirements shall be binding on the permittee, the permittee’s successors, heirs and assigns, the permit application signatories, and all future owners and occupants of the property. The applicant may challenge the permit conditions by applying for an appeal pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.110 Construction requirements.

A. Preconstruction Conference. The city may require a preconstruction conference prior to any work being performed on the city’s, or the Department’s, right-of-way. When required by provisions in the permit, the city will schedule a preconstruction conference. The preconstruction conference should be attended by the necessary personnel to assure compliance with the terms and provisions of the permit.

Substantial construction of the connection shall begin within 90 days of the effective date of the permit, unless a longer time is approved by the city, or a time extension is requested by the applicant, and approved by the city. Construction shall be completed within 120 days of the date of issuance of the permit, unless a time extension is approved by the city.

As a condition of the permit, the city may further limit construction time, if the city determines that such limitation is warranted. Failure to comply with the time limits specified in the permit shall result in an automatic expiration of the permit, following written notification to the permittee. For any permit which expires for failure to begin construction, or to complete construction within the specified time limits, the city may require a new application fee prior to the initiation of any construction.

C. Posting of Permit. The approved connection permit shall be displayed in a prominent location, protected from the weather, within the vicinity of the connection construction.

D. Disruption of Traffic. All construction and/or maintenance within the city’s, or the Department’s, right-of-way, shall conform to the provisions of the connection permit, the “Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices” (MUTCD); the Department’s current “Design Manual,” the current “Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction” and city construction standards. The city, or Department, may require or restrict hours of construction, to minimize disruption of traffic on the state highway system. If construction activity within the city’s, or the Department’s, right-of-way causes undue disruption of traffic or creates safety hazards on a state highway, or if the construction activity is not in compliance with the traffic control specifications in the permit, the city shall advise the permittee, or the permittee’s contractor of the need for immediate corrective action, and may order immediate suspension of all or part of the work, if deemed necessary. Failure to comply with this provision may result in permit modification or revocation.

E. Traffic Signals and Other Traffic Control Devices. Traffic signals and other traffic control devices installed by permittee shall conform to MUTCD, and city and Department design and construction standards. The permittee is responsible for securing any state and local permits needed for traffic signalization, and regulatory signing and marking.

F. Connection Construction Inspection. For Category II and Category III connections, the city may require the permittee, the developer, or landowner to provide inspection of construction by a professional engineer, registered in accordance with Chapter 18.43 RCW, and certification that connection construction is in accordance with permit provisions and appropriate Department standards. The city may, but is not required to, do the inspection at the applicant’s expense, as provided in the developer agreement. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.120 Nonconforming connection permits.

The city may issue a permit for a connection not meeting the Department and city location and spacing criteria standards, if it finds that a conforming connection is not attainable at the time of the permit application submittal, and that denial would leave the property without a reasonable means of connection to the public road system. The city will consult with the Department before issuing any nonconforming connection permit. The city may issue a connection permit requiring a legally enforceable joint-use connection, when determined to be in the best interest of the city, or state, for restoring or maintaining the operational efficiency and safety of the state highway. Nonconforming connection permits shall specify conditions or limits including:

A. Traffic Volume. The maximum vehicular usage of the connection shall be specified in the permit.

B. Future Alternate Access. The permit shall specify that a conforming connection be constructed, when future alternate means of access become available, and that the nonconforming connection be removed.

C. Users. The permit shall specify the properties to be served by the connection; and any other conditions, as necessary, to carry out the provisions of Chapter 47.50 RCW. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.130 Changes in property site use.

The connection permit is issued to the permittee for a particular type of land use, generating specific projected traffic volumes at the final stage of proposed development. Any changes made in the use, intensity of development, type of traffic, or traffic flow of the property requires the permittee, their assignee, or property owner to contact the city to determine if further analysis is needed to determine if the change is significant and would require a new permit and/or modifications to the connection. An engineering study, signed and sealed by a professional engineer, registered in accordance with Chapter 18.43 RCW, may be required to document the extent of the change. If modification of the existing connection is required, based on a significant change as determined by the city, the permittee shall acquire a new permit, prior to the initiation of any on-site construction to the connection or to the property.

A. Significant Change. A significant change is one that would cause a change in the category of the connection permit, or one that causes an operational, safety, or maintenance problem on the state highway system.

B. Notification. Failure to contact the city to determine the need for connection modifications or to apply for a new permit for such modifications, prior to initiation of property improvements, land use changes or traffic flow alteration actions, shall result in notification to the property owner of intent to revoke the existing permit, and closure of the connection to the property.

C. Costs. The permittee is responsible for all costs associated with connection removal, relocation or modification, caused by increased or altered traffic flows, necessitated by changes to facilities, use, or to the nature of the use on the property. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.140 Permit modification, revocation, closure of permitted connection.

A. Revocation Criteria. All connection permits issued by the city, prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, remain valid until revoked.

The city may initiate action to revoke any permit if significant changes have occurred in the use, design, or traffic flow of the property, requiring the relocation, alteration or closure of the connection; if the connection was not constructed at the location, or to the design specified in the permit; or if the permit provisions were not met; or if the connection causes a safety or operational problem on the state highway system. The process to be followed by the city in the revocation of permits, shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter.

B. Notification, Correction of Deficiencies. The city shall serve notice to the permittee, permittee’s successors or assigns, or property owner, with a copy to the occupant, for any connection found to be in noncompliance with the conditions of the permit or this chapter. The notice will identify and request that the deficiencies be corrected within 30 days of service of the notice. The notice shall further advise that the city’s determination of noncompliance or deficiencies, shall become final and conclusive 30 calendar days following service of the notice unless the violations are corrected, or an appeal pursuant to EWMC 10.48.170 is requested by the permittee, permittee’s successor or assigns, or the property owner.

C. Costs. The permittee, assignee, successor, or property owner shall be responsible for the costs of closure, due to revocation of a connection permit, pursuant to this chapter.

D. Emergency Action. This chapter shall not restrict the city’s right to take immediate remedial action, including the closure of a connection, if there is an immediate and serious danger to public health, safety, and welfare, pursuant to Chapter 47.32 RCW. In such event, the city shall conform to the provisions for emergency adjudicative proceedings in RCW 34.05.479 which is hereby adopted by this reference as if fully set forth as it now exists of may hereafter be amended. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.150 Closure of unpermitted connections – Closure criteria, permit requirements.

Any unpermitted connections to the state highway system which were in existence on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not require the issuance of a permit, and may continue to provide connection to the state highway system, unless the property owner had received written notification from the city initiating connection closure prior to the effective date of the ordinance, or unless the city determines that the unpermitted connection does not meet minimum acceptable standards of highway safety. The city may require that a permit be obtained if a significant change occurs in the use, design, or traffic flow of the connection, or of the state highway to which it provides access. If a permit is not obtained, the city may initiate action to close the unpermitted connection point, pursuant to RCW 47.50.040. Any unpermitted connection opened subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance, is subject to closure by the city. The process to be followed, by the city, in the closure of an unpermitted connection, shall as follows:

A. Notification. The city shall serve written notice, by personal service or regular U.S. mail upon the property owner of a connection to a state highway which is found by the city to be unpermitted. This notice shall clearly describe the highway connection violation and shall establish a 30-day time limit for either applying for a connection permit or requesting an appeal, pursuant to EWMC 10.48.170. The sole issue to be determined at the appeal is whether a permit should be required. The notice will further advise the property owner that failure to act in either of the prescribed ways, within the time period, will result in city closure of the unpermitted connection.

B. Permit Application. If a permit application is filed within the 30 days, and the application is denied, the city shall notify the property owner of the denial. The property owner may revise the permit application, or appeal the decision pursuant to this chapter, within 30 days. Failure to act in either of those prescribed ways within the time period set forth in the rules will result in city closure of the unpermitted connection. If the location and design of the connection, in the permit application, are acceptable to the city, the existing connection may continue to be used for a specified period of time, determined by the city, or until the connection specified in the permit application is constructed.

C. Approval Conditions. Modifications, relocation, or closure of unpermitted connections may be required by the city, as a requirement of permit approval, subject to the appeal process set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.160 Department construction projects.

During construction of Department projects, connections will be provided as replacements for existing approved permitted connections, that are consistent with all current Department spacing, location, and design standards, based on the following conditions:

A. Nonconforming Connections. All nonconforming connections will be examined to determine if the construction project will require relocation, alteration, or closure of the connection to make it conforming.

B. Application of Current Standards. The number and location of connections shall be modified to the maximum extent possible to meet current Department spacing, location, and design standards. Where current Department standards cannot be met, the connection shall be classified as nonconforming.

C. New Connections, Modifications. The Department shall allow new or require modification of existing connections if a connection permit application is made and approved.

D. Replacement of Existing Connection. When connections are made as part of a Department construction project replacing existing connection points without material differences, no additional permit shall be required.

E. New Connection – Cost. The construction of new connection points, if approved by the Department, shall be done at the owner’s expense by either the Department’s contractor as part of the roadway improvement or by the owner’s contractor at the Department’s option.

F. Modification – Cost. If the modification of the connection point is more extensive than the routine replacement of an existing connection, the owner shall also participate in the differential cost.

G. Work by Permittee’s Contractor. The Department shall require that work done by the owner’s contractor be accomplished at the completion of the Department’s contract or be scheduled so as not to interfere with the Department’s contractor. The Department may require a surety bond prior to construction of the connection in accordance with EWMC 10.48.090. (Ord. 95-14 § 1, 1995)


10.48.170 Appeals.

A. Application.

The imposition of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a reasonable time; and when not otherwise specified, each 10 days that prohibited conditions are maintained shall constitute a separate offense.

The presence of the city street superintendent during the performance of any excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of its responsibilities under this chapter.

A. The city of East Wenatchee will incorporate complete streets principles into the early planning and design of transportation projects. However, not all roadways are suitable for all complete streets components; in some cases, a limited range of modal choices may be appropriate. Such circumstances include the following:

1. Where the establishment of such facilities would be detrimental to public health or safety; or

2. Where there is no documented current or anticipated need for accommodation for non-motorized roadway users or the street is not a current or planned transit route; or

3. Where the project involves a roadway on which nonmotorized use is prohibited by law; or

4. Where the cost for a particular complete street design recommendation would be excessively disproportionate to the need of that particular improvement, with due consideration given to future users; or

5. Where there would be significant adverse environmental impacts to streams, wetlands, steep slopes, or other critical areas; or

6. Where their inclusion in a small, isolated project would create a very short section of improvements with problematic transitions on either end or that are in an isolated area unlikely to be followed by similar improvements at either end resulting in a facility that would have no connectivity for users; or

7. Where the project is routine maintenance of the transportation network that does not change the geometry or operations, such as striping, cleaning, sweeping, crack sealing, spot repair and surface treatments such as chip sealing or other similar interim surface preservation measures.

B. The exceptions in subsections (A)(1) through (6) of this section require documentation and supporting data to be approved by the city council upon review and recommendation from the city engineer. (Ord. 18-16 § 5, 2018)

12.50.010 Purpose.

A. These minimum standards for development provide requirements for street and bridge design, construction and reconstruction. In establishing the minimum standards for development, the city engineer has sought to encourage standardization and internationality of street design elements. Considerations include safety, convenience, aesthetics, proper drainage, and maintenance.

B. The city’s permitting, certification or licensing activities require the adoption of standards to guide individuals and entities in the administrative process of procuring the necessary city approvals. The city must also have flexibility to carry out its general duty to provide streets, streets and highways for the diverse and changing needs of the traveling public. Accordingly, these standards are not intended to represent the legal standard by which the city’s duty to the traveling public is to be measured.

C. The decision to use a particular street design element at a particular location should be made on the basis of an engineering analysis of the location. Thus, while this document provides minimum requirements for design, it is not a substitute for professional engineering judgment. It is the intent that the provisions of these standards be international requirements for street and bridge design, but may not be appropriate for all locations and existing situations.

D. These standards cannot provide for all situations. It is intended to assist, but not substitute for, competent work by design professionals. It is expected that each professional bring to each project the best of their skills and abilities. These standards are also not intended to unreasonably limit any innovative or creative effort which could result in the more effective and appropriate combination of design, cost savings, or both. Any proposed departure from these standards will be judged on the likelihood that such a departure or variance will produce a compensating or comparable result, adequate in every way, for the street user and city resident. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.020 Scope and applicability.

A. Except as exempted in EWMC 12.50.050, all requirements contained in these standards, together with any and all amendments thereto, shall apply to all street, bridge, and other new construction and reconstruction of city and private streets in the city of East Wenatchee or as may be required as a condition of development approval processed in accordance with EWMC Titles 15, 16, and 17 within East Wenatchee, and as far as practicable and feasible to the reconstruction of existing city and private streets in East Wenatchee. These standards shall also apply to all public and private accesses, and driveways connecting to public streets; usage of unopened city rights-of-way; location and installation of new utilities; and pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian facilities. In cases of any ambiguity or dispute over interpretation or application of the provisions of these standards, the decision of the city engineer shall be final subjective to administrative appeal as set forth in Chapter 19.06 EWMC.

B. These standards apply to modifications of street features of existing facilities which are within the scope of reconstruction or capital improvement projects when so required by the city or to the extent they are expressly referred to in project plans and specifications. 

C. These standards are applied as follows: 

1. Mandatory standards are those considered most essential to the achievement of overall design objectives. Mandatory standards use the word “shall.” 

2. Advisory standards allow some flexibility in application to accommodate design constraints or to be compatible with local conditions. Advisory standards use the word “should.” 

3. All standards other than the mandatory and advisory, indicated with the word “may,” are permissive with no requirement intended. 

D. If these standards are silent regarding a specific issue regarding the planning, design or construction of a street or bridge, then the AASHTO Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, WSDOT Standard Plans and Specifications, WSDOT Construction Manual, and the WSDOT City and County Design Standards as contained within the WSDOT Local Agency Guidelines shall provide guidance as to the requirements subject to approval by the city engineer.

12.50.090 Project acceptance.

A. The city engineer shall rely upon the certification and approval of the street and drainage plans and calculations by the applicant’s engineer for approval of the project. The city engineer’s acceptance of the plans shall not relieve the applicant or the applicant’s engineer from any liability related to portions of the design that are not in conformance with these standards nor do not follow good engineering practice. 

B. Upon receipt of the project plans and calculations, the city engineer will review the work of the applicant’s engineer for accuracy and completeness. The plans and calculations will either be accepted by the city or returned for revisions. All revisions are subject to hourly review fees as set forth in the current fee schedule. Project acceptance occurs when the city engineer signs the plans and review fees are paid. 

C. The acceptance of plans shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of approval by the city engineer. Construction in accordance with the approved plans must be completed within this period. If not completed within this period, the plans shall be resubmitted to the city engineer for review and any revisions or modifications necessary to meet the standards in effect at the time of resubmittal shall be made. Resubmittal fees equal to new application fees shall be paid before the plans can be reviewed and approved by the city. 

D. A traffic impact analysis shall only be valid for a period of five years from the date of approval of the development. If the project is not completed within this time period, the traffic impact analysis shall be updated and resubmitted to the city engineer for review and concurrence prior to project acceptance. Resubmittal fees equal to new application fees shall be paid before the updated analysis is reviewed and approved by the city. 

E. Requests for modifications made during the construction of a project that are not in conflict with the preliminary plat approval conditions shall be approved by the city engineer and city fire marshal, when applicable, prior to any changes being made in the field. 

F. Depending upon the nature of the modifications and in all cases where there is a conflict with the preliminary plat approval conditions, approval of the hearing body for the specific type of permit will also be required as provided for in EWMC Title 19. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.100 Alternatives.

A. These standards represent reasonable approaches based on past experience in East Wenatchee and other jurisdictions. These standards indicate the appropriate practice under most conditions. 

B. Engineering design is an endeavor that examines alternative solutions to real world situations and accordingly, these standards are not provided to hamper the introduction of new ideas. It is fully expected that creative engineering will continue to take place. Situations will present themselves where alternatives may be preferred to allow conformance with existing conditions, to overcome adverse topography or to allow for more affordable solutions without adversely affecting safety, maintainability or aesthetics. These standards are intended to provide predictability yet still allow for the flexibility necessary for innovation. 

C. Alternatives to these standards shall be proposed at the preapplication meeting and evaluated and accepted prior to the application submittal. 

D. The alternative request shall be in writing, submitted to the city engineer, and address the following points: 

1. Specifically outline the reason for the alternative request. 

2. Specify the chapter and section for which the alternative is requested. 

3. Provide supporting evidence demonstrating that an alternative from these standards is based on sound engineering judgment that the requirements for safety, function, appearance, fire protection and maintainability are fully met and complies with the East Wenatchee comprehensive plan and appropriate subarea plan if applicable. 

4. The above information shall be used by the city engineer in evaluating requests for the use of alternatives to these standards. Alternative requests that conflict with the International Fire Code as adopted by East Wenatchee shall also require written concurrence from the Douglas County Fire District No. 2 fire marshal. 

5. Specify how the alternative proposal is equivalent to what would be achieved if the standards were followed. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.110 Performance assurance.

A. Construction Performance.

1. In lieu of the completion of any required improvements prior to approval of a final plat, short plat, or other land-use action, the city engineer may accept a performance guarantee in an amount and with satisfactory surety and conditions providing for and securing to East Wenatchee the actual design, construction and installation of such improvements within a period specified by the city engineer. The city engineer will enforce the guarantee through appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If a surety bond is provided, the amount of the bond shall not be less than 125 percent of the estimated design and construction cost as reviewed and concurred in by the city engineer. See EWMC 16.24.180 through 16.24.210 for specific instructions. 

2. The amount of the performance guarantee may be reduced during construction, as determined by the city engineer and based upon the amount of progress payments. At no time will the performance guarantee amount be reduced to less than 30 percent of the original amount or $5,000, whichever is greater. 

3. Once a performance assurance is approved by the city, building permits or any additional permits required by the city may be issued prior to completion and approval of all street, drainage and utility construction. Building permits will only be issued if the streets are determined to be usable unless otherwise exempted by the fire marshal. 

4. Prior to beginning construction activities within existing right-of-way, a permit to perform work in the right-of-way shall be secured. Restoration sureties may be required by the city engineer in the manner provided for in this section.

B. Maintenance Performance.

1. The developer shall warrant all portions of construction work done in the right-of-way for a period of 18 months after completion or acceptance, whichever is later, against defective workmanship and materials. The developer shall keep the streets and public improvements in good order and repair during the 18-month period. 

2. This warranty shall be secured with a form of collateral acceptable to the city engineer in conformance with the requirements of EWMC 16.24.180 through 16.24.210. The amount of this collateral shall be 15 percent of the original estimated or final design and construction cost as reviewed and concurred in by the city engineer or $5,000, whichever is greater. 

3. This warranty collateral shall be submitted concurrently with a request for release of the construction performance guarantee and the 18-month warranty period shall commence on the date of said release of the guarantee. The warranty collateral shall not be drawn upon. This warranty collateral will be held 18 months by East Wenatchee and will cover all improvements associated with the street system and its related drainage facilities. 

4. During the course of the warranty period, periodic inspections will be conducted by the city engineer or his/her representative. If deficiencies are observed, other than normal deterioration, they shall be brought to the attention of the developer for his/her action. At the end of the 18-month period, the city engineer shall conduct a final inspection of the improvements and determine all work and an estimate of the cost necessary to restore the street, drainage facilities and any other improvements to their original design condition and provide said information to the developer. The developer shall have the option to perform all necessary restoration within a reasonable time as may be negotiated with the city engineer. Should any or all of the restoration not be satisfactorily accomplished by the developer, the city engineer will arrange for the accomplishment of the repairs. This restoration amount shall be deducted from the warranty collateral and the balance returned to the developer with an itemized list of all deductions; if the cost of the restoration work done by the city exceeds the amount of the warranty collateral, the developer shall be billed by the city for the balance including an itemized statement of all work performed. 

5. Maintenance guarantees will not be required when the required construction performance guarantee is $1,000 or less. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.120 Violations and penalties.

A. Failure to comply with these standards shall be cause for withholding or withdrawing approval of plans, forfeiture of financial security or nonacceptance of the work by the city. 

B. Violation of any provisions of these standards by any person, firm or corporation shall be pursued and resolved in the same manner as any violation of East Wenatchee Municipal Code as provided for in Chapter 16.32 or 17.104 EWMC.

C. Notwithstanding the existence or use of any other remedy, the director or city engineer may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any conditions that constitute or will constitute a violation of these standards or other regulations herein adopted. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.130 Severability.

If any part of these standards or its application to any person is, for any reason, declared invalid, illegal, or unconstitutional, in whole or in part by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction, said decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.140 Fees.

Fees shall be assessed in accordance with the current development fee schedule as approved by the East Wenatchee city council. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.150 Transportation system and frontage improvements.

Frontage improvements are required for all improvement and development projects that have frontage on a public street, including state highways, that does not meet current standards. The transportation system and frontage improvements shall be in place, or be secured with a bond or by an approved deferred improvement agreement prior to final approval of the project or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first, for that development or phase. 

A. Transportation Improvements – Off-Site. Off-site transportation improvements such as street widening, additional right-of-way, paving, geometric improvements, additional lanes, traffic control devices, bridge and drainage structure modifications, pedestrian facilities, bike paths and intersection improvements away from the development shall be required where identified by a traffic impact analysis or otherwise be determined to be necessary as part of the development review process. 

The East Wenatchee city engineer will also review the right-of-way status of abutting and adjoining city streets to determine if additional right-of-way is needed to meet the current street standards as set forth in these standards. 

All such required off-site improvements must be completed or other financing arrangements made as approved by the city prior to final development approval. Alternate financing methods such as use of street benefit assessment reimbursement areas as set forth in Chapter 12.20 EWMC may be used. 

B. Frontage Improvements – General Requirements.

1. Frontage improvements may be required for all improvement and development projects that have frontage on a public street, including state highways. Frontage improvements shall consist of, but not be limited to, dedication of right-of-way, street widening, turn lanes, traffic signals, bus stop pads, bus shelter pads, passenger shelters, bus pull-outs, pedestrian facilities, bike paths where designated in the current city comprehensive plan and safety and drainage improvements, including all tributary runoff. 

2. Frontage improvements, including the dedication of right-of-way, shall be installed at the time of development unless otherwise approved by the city. 

3. The developer shall coordinate the design and construction with the city, Washington State Department of Transportation, when appropriate, and Link Transit when frontage improvements include bus stop pads, shelter pads and bus shelters. Prescription of a passenger shelter shall also incorporate the condition that the shelter meets Link Transit’s standard passenger shelter specifications. 

C. Exceptions. The city engineer may approve an alternative as set out in subsection D of this section to the installation of frontage improvements, not including dedication of right-of-way, if one or more of the following conditions apply: 

1. The design grade and alignment of the abutting streets cannot be determined at the time of construction of the development. 

2. The installation of frontage improvements required for the development would create or intensify a hazard to public safety. 

3. The installation of frontage improvements required for the development could be more safely, efficiently, and effectively implemented if done concurrently with the installation of improvements required for other developments along the same street frontage. 

D. Deferral of Improvements (Refer to Chapter 15.48 EWMC). Any deferred frontage improvement shall be secured for installation at a later date by an agreement and covenant between the city and the property owner whereby the property owner agrees to three methods of installation of the deferred frontage improvements. This agreement and covenant shall be executed before the issuance of any improvement and development permits. The city engineer shall select which method to enforce against the property owner at the time when the deferred frontage improvements are required to be installed. Three methods the property owner shall agree to are: 

1. Commitment to Participate in an Improvement District. The property owner shall execute and record an agreement with the city and covenant running with the land that ensures the participation of the subject property owner in any local improvement district (Chapter 35.43 RCW), street improvement district (Chapter 36.88 RCW), or transportation benefit district (Chapter 36.73 RCW) formed for the construction of such frontage improvements. Said document shall be in a form acceptable to the city prosecuting attorney’s office and shall be effective for a period not exceeding 10 years from the date of recording. This document shall bind the owner and its designees, heirs, transferees, donees, and/or successors in interest. 

2. Agreement to Participate in Improvement Project. The property owner shall execute and record an agreement with the city and covenant running with the land that ensures the participation of the subject property owner in an improvement project not supported by an improvement district that encompasses the said deferred frontage improvements by paying their share thereof. Such share shall be equal to the city’s costs for installing the deferred frontage improvements. The city shall provide a nonbinding total cost estimate to the property owner at the time the agreement is entered into including a disclaimer that the total cost of the project at the time of construction may vary due to inflation, changes in design standards or other governmental laws and regulations. A contract shall be developed at the time the improvement project is developed outlining the level of participation by the subject property owner in said project and the manner in which payment is to be made; provided, that the financial responsibility of the subject property owner shall not exceed the cost of said deferred frontage improvements at the time of the improvement project. Such an agreement and covenant shall bind the owner and its assignees, heirs, transferees, donees, and/or successors in interest. The agreement and covenant document shall be effective for a period of 10 years from the date of recording. 

3. Voluntary Payments. See RCW 82.02.020 and the provisions of Chapter 43.21C RCW, the State Environmental Policy Act. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.160 Withdrawal of approval/acceptance.

At the discretion of the city engineer, errors and omissions in the approved/accepted plans or information used as a basis for such approvals/acceptances may constitute grounds for withdrawal of any approvals/acceptances and/or stoppage of any or all permitted work. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to show cause why such work should continue, and make such changes in plans that may be required by the city before the plans are reapproved. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.170 Site maintenance.

A. The applicant shall schedule and control the work to comply with all applicable provisions of city development regulations and applicable state and federal laws and regulations to prevent any hazards to public safety, health and welfare. 

B. On existing streets, two-way traffic and all existing lanes of traffic shall be maintained at all times unless detour and/or traffic control plans have been approved in advance by the city engineer. 

C. Streets shall be kept free of dirt and debris. 

D. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities shall be kept free of obstructions. 

E. Pedestrian and vehicular access to occupied buildings shall be maintained except where written approval from the building owner has been obtained. 

F. Drainage facilities shall be maintained and fully functional and storm water, erosion, and sedimentation control devices shall be maintained and fully functional. 

G. On-site grading shall be done in a manner to minimize off-site erosion and siltation in conformance with all statutory requirements, permits and approved plans. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.50.180 Correspondence.

All correspondence, including letters, reports, and plans, shall be clearly labeled with the city project number as assigned by the department. Submittals or correspondence without this identification number will not be accepted and will not be reviewed. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)

The applicable standards shall be determined by the location, function (city or private), functional classification (arterial, collector or access) and projected traffic volumes and land use patterns. Terrain (flat, rolling, mountainous) will also enter into standards related to design speed and maximum grade. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.51.020 Classification definitions.

A. Location. A primary determination of the applicable portions of these standards that must be used is based on the location of the proposed street or street construction or improvement. In most cases, the following will govern what city street standards will apply.

1. Urban. An “urban” location is defined as that area within a federally designated urban or urbanized area or a designated urban growth area as established by Douglas County under the Growth Management Act. Appropriate maps showing the boundaries are available from the city of East Wenatchee.

B. Function.

1. City Streets. City streets are those that are continuously open to general public travel and have been accepted by the city into the city street system. Streets that are dedicated to the public shall become city streets upon completion of the construction to city standards, acceptance of the completed construction by the city engineer, and approval of the final plat or other instrument as appropriate by the city. All others must be put on the city street system by means of the street establishment process as specified in Chapter 36.81 RCW and be constructed to city standards for public streets.

2. Private Streets. Private streets are all streets not designated as public streets and not open to general public travel.

C. Functional Classification – General.

1. Urban Classification. All city streets in urban areas are classified as urban local access, urban collector, urban minor arterial or urban principal arterial. New streets and any modifications to existing connector or frontage streets that may be required as a condition of development approval shall meet the minimum design requirements for urban streets as specified in these standards. Appropriate maps showing the functional classifications are available from the city of East Wenatchee.

D. Functional Classification – Descriptions.

1. Principal Arterial. Principal arterials permit traffic flow through and between cities and towns and between major elements of the urban areas. They are of great importance in the regional transportation system as they interconnect major traffic generators, such as central business districts and regional shopping centers, to other major activity centers and carry a high proportion of the total area travel on a minimum of street mileage. Principal arterials frequently carry important intra-urban as well as inter-city bus routes.

Many principal arterials are fully or partially access controlled facilities emphasizing the through movement of traffic. Within the category are (a) interstates, (b) other freeways and expressways, and (c) other principal arterials. Spacing of principal arterials may vary from less than one mile in highly developed central business areas to five miles or more in sparsely developed urban fringes. Principal arterials generally comprise five to 10 percent of the urban system.

2. Minor Arterial. Minor arterials collect and distribute traffic from principal arterials to lesser-classified streets, or allow for traffic to directly access their destination. In urban areas, they serve secondary traffic generators such as community business centers, neighborhood shopping centers, multiple residence areas, and traffic from neighborhood to neighborhood within a community. Urban bus routes generally follow these facilities. Access to land use activities is generally prohibited. Such facilities are usually spaced under two miles apart in urban fringes and in core areas can be spaced one-eighth to one-half mile apart.

3. Collectors. Urban collectors provide for land access and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas. They distribute traffic movements from such areas to the arterial system. Half-mile spacing is common in more developed areas. Collectors do not handle long through trips and are not continuous for any great length. They generally account for five to 10 percent of the total street system.

4. Local Access Streets. All public streets, not otherwise classified as an arterial or collector, comprise the local access system. These streets primarily serve local needs for access to adjacent lands, travel over relatively short distances, and connections to collectors or other higher systems. Local urban streets offer the lowest level of mobility and usually contain no bus routes. Service to through traffic movement is deliberately discouraged. Local streets usually account for 65 to 80 percent of the urban system.

E. Terrain. Terrain is a basis for further classification of geometric requirements.

1. Flat terrain is that condition where street sight distances, as governed by both horizontal and vertical restrictions, are generally long or could be made to be so without construction difficulty or major expense. The slope of the existing terrain is from zero percent to and including five percent.

2. Rolling terrain is that condition where the natural slopes rise above and fall below the street grade line consistently. Normal street alignment is restricted by occasional steep slopes. The slope of the existing terrain is from five percent to and including 15 percent.

3. Mountainous terrain is that condition where longitudinal and transverse changes in the elevation of the ground with respect to a street are abrupt and where the roadbed is obtained by frequent benching or side hill excavation. The slope of the existing terrain exceeds 15 percent.

Terrain classification pertains to the general character of the specific route corridor. Streets in valleys or passes of mountainous areas that have all the characteristics of streets traversing flat or rolling terrain should be classified as flat or rolling. In rolling terrain, trucks reduce their speeds below those of passenger cars on some sections of street. Mountainous terrain is responsible for some truck operation at crawl speeds. In cases where the terrain classification is in question, the city engineer shall make the final decision. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)

12.52.010 Scope.

The purpose of this chapter is to present criteria for the design of streets. It is to be used by developers and their engineers in the design of public and private streets for which approval by the city engineer is required. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.52.020 General requirements.

A. Minimum Standards. The provisions stipulated in this section are required minimum standards and shall be considered applicable to all parts of these specifications including any supplements and revisions. All construction within the public right-of-way shall be designed by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in the state of Washington. All drawings and support data submitted to the city for approval must bear his/her seal. The signature of the registered professional engineer will only be required on the approved final plans.

The design criteria, as presented, are intended to aid in preparation of plans and specifications and include minimum standards where applicable. These design criteria are considered minimum and a complete design will usually require more than is presented in this document. As with any design criteria, occasions may arise where the minimum standards are either inappropriate or cannot be justified economically and an equal but alternative solution may be proposed. A written request for each alternative shall be directed to the city engineer and shall conform to criteria in EWMC 12.50.100, Alternatives.

B. Application to Private Streets. Although community street requirements are usually best served by public streets owned and maintained by the city, private streets may be appropriate for some local access streets for either residential or commercial/industrial property. These standards apply to private streets as part of the city’s responsibility to ensure adequate access for normal and emergency vehicle use to individual parcels throughout the city.

Private streets are permitted only when all of the following conditions are met:

1. Permanently established by tract or easement providing legal access to each affected lot, dwelling unit, or business and sufficient to accommodate required improvements, to include provision for future use by adjacent property owners when applicable.

2. Constructed to East Wenatchee street standards as set forth herein.

3. Accessible at all times for emergency and public service vehicle use.

4. Not obstructing, or part of, the present or future public neighborhood circulation or arterial plan developed in processes such as the Greater East Wenatchee Area comprehensive plan, or capital improvement plan.

5. Designed for an average daily traffic count (AADT) of 160 or less vehicles per day utilizing current ITE guidelines. New private streets directly accessing a city street that will generate more than 160 AADT will be permitted only by approval of the hearing examiner and will be required to meet the appropriate city street standards contained herein (see Figures 3-7a through 3-8). There is no maximum AADT provision if a new development is served by an extension of, or spur off, an existing private street; however, should such existing private street be less than the standards considering the current and proposed AADT, the new development may be denied unless a lower level of improvement has been approved by the city hearing examiner upon recommendation by the city engineer or the applicant assumes responsibility for bringing the existing private street serving the new development up to these standards.

6. Maintained in accordance with these standards by a capable and legally responsible owner, homeowner’s association or other legal entity made up of all benefited property owners. A written street maintenance agreement addressing the rights and responsibilities of all benefited property owners shall be approved by the city prior to final approval of the land development. Said street maintenance agreement shall be recorded with the city and shall become a covenant with the affected properties. The term “benefited property owners” shall include the owners of record of all properties with frontage, including access rights, on the private street or otherwise have legal access, whether constructed or not, to the private street.

7. Clearly described as a private street not maintained by the city on the face of the plat, short plat or other development authorization.

8. Clearly signed at the street location as a private street. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.52.030 General design principles for new streets.

A. Street Network Circulation. The importance of good street network circulation for the health, welfare and safety of the public cannot be overemphasized. Poor circulation adds unnecessary miles to pedestrian and trail systems, school bus routes, mail delivery and other service deliveries, utility services and, most importantly, emergency services such as police and fire. Through good street network circulation, the public will have better emergency access and police and fire safety will be enhanced.

1. Plans will be reviewed for the provision of the best possible street and pedestrian network circulation and for conformance with any adopted comprehensive plan. The street alignment may necessitate realignment in order to foster the long-range transportation objectives of the city. This includes greater scrutiny to provide continuity of pedestrian and other trail systems related to the proposed street network. The inclusion of permanent cul-de-sacs is strongly discouraged as they inhibit street and pedestrian network circulation (see EWMC 12.52.040(L) for specific requirements) and are not consistent with the city comprehensive plan.

2. To facilitate the best possible street and pedestrian network circulation, if it is determined by the city engineer, after making an individualized determination, that the layout of streets is to provide for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining subdivisions, then the streets shall be constructed prior to final plat approval. When adjoining property is not subdivided, the city engineer shall determine whether streets in the proposed plat are to provide access to such unplatted property. The location for access to unplatted property shall be placed such that the objectives in these standards can be achieved. Reserve easement strips may be required to prevent unauthorized access until such time as the connecting streets are constructed.

3. If the streets are to remain private, the above still applies, except a separate tract or easement will be shown on the final plat map and they will not be dedicated to the public. Specific information in the recorded covenants regarding the use of this easement will be required.

4. Unless otherwise approved, all lots within major subdivisions shall be accessed by means of an internal street network. This network may be public or private but not a mixture of both. Access easements or multi-dwelling driveways in lieu of public or private streets shall not be permitted.

B. On-Site Principles. An integral part of an overall traffic study relates to basic site planning principles. An integrated on-site street system should deliver vehicles from the external street system in a manner easily understood by typical drivers and that maximizes efficiency, accommodates anticipated traffic patterns and ensures public safety.

1. Alignment. Connecting street centerlines deflecting from each other more than 10 degrees shall be connected by a curve the radius of which shall be approved by the city engineer. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is practicable, and street jogs having offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided.

2. Internal Vehicular Circulation. Internal circulation is the means by which vehicular traffic is delivered between entry points and parking areas, pick-up/drop-off points, and service areas, and should be planned to accommodate appropriate future traffic volumes.

3. Subdivision Boundary Streets. A street lying along the boundary of a subdivision may be dedicated with less than the width required by these standards if it is practicable to require the dedication of the remaining portion of such width when the adjoining property is subdivided. In such case there is required a reserve easement strip one foot wide along such street for the purpose of withholding access to the unsubdivided property from such street until a street is constructed to the full width required. The procedure shall also apply in the case of any street that dead-ends at the boundary of a subdivision.

4. Access Points. Streets and lots shall be laid out to provide individual lot access onto an internal street system, hence via the internal street system to the existing public street system. Direct access to a perimeter street shall normally be denied except for direct access onto a designated local access street.

5. Parking. Parking shall be provided to meet site-generated demands and be consistent with EWMC Title 17 and other planning department policies.

6. Vehicular Queuing and Storage.

a. Access drives should provide adequate vehicular exit queuing.

b. Parking areas and access points of small developments should be designed so vehicles waiting to exit are aligned perpendicular to the off-site street system.

c. Queuing areas of large developments should be sufficient so vehicles queued at exits do not block internal circulation. Exits shall be signalized if warranted by the MUTCD at build out.

d. Documentation shall be provided to verify queue lengths for signalized intersections, on-site queuing reservoirs, and off-site left and right-turn lanes.

7. Building Service Drives. Building service drives are streets adjacent to a building and its entrances, and should be designed with sufficient width to serve as one or all of the following:

a. Fire and/or emergency vehicle access.

b. Pedestrian pick-up/drop-off points. Pedestrian crossings and pick-up/drop-off points should be signed and striped to identify the vehicular/pedestrian conflict.

c. Internal circulation.

d. Recirculation in parking areas. Recirculation aisles shall have sufficient turning radii, clearances, sight distances and signing.

e. Transit passenger pick-up/drop off areas.

8. Pedestrian, Bus, Bicycle, and Disabled Access Facilities. The overall site plans must consider pedestrians, bus, bicycle, and disabled access facilities.

a. Pedestrian Facilities. Pedestrian connections between public transportation facilities and site buildings shall be integrated into the overall project design. Pedestrian facilities shall be designed to reduce the motor vehicle use for trips within the development and between nearby developments.

b. Transit Facilities. Appropriate public transportation facilities, such as passenger shelters, ride sharing areas and bus staging areas shall be accommodated adjacent to service drive and entrance areas; at key locations along circulation drives; and at major pedestrian focal points along the external street system as determined by the city and Link Transit.

c. Bicycle Facilities. Facilities for parking bicycles should be provided where bicycle use is expected. Refer to EWMC 17.72.020.

d. Disabled Access Facilities. Access for disabled persons shall be provided in accordance with federal, state and city requirements.

9. Service and Delivery Vehicles. Service and delivery vehicles require separate criteria for movement to and from the site:

a. Vehicle turning paths shall be sufficient to accommodate the largest vehicles anticipated, a minimum single unit truck (SU).

b. Service vehicle access points shall have turning paths sufficient to allow service vehicles to enter and exit the site without encroaching upon opposing lanes or curbed areas.

c. External and internal streets shall have sufficient separation for large vehicles to be queued on entry or exit without blocking access to parking spaces or internal streets.

C. Fitting the Street into the Environment. When land development requires the construction of new streets, there are opportunities to “fit” the street into the existing landscape and environment in ways that are more pleasing to the eye than just simple straight lines.

The principles set forth in this section stress the importance of protecting, conserving, and enhancing the scenic qualities of a city street. They are also consistent with good engineering and the necessity to provide a street which is safe to travel and economical to construct and maintain. Unless conditioned by “shall,” these principles are not regulatory but are advisory only to provide guidance to developers.

1. Relating Alignment to the Landscape. A unique visual quality of most city streets is the harmonious relationship their alignments have with the landscape. Increased volumes of traffic, poor sight distance, or other operational conditions may often necessitate modification of an existing alignment. If such a change is necessary, the street geometry usually must become more precise and directional. However, a new alignment should not be considered a straight line connecting two points. Rather, it should seek the same qualities of existing alignments by reinforcing and revealing the features of the landscape. The following guidelines will be useful for relating new alignments with the landscape:

a. Choose an alignment that blends with the terrain and adjusts to important scenic features.

b. In most instances, the appropriate alignment will be characterized by curves that continually adjust to the rolling topography of natural landform. A curvilinear alignment is visually and functionally preferable to long tangents that cut through hillsides, leaving steep unsightly and unstable embankments.

c. Where the land is level, or a strong lineal direction is created by landscape elements, such as a long row of trees or the patterns of fields, the use of a long tangent may be justified. When using a long tangent, try to direct it toward a natural or manmade focal point.

d. When climbing a hillside, the street should bend to the crest, traversing the contours, rather than climbing it straight on. However, care must be taken to avoid hiding a curve or driveway just beyond the brow of a hill.

e. When crossing a ridge, pick a saddle or low area in the top to locate the street.

f. Natural and manmade features provide variety and contrast which maintain the traveler’s interest. Whenever possible, alignments should be located to bring the more interesting features into view.

g. Near the edges of surface water, woods, or a break in topography, use alignments that echo or emphasize the shape of the edges. However, avoid moving streets close to the water’s edge as it destroys habitat.

h. When approaching important features, it is preferable to allow a distant view of the object, curve the alignment away, and then bring it close for a contrasting view.

A street which blends with the form and pattern of the landscape is also desirable from the standpoint of construction and maintenance. Some of the advantages to be gained are reduction of cut and fill quantities, more efficient utilization of natural drainage, and better control of roadside erosion because natural vegetation is preserved.

2. Combining Horizontal and Vertical Alignment. The combination of horizontal and vertical alignments closely influences the appearance and safety of a street. When alignments are properly coordinated, a street will be visually pleasing and safer to travel. Alignment coordination primarily applies to major streets, but the basic principles should also be recognized as important considerations when altering minor streets. Set forth below is a partial list of suggestions to guide the combination of horizontal and vertical alignments:

a. Consistency in the scale of horizontal and vertical elements should be maintained whenever possible. Small dips and humps should be avoided in what is actually a uniform grade, and “kinks” should be avoided in what is actually a long curve.

b. The beginning and ending of horizontal and vertical alignments should not occur in the same location. The beginning of a horizontal curve should generally occur before beginning a vertical curve and be somewhat longer in length. This provides a gradual transition between the alignments and prevents one from accentuating the other.

c. The beginning of a horizontal curve should not coincide with the top of a hill. This situation is visually deceptive and hazardous, as the quick change in horizontal alignment cannot be seen by the driver.

d. Avoid dips in vertical alignment before beginning a horizontal curve. This will prevent the street from appearing disjointed.

e. Avoid “broken back” curves (two horizontal curves in the same direction with a short tangent in-between), compound curves or reverse curves except for local access streets with a design speed of 25 MPH.

f. When an extremely long grade is necessary, it may be better to adjust the vertical alignment so the grade is steeper near the bottom of the hill and gradually lessens as it approaches the crest of the hill. Another alternative is to create an alignment with intervals of lesser grades.

g. Sight distance requirements vary with the anticipated speed of vehicles. Adequate sight distance must be provided. This should be checked at all horizontal curves and crest vertical curves.

3. Cross-Section. The small scale of cross-section elements is an important characteristic adding to the scenic quality of a city street. This aspect is most apparent in the width of the traveling surface, its adjacent shoulders, and the close proximity of the roadside. Where traffic volumes are low, speeds are slow, and meeting and passing of vehicles is infrequent, a narrow cross-section may be appropriate.

Modifications which require widening of the street will alter the existing scale of the city street and consequently its visual impact on the motorist and adjacent properties. The following considerations should guide the determination of an appropriate cross-section:

a. Appropriate widths should be determined by the function the street serves as part of the city street system, operational requirements for safe vehicular movement, and the characteristics of topography and other physical features (check results of planning considerations). In most cases, the minimum cross-section, based on location, functional class and traffic volume is shown in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010.

b. Consider all elements of the cross-section (traveling surface, shoulders, ditches, proper grading to stabilize cut and fill slopes, slope rounding, etc.).

4. Roadside Slopes. Proper molding of roadside slopes is essential during the grading operation. Slopes which do provide a smooth visual transition from the street to existing land forms have a pleasing appearance. Slopes shaped in this manner are also required for effective erosion control, adequate drainage, and reduced maintenance. Some general guidelines to follow when grading the roadside are set forth below:

a. Where the topography is flat to rolling and the landscape is open, slopes which are flattened and well-rounded are appropriate. Flattening of slopes to 4:1 (four horizontal to one vertical) should be carried out.

b. Where the topography is steep, uneven, and wooded, roadside slopes with grades of 2:1 or 3:1 should be favored to save roadside vegetation. However, check to make sure the slope is flat enough to be stable.

c. Vary the steepness of roadside slopes to save vegetation and other landscape features.

d. On areas of extreme cut, which may require easements or more right-of-way, the use of small benches, stepped down a steep slope, will slow water runoff and provide excellent locations where vegetation can quickly take hold. It is important to maintain a slight downhill pitch on these benches to provide adequate drainage.

e. On fill slopes of extreme length, larger benches can be formed to fulfill the same functions as above.

f. All slopes should be well-rounded to form a smooth transition from the shoulder edge to the existing grades. Deep ditches with well-defined bottoms are required where drainage or soils are poor. Rounded or shallow ditches are acceptable when there is little drainage and the soil is free draining.

g. All slopes should be warped by flattening the ends of cut and fill areas. This will avoid sharp breaks between new and existing grades and result in natural looking slopes that will more effectively support vegetation.

h. When grading the street, avoid disturbing important roadside vegetation and the creation of deep cuts that expose tree roots and leave steep banks that are susceptible to erosion and difficult to maintain.

5. Ditches. Ditches provide an important function in sustaining quality streets by providing adequate storm and subgrade groundwater drainage. Excessively deep or wide ditches can severely impact vegetation and the feel of a street or safety. Several issues to consider when selecting a ditch section follows:

a. Slopes from the street to the ditch bottom shall be at least 4:1 or greater. The shallower pitches will allow for some vehicle recovery and less potential of a vehicle overturning on higher speed streets.

b. Ditches must be deeper than the subgrade to allow drainage of street base and surfacing courses.

c. Where ditch construction may impact significant roadside features, short sections of culvert, curtain drains or shallow or no ditches at all should be considered, subject to approval by the city engineer.

d. Ditches must be constructed to adequately carry the anticipated water flow.

e. Biofiltration (or water quality) swales and grass buffer strips are encouraged at all locations where the street gradient makes them a practical alternative to regular street ditches. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.52.040 Design requirements – New and reconstructed streets.

The following minimum design standards shall apply to all new and reconstructed streets. Exhibits showing the basic cross-section requirements for the various street classifications are shown in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010.

A. Street Base and Surfacing Requirements. The following street surfacing requirements shall apply to all new and reconstructed streets.

1. Surfacing. The minimum street surfacing requirements for various traffic volumes and locations are shown in Table 12.52.040-1.

Table 12.52.040-1 Street Surfacing Requirements 

	Location	Figure	Traffic Volume (AADT)	Street Surface Type

	Urban – Private	3-7a, 3-7b, 3-8	All	ACP/HMA or PCC

	Urban – Public	3-7a, 3-7b, 3-8	All	ACP/HMA or PCC

2. Structural Sections – Public Streets.

a. Design Procedure. A street section structural design procedure shall be performed for all new and reconstructed public streets. The design life for all streets shall be 20 years with a growth factor as determined by the city engineer. The design procedure shall be approved by the city engineer and shall consider the following design elements:

i. Design load: HS 20-44.

ii. Total design life traffic loading: an estimate of the number and types of loadings the street will carry for the design life. This estimate of loading shall be determined using a procedure accepted by the city engineer and be expressed in 18-kip equivalent single axle loads (ESALs).

iii. Subgrade support: one or more representative values for the stiffness of the native material on which the street will be built. These values shall be established by a procedure accepted by the city engineer and be expressed as resilient modulus.

iv. Analysis: a procedure for establishing the street structural section for a given traffic loading and resilient modulus. This procedure shall be approved by the city engineer.

b. Construction Requirements. All structural sections including surfacing shall use materials meeting the specifications of and be constructed in accordance with the WSDOT Standard Specifications. Minimum compaction requirements shall be 91 percent for hot mix asphalt (asphalt concrete pavement) and 95 percent for crushed surfacing and base courses. See Chapter 12.56 EWMC for details and further guidance.

3. Structural Section – Private Streets. Private streets with a projected AADT under 160 do not require street section structural design; however, the requirement for minimum thickness will apply. Private streets with a projected AADT under 160 that are constructed without a street structural design will not be eligible for future inclusion into the city street system without further structural analysis as may be directed by the city engineer.

4. Minimum Thickness.

a. In all cases, the minimum street structural section shall be as shown on Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010.

b. Many areas of East Wenatchee have soils excessively susceptible to frost heave. The applicant or applicant’s engineer shall consult with the city engineer’s office as to those locations with known frost heave problems or with soils likely to generate excessive frost heave. These locations may require additional base thickness.

B. Design Speed. Design speeds for streets shall be as shown in Table 12.52.040-2:

Table 12.52.040-2 Design Speeds 

	Terrain – Design Speed in MPH

	Location/AADT	Figure	Flat	Rolling	Mountain

	Urban – Private1	3-7	25	25	20

	Urban – Local Access	3-7	25	25	25

	Urban – Collector	3-8	35	30	25

	Urban – Arterial	3-8	45	45	45

	1Private urban shall meet the urban local access standard.

See EWMC 12.51.020(E) for terrain definitions.

C. Right-of-Way. The basic minimum rights-of-way for all streets are shown in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010. Additional right-of-way shall be required to accommodate other street features such as additional lanes, planter strips and transit stops. Construction and maintenance easements may be allowed for cut and fill slopes.

D. Lane, Shoulder and Street Width. Basic lane, shoulder and total street and surfacing minimum width requirements are shown in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010. Minimum widths are based on a combination of street classification and traffic volume (AADT).

Urban street sections (Figures 3-7a and 3-7b in EWMC 12.60.010) assume parking on both sides. Applicants proposing utilization of no parking and parking one side alternates shall propose the alternate section to the city engineer for review in accordance with EWMC 12.50.100.

Urban collectors and arterial sections (Figure 3‑8 in EWMC 12.60.010) do not include provisions to accommodate parking.

Where truck traffic exceeds 15 percent of the projected AADT, 12-foot lanes will be required for all street classifications.

E. Ditch Slopes. The slope from edge of shoulder to bottom of ditch shall be 4:1 for all ditch street sections. See EWMC 12.57.020 for cut and fill slope requirements.

F. Sight Distance. All new streets shall be designed to achieve the following sight distances:

1. Stopping sight distance: AASHTO Green Book, current edition.

2. Intersection sight distance: WSDOT Design Manual M22-10, Chapter 910.10, “Intersections at Grade – Sight Distance at Intersections” or current edition.

3. Additionally, all arterials and collectors, with passing lanes, shall address passing sight distance: AASHTO Green Book, current edition.

G. Superelevation. Superelevation shall normally be applied to all new or reconstructed streets. The maximum superelevation for streets with a design speed of 35 MPH or greater shall not exceed six percent and for streets with a design speed under 35 MPH shall not exceed four percent; provided, however, that the combination of superelevation and street gradient shall not exceed 12 percent at any point on the street surface.

H. Horizontal Alignment (Curvature). The minimum curve radius for all new or reconstructed higher speed urban streets shall not be less than the rounded radius values in the AASHTO Green Book, current edition using a maximum superelevation rate of six percent for design speeds of 35 MPH or greater and a maximum superelevation rate of four percent for design speeds under 35 MPH.

Low speed urban streets (design speed of 30 MPH or less) may use the minimum curve radii as set forth in the AASHTO Green Book, current edition, based on a maximum superelevation rate of four percent. Lesser curve radii may be used only with the permission of the city engineer.

I. Vertical Alignment.

1. Maximum Grades. The maximum and minimum grades for each street classification are shown in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010.

a. Vertical curves.

b. Sag vertical curves shall be designed in accordance with the AASHTO Green Book, “Design Controls for Sag Vertical Curves – Open Street Conditions,” and “Design Controls for Sag Vertical Curves.”

c. Crest vertical curves shall be designed in accordance with the AASHTO Green Book, “Design Controls for Crest Vertical Curves – Open Street Conditions,” “Design Controls for Stopping Sight Distance and for Crest Vertical Curves,” and “Design Controls for Crest Vertical Curves Based on Passing Sight Distance.”

J. Vertical Clearance. The minimum vertical clearance for all streets under structures such as overpasses shall be 16.5 feet.

K. Design Vehicle. The physical characteristics of vehicles and the proportions of various sized vehicles using the street system are positive controls in geometric design. For street design purposes, three general classes of vehicles have been selected – passenger cars, trucks and buses/recreational vehicles. The passenger car class includes compacts and subcompacts plus all light vehicles and light delivery trucks (vans and pickups). The truck class includes single-unit trucks, truck tractor-semitrailer combinations, and trucks or truck tractors with semitrailers in combination with full trailers. Buses/recreational vehicles include single-unit buses, articulated buses, school buses, motor homes, and passenger cars or motor homes pulling trailers or boats. In addition, where provision is made for bicycles on a street, the bicycle should also be considered a design vehicle.

The dimensions for the 15 design vehicles representing vehicles within these general classes are provided in the AASHTO Green Book. In the design of any street facility, the largest design vehicle likely to use that facility with considerable frequency or a design vehicle with special characteristics that must be taken into account in dimensioning the facility is used to determine the design of such critical features as radii at intersections and radii of turning streets.

Unless unusual sized vehicles must be accommodated, the typical design vehicle used for design of streets shall be of the following classes:

L. Cul-De-Sacs and Dead-End Streets.

1. Permanent cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets are not normally permitted within new developments. Permanent cul-de-sacs will only be permitted where the applicant can:

a. Demonstrate that his/her design does provide an acceptable level of network circulation considering the terrain and adjacent existing street network; and

b. Demonstrate that the prohibition of cul-de-sacs will place an unreasonable economic impact on the applicant.

2. Where a permanent cul-de-sac or dead-end street is permitted in accordance with the provisions noted above, the following requirements shall apply:

a. Permanent street ends of 150 feet or less in length (measured from the edge of traveled way of the intersecting street to the end of the street) shall have a minimum right-of-way and street section as specified in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010 and do not require an access easement turnaround.

b. Permanent street ends between 150 and 600 (measured from the edge of traveled way of the intersecting street to the beginning of the cul-de-sac) shall have a minimum right-of-way and street section as specified in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010 and be provided with a cul-de-sac as shown in Figure 3-9 in EWMC 12.60.010.

c. Permanent street ends in excess of 600 feet are discouraged but may be allowed in cases where lots are large and/or difficult terrain exists, provided the number of single-family lots served by the street does not exceed 20 or the projected AADT generated from the properties served by the street does not exceed 200. The street shall have a minimum right-of-way and street section as specified in Figures 3-7a through 3-8 in EWMC 12.60.010 and be provided with a cul-de-sac as shown in Figure 3-9 in EWMC 12.60.010.

d. The maximum gradient in any direction and at any point within a cul-de-sac shall not exceed four percent.

M. Intersections. All intersections shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 9, “Intersections,” in the AASHTO Green Book or Chapter 910, “Intersections at Grade,” in the current edition of the WSDOT Design Manual M22-01, which requires plus four percent for 50 feet. All intersections with a state highway shall require approval from the WSDOT.

Corner lots, located at street intersections, shall be rounded with a minimum 20-foot radius adjacent to streets with 60-foot or more rights-of-way and 25-foot radius adjacent to streets with less than 60-foot rights-of-way.

N. Boundary (Half) Streets. Boundary or half streets may be permitted to be dedicated with less than the width required by these standards if the city determines that it is practicable to require the remaining portion of such width when the adjoining property is subdivided. Boundary or half streets with widths less than those required by these standards are not allowed adjacent to public parkland or properties owned by public school districts.

O. Transit Stops and Pull-Outs. Property owners and/or developers of proposed developments or other types of land uses located within the Link Transit service area and which generate 200 average daily or 20-peak-hour vehicle trips, as determined by the city engineer, shall negotiate with the public transit authority the improvements that would enhance the area for public transit. Improvements may include bus shelters, pull-outs, transit stops, and/or other necessary facilities to offset transportation system impacts of the development and shall be analyzed as part of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with Chapter 12.59 EWMC.

P. Curb and Gutter.

1. Cement concrete curb and gutter shall be utilized for street edges under the following conditions.

a. In areas where urban street standards are to be used.

b. On frontages with commercial usage.

2. Rolled edge, thickened edge or mountable curbs are not permitted as a substitute for curbs and gutters except on private streets and may only be used when approved by the city engineer.

3. On all sections constructed with curb and gutter a closed drainage system consisting of catch basins, storm sewer pipes and manholes shall be required unless alternative and appropriately designed methods of collecting and dispersing storm water such as bioinfiltration swales and drywells are provided.

4. Curb and gutter shall be constructed in accordance with WSDOT Standard Plans.

Q. Sidewalks.

1. Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of all arterials, collectors, local access streets and commercial streets in the city. Sidewalks shall be required on only one side of the street on all perimeter arterial and major and minor collectors or half streets of a development being constructed under urban standards.

2. Alternatives to requirements noted above for sidewalks on all streets may be approved under the provisions of EWMC 12.50.100. Typical conditions that may warrant approval of an alternative or waiver of the requirements include existing streets where it would be unduly difficult or impractical to construct sidewalks due to grade or steep slope problems or in developments where the basic design allows for an off-street walkway system; provided, that said walkway is an improved surface and provision for maintenance is guaranteed.

3. Sidewalks shall be constructed with portland cement concrete. Sidewalks shall be at least five feet in width and four inches in thickness for urban local access streets. Urban collector and urban arterial sidewalks shall be at least six feet in width. When adjacent to school property and in commercial areas, the sidewalks shall be at least eight feet in width. Sidewalk configurations shall be in accordance with the WSDOT Design Manual and the WSDOT Standard Plans except for sidewalk width. All sidewalk ramps and features shall be ADA compliant. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.52.050 Storm water management.

A. All project submittals shall be in compliance with the provisions of EWMC Title 13, Surface and Storm Water Management. In addition, all drainage facilities within current or future city right-of-way must be of the type and nature that can be easily maintained by the city. This typically includes as a minimum 12-inch diameter storm sewer pipe and standard catch basins and manholes for curb and gutter street sections. All other facilities such as French drains, curtain drains, drywells and storm water detention ponds shall be installed outside the city’s right-of-way and be maintained by the applicant or homeowner’s association. See also EWMC 12.55.050(J), Standard Plan Notes, for catch basin and grate requirements.

B. All cross culverts and ditch channelizations shall be first evaluated for the presence of fish and, should it be determined by the city that the culvert or channelization be designed to accommodate fish passage including stream bed and/or stream bank enhancement, the culvert or channelization shall be constructed to meet current Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife standards.

C. Storm water facilities shall also be designed to accommodate the storm water from the addition of frontage improvements including tributary area. In locations where future development is expected at a higher elevation and adjacent to the proposed development, the storm sewer pipe shall be extended and deadheaded at the development property line to ease future system connection.

D. Projects requesting storm water management fee credit from the city for the storm water facilities as provided for in Chapter 13.10 EWMC, Surface and Storm Water Management Utility Code, shall be required to provide the city with a project engineer’s certification of the facilities prior to release of the financial security. The financial security shall not be released until all facilities are completed and repaired as per the approved plans.

E. The maximum spacing on surface drainage courses between inlets or catch basins shall normally be 150 feet on street grades less than one percent and 200 feet on grades from one percent to three percent. When the street grade is greater than three percent, the maximum spacing shall be 300 feet. Additional catch basins may be required to confine drainage to the gutter and prevent street drainage from sheet flowing across streets or intersections. The applicant shall locate any additional catch basins or make other drainage system improvements to ensure that any street drainage does not encroach more than one-half the traveled way lane width nor exceed one-half the curb height during a rainfall design event of two inches in 90 minutes. Maximum spacing on main storm sewers between access structures, whether catch basins or manholes, shall be 300 feet.

F. All materials used shall conform to the requirements of the standard specifications. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.52.060 New utilities.

A. Location of Utilities – Underground.

1. Underground utilities to be installed within the right-of-way on new streets (or on streets where existing topography, utilities or storm drains are not in conflict) shall be located as shown in Figures 3-10 and 3-11 in EWMC 12.60.010. Where existing utilities or storm drains are in place, new utilities shall conform to these standards as nearly as practicable and yet be compatible with the existing installations. Utilities to be installed outside the street right-of-way shall be installed within a designated utility easement and shall meet the installation requirements of the utility.

2. Gravity systems, whether sanitary or storm drainage, shall have precedence over other systems in planning and installation except where a nongravity system has already been installed under previous approved permit and subject to applicable provisions of such permits or franchises.

3. Individual water service lines shall:

a. Be placed with minimum 36-inch cover from finished grade, ditch bottom or natural ground.

b. Use street right-of-way only as necessary to make side connections.

c. For any one connection, not extend more than 60 feet along or through the right-of-way, or the minimum width of the existing right-of-way.

d. Water meter boxes, when placed or re-placed, shall be located on the right-of-way line immediately adjacent to the property being served, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Meter box locations within the right-of-way may be approved by the city engineer based on site conditions that make routine service access difficult or impractical.

4. Sanitary Sewers.

a. In the case of individual sanitary sewer service lines which are force mains, the pipe shall:

i. Be minimum two inches I.D., or as required by the utility to maintain internal scouring velocity.

ii. If nonmetallic, contain wire or other acceptable proximity detection features; or be placed in a cast iron or other acceptable metal casing.

iii. Be placed with minimum three-foot cover from finished grade, ditch bottom or natural ground, within 10 degrees of perpendicular to street centerline, and extend to right-of-way line.

b. Sanitary and water lines shall be separated in accordance with good engineering practice such as the Criteria for Sewage Work Design, Washington Department of Ecology, latest edition.

5. Service Connections – All. Mains and service connections to all lots shall be completed prior to placing of surface materials.

6. Materials and Installation – All. All underground utilities shall utilize materials and be installed in conformance with the requirements of the particular utility standards.

B. Location of Utilities – Above Ground.

1. All poles, transformer cases, and other above ground utility appurtenances shall be located to avoid becoming a streetside obstacle. See EWMC 12.57.080 for further guidance.

2. Above ground utilities located within intersections shall be placed so as to avoid conflict with placement of curb ramps. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


12.52.070 Connections to existing utilities.

Typically, new utility installations, both underground and overhead, constructed in conjunction with land development require a connection to existing utilities. Where such connections must utilize existing city right-of-way, the connection must be performed in accordance with Chapters 12.04 and 12.16 EWMC. (Ord. 10-09 § 9 (Exh. B), 2010)


Chapter 12.53 DRIVEWAYS, ACCESS EASEMENT, PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES, WALKS AND TRAILS

Sections:

12.53.010    Driveways and access easement.

12.53.020    Pedestrian facilities (urban areas).

12.53.030    Walkways, bikeways and trails.

12.53.040    School access.

12.53.050    Alleys.


12.53.010 Driveways and access easement.

A. General.

1. Dimensions, slopes and details for all driveway and access easements connecting to a city street shall be as indicated on Figure 4-1 in EWMC 12.60.010. Driveways entering streets with curb and gutter shall meet the requirements contained within WSDOT Standard Plans as approved by the city engineer.

2. All new or revised driveways and accesses onto a city street (including temporary or construction accesses) require approval from the city engineer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

B. Conditions for Approval of New Driveways and Access Easements.

1. Driveways directly providing access onto arterials and collectors shall be denied if alternate access is available. Access onto arterials and collectors may be permitted where no other alternative is available and is approved by the city engineer.

2. Where property has frontage on more than one street, driveways and accesses shall be limited to the lowest volume street.

3. Circular driveways shall have a minimum separation of 100 feet.

4. Driveways and access easements should be located at the greatest distance possible from an intersection of two streets. Driveways and access easements should not be located closer than 125 feet from the nearest edge of the intersection as measured from the closest point of the driveway edge when either intersecting street is an arterial or collector and 75 feet when the streets are both local access streets. The city engineer may issue a permit for a driveway or access easement not meeting city location and spacing criteria standards if a conforming connection is not attainable at the time of the permit application submittal and denial would leave the property without a reasonable means of connection to the street system. The city engineer may require the applicant to provide a traffic impact analysis to support the request for a nonconforming driveway or access easement. Nonconforming driveway or access easement permits shall specify conditions or limits including, but not limited to, the following:

a. Joint Use Connection. The city may issue a driveway or access easement connection permit requiring a legally enforceable joint use driveway when determined by the city engineer to be in the best interest of the city in maintaining the operational efficiency and safety of the street.

b. Traffic Volume. The maximum vehicular usage of the connection shall be specified in the permit.

c. Future Alternate Access. The permit shall specify that a conforming connection be constructed if and when future alternate means of access becomes available, and that the nonconforming connection must be removed.

d. Users. The permit shall specify the properties to be served by the connection; and any other conditions as necessary to ensure the safe operation of the driveway or access easement and the intersecting street.

5. In areas zoned residential, the minimum separation of individual parcel driveways or accesses, as measured from the centerlines of the driveways or accesses, shall not exceed one-half of the sum of the accessed parcel frontage and each of the adjacent parcel frontages. Joint usage driveways may be required where sufficient spacing is not available.

6. Only one driveway per single residential or commercial unit will be permitted unless the applicant can demonstrate that additional driveways or accesses are needed due to the amount of traffic generated by the project, traffic distribution patterns, impacts to the city street system or public safety and there is sufficient space to accommodate the additional driveway or access. Joint usage driveways are encouraged.

7. All abandoned driveways shall be removed and restored by the applicant or agent.

8. Maintenance of driveways and approaches (and associated culverts where required) onto a city street shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

C. Standards.

1. Common to All Driveways and Access Easements.

a. Clear View Triangle. In addition to providing sufficient sight distances as required in subsection (C)(1)(c) of this section, a clear view triangle as described in Chapter 10.28 EWMC shall be maintained for vision safety purposes.

b. Alignment. All driveways and access easement shall intersect the main street at an angle between 75 and 105 degrees, with 90 degrees being preferable.

c. Sight Distance. Sufficient sight distances for vehicles to safely enter onto a public street or streets as well as for other vehicles on the street or streets to avoid accidents with entering or exiting vehicles is required for all driveways and access points. For all driveways and access easement, stopping sight distance in accordance with the AASHTO Green Book is required as follows:

To calculate sight distance for existing streets serving a proposed driveway or access, first convert the posted speed to an operating speed as per Table 12.53.010-1:

Table 12.53.010-1 

	Posted Speed	Add for Operating Speed

	20 mph	0

	25 mph	0

	30 mph	5 mph

	35 mph	5 mph

	40 mph	10 mph

	45 mph and above	10 mph

Secondly, use the operating speed and determine the minimum stopping sight distances from Table 12.53.010-2 (based on an approaching vehicle driver’s eye height of three and one-half feet and an object at the driveway of two feet).

Table 12.53.010-2

	Operating Speed (mph)	Minimum Stopping Sight Distance (feet)

	20	115

	25	155

	30	200

	35	250

	40	305

	45	360

	50	425

	55	495

	60	570

The grade of the street can also affect the minimum sight distance required. The following Table 12.53.010-3 provides the increase for downgrades and the decrease for upgrades modifiers.

Table 12.53.010-3

	Operating Speed (mph)	Increase (feet) for Downgrades	Decrease (feet) for Upgrades

	3%	6%	9%	3%	6%	9%

	20 to 30	10	20	30	—	10	20

	31 to 40	20	40	70	10	20	30

	41 to 50	30	70	—	20	30	—

	51 to 60	50	110	—	30	50	—

Situations with sight distances less than the above must be approved by the city engineer. In these cases, the applicant may also be required to obtain the services of a professional traffic engineer to assess the situation and provide written justification for lesser sight distances.

Sight distances shall be measured from a point 10 feet back of the edge of shoulder or back of sidewalk each way along the edge of the traveled way of the main street as shown in the figure below.

That portion of a driveway or access easement connecting to a paved public street that is within the right-of-way of the public street shall be surfaced with a minimum of two and one-half inches of compacted asphalt concrete pavement or equivalent surfacing material to the street.

f. Maintenance. Maintenance of all driveways and access easement including approaches to public streets shall be the responsibility of the owner(s). All shared driveways and access easements shall have a maintenance agreement recorded with the final project approval that specifies consistent maintenance in accordance with the approved project plans.

2. Driveways and Joint Usage Driveways. Driveways and joint usage driveways serving no more than two lots have no minimum width or surfacing requirements beyond requirements of subsection (C)(1) of this section. The minimum width of a driveway or a joint usage driveway is 20 feet.

a. Driveways providing access to one single-family home should have a maximum improved width of 20 feet and a minimum improved width of 10 feet.

b. Joint use driveways should have a minimum improved width of 15 feet and a maximum improved width of 30 feet. The width of the easement shall be sufficient to accommodate the driveway surfacing, any required storm water drainage features, and any utilities. In no case shall the easement be less than 30 feet in width. The full width of the easement shall be clear of sight obstructions to a height of 13 feet six inches. The maximum grade shall be 12 percent.

c. All driveways shall be improved with a minimum of six inches of compacted gravel base, crushed surfacing base course or crushed surfacing top course. The surfacing shall be concrete, asphalt or an alternative treatment providing surfacing capable of supporting a typical residential vehicle load. The use of pervious surfacing is encouraged.

d. All driveways greater than 150 feet in length shall be improved with an approved turnaround for emergency vehicles such as a cul-de-sac or hammerhead unless the fire marshal determines that alternative access for fire protection is available. See Figure 4-2 in EWMC 12.60.010 for acceptable turnaround designs.

3. Access Easements. Property accesses serving no more than four lots are access easements. Unless an alternate approved emergency vehicle access is provided, access easements shall also serve as an emergency vehicle access. Access easements are privately owned and maintained by the property owners being served and are not the responsibility of the city. Access easements shall comply with EWMC 15.16.010 and have the following minimum requirements:

a. The minimum width of the tract or easement for an access easement shall be 30 feet.

b. The minimum base shall be six inches of compacted gravel base, crushed surfacing base course or crushed surfacing top course. The surfacing shall be concrete, asphalt, or other approved surfacing capable of supporting the imposed load of fire apparatus weighing at least 75,000 pounds.

c. The base and surfacing shall provide a minimum unobstructed width of 20 feet. Where a fire hydrant is located on an access easement, the minimum unobstructed surface width shall be 26 feet.

d. Suitable drainage in the form of ditches and cross culverts shall be provided along the full length of the access easement. Any bridges or drainage structures shall meet the requirements of Chapter 12.55 EWMC.

e. All dead end access easements greater than 150 feet in length shall be improved with an approved turnaround for emergency vehicles such as a cul-de-sac or hammerhead. See Figure 4-2 in EWMC 12.60.010 for acceptable turnaround designs. The length of an access easement shall not exceed 450 feet, excluding the turnaround unless otherwise approved by the city fire marshal.

f. Access easement to more than four lots shall be via an urban local access city or private street meeting the requirements of this chapter.

Chapters:

13.05    Definitions

13.10    Surface and Storm Water Management Utility Code

13.20    Storm Water Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination

13.30    Construction and Post-Construction Storm Water


Chapter 13.05 DEFINITIONS

Sections:

13.05.010    Purpose and applicability.

13.05.020    Definitions.


13.05.010 Purpose and applicability.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a primary source for the definition of terms used in EWMC Titles 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18. The definitions herein are applicable to those titles within the context of their use. These definitions do not supersede or replace the definitions of other terms found in the enumerated titles. (Ord. 10-05 § 3 (App. A), 2010; Ord. 09-14 § 4 (App. A), 2009)


13.05.020 Definitions.

A. “A” Definitions.

1. “All known, available, and reasonable” (“AKART”) means methods of prevention, control, and treatment, the most current methodology that can be reasonably required for preventing, controlling, or abating the pollutants associated with a discharge. The concept of AKART applies to both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. Best management practices (BMPs) typically applied to nonpoint source pollution controls are considered a subset of the AKART requirement. The Stormwater Management Manual for Eastern Washington may be used as a guideline, to the extent appropriate, for developing best management practices to apply AKART for storm water discharges. “AKART” and “best available treatment (BAT)” are roughly equivalent state and federal terms for the same concept.

B. “B” Definitions.

1. “Best management practices (BMPs)” means schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general good housekeeping practices, maintenance procedures, and structural and/or managerial practices approved by the city that, when used singly or in combination, prevent or reduce the release of pollutants directly or indirectly to storm water, receiving waters or storm water conveyance systems.

C. “C” Definitions.

1. “Certified erosion and sediment control lead (CESCL)” means an individual who is knowledgeable in the principles and practices of erosion and sediment control. The CESCL shall have the skills to assess: the site conditions and construction activities that could impact the quality of storm water; and the effectiveness of erosion and sediment control measures used to control the quality of storm water discharges. The CESCL shall have current certification through an approved erosion and sediment control training program that meets the minimum training standards established by Ecology.

2. “City” means the city of East Wenatchee, Washington, a municipal corporation of the state of Washington, acting by and through its city council, unless such authority shall be delegated to other persons.

3. “Clean Water Act” means the federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), and any subsequent amendments thereto.

4. “Common plan of development or sale” means a site where multiple separate and distinct construction activities may be taking place at different times on different schedules, but still under a single plan. Examples include: phased projects and projects with multiple filings or lots, even if the separate phases or filings/lots will be constructed under separate contract or by separate owners (e.g., a development where lots are sold to separate builders); a development plan that may be phased over multiple years, but is still under a consistent plan of long-term development; and projects in a contiguous area that may be unrelated but still under the same contract, such as construction of a building extension and new parking lot at the same facility. If the project is part of a common plan of development or sale, the disturbed area of the entire plan shall be used in determining permit requirements.

5. “Construction activity” means activities subject to NPDES construction permits. These include construction projects resulting in land disturbance of one acre or more and projects less than one acre that have the potential to discharge runoff to the county’s storm drain system. Such activities include but are not limited to clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating, and demolition.

D. “D” Definitions.

h. Springs;

i. Uncontaminated water from crawl space pumps;

j. Footing drains;

k. Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;

l. Emergency firefighting activities but not from activities not related to firefighting such as the maintenance or cleaning of firefighting equipment.

2. The prohibitions in this chapter shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Washington State Department of Ecology; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit and other applicable laws and regulations; and provided, that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system by the city.

3. The following non-storm water discharges shall not be considered illegal discharges for the purposes of this chapter if they meet the stated conditions, or unless the director determines that the type of discharge, whether singly or in combination with others, is causing or is likely to cause pollution of surface water or groundwater:

a. Discharges from potable water sources, including water line flushing, hyperchlorinated water line flushing, fire hydrant system flushing, and pipeline hydrostatic test water. Planned discharges shall be dechlorinated to a concentration of 0.1 ppm or less, pH adjusted if necessary, and volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent resuspension of sediments in the MS4;

b. Discharges from lawn watering and other irrigation runoff shall be kept to a minimum and shall not cause damage to public streets or sidewalks;

c. Swimming pool, hot tub, and spa discharges shall be dechlorinated to a total residual chlorine concentration of 0.1 ppm or less, pH adjusted and reoxygenated if necessary, and volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent resuspension of sediments in the MS4. Discharges shall be thermally controlled to prevent an increase in temperature of the receiving water. Swimming pool cleaning wastewater and filter backwash are prohibited from discharge to the MS4;

d. Street and sidewalk wash water, water used to control dust, and routine external building wash down shall not contain soaps or detergents and shall be kept to a minimum. Practices shall be implemented prior to washing to reduce pollutants entering the MS4 including but not limited to sweeping, picking up litter and controlling velocity of discharge.

e. Other non-storm water discharges shall be in compliance with the requirements of a storm water pollution prevention plan reviewed by the city which addresses control of such discharges.

4. The non-storm water discharges from the sources listed above shall be considered illicit discharges if the director determines that the type of discharge, whether singly or in combination with others, is causing or contributing to a violation of the city’s NPDES storm water permit or is causing or contributing to a water quality problem, such as those which contain more contamination than typical discharges in the city, or which contain a type of contamination that is more toxic or is otherwise a more serious problem than typical discharges in the city.

B. Prohibition of Illicit Connections.

1. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.

2. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.

3. A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.

4. Improper connections in violation of this chapter must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved on-site wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the city.

C. Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the city requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the city. (Ord. 19-09 § 5, 2019; Ord. 09-14 § 5 (App. B), 2009)

2. The director shall have the right to set up on any premises such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of discharges from the site.

3. The director has the right to require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner or operator. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure accuracy.

4. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the premises shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner of the premises.

B. Search Warrants. If the director has been refused access to any part of the premises from which a discharge has occurred or is likely to occur, and the director is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 09-14 § 5 (App. B), 2009)


13.20.060 Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollutants by the use of best management practices.

The owner or operator of such activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water or the storm drainage system shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. (Ord. 09-14 § 5 (App. B), 2009)


13.20.070 Spills.

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the city’s public works department in person or by phone, email or facsimile. (Ord. 09-14 § 5 (App. B), 2009)


13.20.080 Violations, enforcement, and penalties.

D. Suspension of MS4 Access.

1. Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:

a. Immediately comply with all chapter requirements; and

b. Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility’s water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.

2. Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.

3. Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city. (Ord. 09-14 § 5 (App. B), 2009)


13.20.090 Cost of abatement of the violation.

The owner of the property or person responsible for the violation will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. Payment in full shall be due within 30 days and on the thirty-first day interest may be applied at a rate of eight percent per annum. After 90 days, if payment in full has not been received, a lien may be filed on the property and foreclosed as provided in Chapter 35.67 RCW. The director may approve a payment plan of equal payments evenly spaced over no more than 12 months. (Ord. 09-14 § 5 (App. B), 2009)

13.30.140 Violations, enforcement and penalties.

A. It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this chapter. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the requirements of this chapter may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the city may enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The city is authorized to seek costs of the abatement in accordance with EWMC 8.20.120.

In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this chapter, the city may impose alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, cleanup, or other alternative actions deemed appropriate by the city.

D. Suspension of MS4 Access.

1. Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator directing the violator to immediately cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:

a. Immediately comply with all chapter requirements; and

b. Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge;

c. Any person notified of an emergency order under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate the endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility’s water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 

2. Suspension in Emergency Situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.

3. Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the city.

E. Cost of Abatement of the Violation. The owner of the property or person responsible for the violation will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. Payment in full shall be due within 30 days and on the thirty-first day interest may be applied at a rate of eight percent per annum. After 90 days, if payment in full has not been received, a lien may be filed on the property and foreclosed as provided in Chapter 35.67 RCW. The director may approve a payment plan of equal payments evenly spaced over no more than 12 months.

F. Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative remedies. The city may recover all attorneys’ fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter, including but not limited to sampling and monitoring expenses.

15.44.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of East Wenatchee are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 § 1.2, 1979)


15.44.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and surrounding area. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 § 1.3, 1979)


15.44.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to general public health and safety due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 § 1.4, 1979)

B. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided (in A zones) in accordance with EWMC 15.44.350, Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer EWMC 15.44.500, Specific standards, and EWMC 15.44.560, Floodways.

C. Information to Be Obtained and Maintained.

1. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or required as in subsection B of this section, obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement; recorded on a current elevation certificate (FF 81-31).

2. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in subsection B of this section:

a. Obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed;

b. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in EWMC 15.44.400(B)(3).

3. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

D. Alteration of Watercourses.

1. Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.

2. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

E. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of the Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 4, 1987; Ord. 280 § 4.3, 1979. Formerly 15.44.330)


15.44.430 Variances procedure.

A. Appeal Board.

1. The board of adjustment, as established by the city council, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

2. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

3. Those aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment, or any taxpayer directly affected by the decision, may appeal such decision to the Douglas County superior court, as provided in RCW 35A.63.110.

4. In passing upon such applications, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

f. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

h. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

5. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (A)(4) of this section and the purpose of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

6. The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.

B. Criteria.

1. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

2. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

3. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

4. Variances shall only be issued upon:

a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

5. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from flood elevations should be quite rare.

6. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (B)(1) of this section, and otherwise complies with EWMC 15.44.450, 15.44.470 and 15.44.480.

7. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk.

C. Application Procedure.

1. Any person holding an equitable interest in any tract of land affected by this chapter may apply for a variance. Decisions of the administrator in the enforcement of this chapter may also be appealed by the same method by any aggrieved party.

2. Application for a variance or appeal of an administrative determination shall be processed pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, Chapter 17.88 EWMC and EWMC Title 19 as the same now exist or may be hereafter amended. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 §§ 4.4-1, 4.4-2, 4.4-3, 1979. Formerly 15.44.340, 15.44.350 and 15.44.360)

Article V. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction


15.44.440 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 § 5.1, 1979. Formerly 15.44.370)


15.44.450 Anchoring.

A. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

B. All manufactured homes and mobile homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. For more detailed information, refer to guidebook, FEMA-85, “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas.” (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 5, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.1-1, 1979. Formerly 15.44.380)


15.44.460 Construction materials and methods.

A. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

B. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

C. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Locating such equipment below the base flood elevation may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be increased. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 6, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.1-2, 1979. Formerly 15.44.390)


15.44.470 Utilities.

A. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;

B. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway;

C. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;

D. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 § 5.1-3, 1979. Formerly 15.44.400)


15.44.480 Subdivision proposals.

A. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

B. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;

C. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage;

D. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less). (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 7, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.1-4, 1979. Formerly 15.44.410)


15.44.490 Review of building permits.

Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source (EWMC 15.44.420(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 8, 1987; Ord. 180 § 5.1-5, 1979. Formerly 15.44.420)


15.44.500 Specific standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in EWMC 15.44.350, Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, or EWMC 15.44.420(B), Use of Other Base Flood Data. FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01 including all of its provisions may be utilized to allow crawlspace construction for buildings located in the special flood hazard areas; however, use of this provision can result in a 20 percent increase in flood insurance premiums. The provisions in the remaining sections of this article are required. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 280 § 5.2, 1979. Formerly 15.44.430)


15.44.510 Residential construction.

A. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation (BFE).

B. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

1. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

C. Crawlspaces are commonly used as a method of elevating buildings in SFHAs above the BFE. General NFIP requirements that apply to all crawlspaces that have enclosed areas or floors below the BFE include the following:

1. The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through the required openings discussed below. Because of hydrostatic loads, crawlspace construction is not recommended in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer.

2. The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. (For guidance on flood openings, see Technical Bulletin 1-93, Openings in Foundation Walls.)

3. Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE. The recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above the BFE.

D. Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork in particular must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.

E. In addition to the above requirements the following provisions apply to below-grade crawlspaces:

1. The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG).

2. The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall, must not exceed four feet at any point.

3. There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity of mechanical means.

4. The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace.

5. Below-grade crawlspace construction in accordance with the requirements listed above and FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01 will not be considered basements. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 8, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.2-1, 1979. Formerly 15.44.440)


15.44.520 Nonresidential construction.

New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

A. Be floodproofed so that below one foot or more above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

B. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

C. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this section based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in EWMC 15.44.420(C)(2)(b);

D. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in EWMC 15.44.510(B). (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 8, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.2-2, 1979. Formerly 15.44.450)


15.44.530 Manufactured homes.

All manufactured and mobile homes in the floodplain to be placed or substantially improved on sites shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 8, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.2-3, 1979. Formerly 15.44.460)


15.44.540 Recreational vehicles.

Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

A. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

B. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

C. Meet the requirements of EWMC 15.44.530 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005)


15.44.550 AE and A1-30 zones with base flood elevations but no floodways.

In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005)


15.44.560 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in EWMC 15.44.350 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that can carry debris and increase erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for (1) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and (2) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the repair or reconstruction is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded in the 50 percent.

C. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V of this chapter, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005; Ord. 421 § 9, 1987; Ord. 280 § 5.3, 1979. Formerly 15.44.470)


15.44.570 Critical facility.

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above the BFE or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 05-04 § 1, 2005)

(Ord. 10-09 § 5, 2010; Ord. 431 § 1, 1987)


15.48.110 Modifications, deferments and waivers – Generally.

The city council may grant a request for modification, deferment or waiver as defined in EWMC 15.48.120 through 15.48.160 under the conditions set forth in those sections. If the proposed development of the subject property requires approval of the city council, a request for modification, deferment or waiver will be considered as part of that process. In all other cases, the request for modification, deferment or waiver shall be made in writing to the city council, and the city council, at their next regular meeting, shall set a hearing date to consider the request no more than 30 days following the date of the regular meeting of the city council when the hearing date is set. Modifications, deferments or waivers granted are binding on the applicant, future owners of the subject premises, and the city for all building permits issued for the subject premises for the following three years. The city council shall prepare written findings and decisions resulting from any hearings held in accordance with this chapter. Also see EWMC 12.50.150(D). (Ord. 10-09 § 5, 2010; Ord. 431 § 1, 1987)


15.48.120 Modifications – Criteria.

The city may grant a modification to the nature or extent of any required improvement as provided for in EWMC 12.50.100. (Ord. 10-09 § 5, 2010; Ord. 431 § 1, 1987)


15.48.130 Deferment – Criteria.

The city may grant a deferment for the implementation of the required improvements at a later time for any of the following reasons:

A. If the installation of the required improvements at the present time would create a serious safety hazard because compatible improvements have not yet been installed in the right-of-way fronting the neighboring property;

B. If the proper vertical or horizontal alignment for the required improvements cannot be determined because the streets from which the alignment must be determined do not have the correct alignments;

C. If constructing the required improvements in the proper vertical and horizontal alignment will cause the new improvements to function improperly or unsafely with existing connecting improvements; provided, that when the proper alignment can be determined but has not been, and the proposed development contains five or more dwelling units or 500 square feet or more of nonresidential gross floor area, the applicant shall have the necessary engineering completed for the establishment of the alignment; or

D. If the subject property is not a corner lot, and there are no existing permanent right-of-way improvements similar to the standards required by this chapter on the same side of the adjacent right-of-way within 100 feet of the subject property, and the construction of the required improvements would not provide a useful link in the transportation and storm water system. (Ord. 10-09 § 5, 2010; Ord. 431 § 1, 1987)

16.18.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to create an alternative method of land division when dividing property for the purpose of sale, lease or transfer for commercially and industrially zoned property, condominiums and mobile home parks. The Washington State Legislature authorized the binding site plan method of dividing property in RCW 58.17.035 as an alternative to the subdivision or short subdivision process. (Ord. 01-04 § 2, 2001)


16.18.020 Applicability.

A. The binding site plan process to divide property for the purpose of sale, lease or transfer of ownership as an alternative method of land division is available to:

1. The division of land into two or more lots, parcels or tracts in a commercial or industrial zoning district;

2. The division of land for lease when no other structure other than mobile homes, manufactured homes, trailers or recreational vehicles are to be placed on the land;

3. The division of land for condominium purposes into lots or tracts when performed in accordance with Chapters 64.32 and 64.34 RCW and RCW 58.17.040(7), as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.

B. The site that is subject to the binding site plan shall consist of one or more contiguous lots.

C. The site that is subject to the binding site plan may be reviewed independently for developed sites, concurrently with or subsequent to a site development permit application for undeveloped land or concurrently with or subsequent to a building permit application.

The general commercial district encourages the development of commercial uses that will create varied job opportunities and provide services to the community that are not strictly retail in nature. This district will implement the General Commercial category of the comprehensive plan. The uses within this district may require large areas for customer parking, retail service, office establishments, limited outdoor activities, displays and other commercial activities. The businesses locating within these areas often draw customers from the outlying areas rather than from a more limited local trade area. This district is expected to be more automobile-oriented than the CBD district. (Ord. 07-05 § 6, 2007; Ord. 01-03 § 1, 2001)

17.46.080    Signs.

17.46.090    Site plan review.


17.46.010 Purpose.

The WMU waterfront mixed use designation allows a mixture of uses including moderate to high density residential, recreational, and commercial activities to increase the variety of development opportunities where people can enjoy shopping, working, and living in the same area. This district takes advantage of the proximity to the Columbia River. There are three distinct neighborhoods that have been designated as waterfront mixed use.

A. Downtown Waterfront District. This area is envisioned to contain principally mid-rise, higher density residential development with a minor amount of services and retail to serve the immediate area:

1. Public access along the river would be provided;

2. The relatively narrow amount of land available for development, as a result of the highway extension and dramatic topography might produce unusual building forms. 

B. Uptown District.

1. This district is seen as gradually developing over time into a full-scale village, with an array of residential types from low-rise medium density to mid-rise higher density;

2. There would be a wide range of neighborhood-oriented retail and services;

3. In addition to public access along the riverfront, there would be a substantial public space for active and passive recreation;

4. The pattern of streets and blocks would encourage walking. Transit service would be easily available;

5. The riverfront area would include a protected zone for habitat.

C. North Bridge District.

1. This district is intended to attract large commercial uses having more of a regional draw, due to its proximity to major transportation linkages and a major crossroads;

2. Low-rise, medium density residential might also be found in certain locations;

3. Public access to the river would also be a component. (Ord. 07-05 § 6, 2007; Ord. 01-03 § 1, 2001)


17.46.020 Permitted uses.

See Chapter 17.34 EWMC for a matrix of permitted, accessory and conditional uses allowed in the WMU zoning district. (Ord. 07-05 § 6, 2007; Ord. 05-06 § 2, 2005; Ord. 02-22 § 16, 2002; Ord. 01-03 § 1, 2001)


17.46.030 Prohibited uses.

All uses not listed above as permitted uses, accessory uses, or conditional uses shall be prohibited uses. Upon application to the board of adjustment, the board may rule that a use not specifically named in the permitted uses of a district shall be included among the allowed uses if the use is of the same general type and is similar to the permitted uses; however, this section does not authorize the inclusion of a use in a district where it is not listed when the use is specifically listed in another district. (Ord. 07-05 § 6, 2007; Ord. 01-03 § 1, 2001)


17.46.040 Dimensional standards.

The following are dimensional standards in the WMU district:

	Standard	Downtown Waterfront District	Uptown District	North Bridge District

	Maximum building height	75'	35'	65'

	Maximum floor area ratio (not including parking)	3.0	2.0	1.5

	Maximum impervious coverage	90%	80%	75%

	Minimum setback from R-L district	n/a	20'	20'

	Maximum building footprint/building* (see explanation below)	n/a	20,000 sq. ft.	n/a

	Maximum continuous building length* (see explanation below)	n/a	300'	n/a

*The uptown district mixed use designation is located within an established single-family neighborhood. The purpose of the footprint and building length dimensional standard is:

A. To break up the mass and scale of buildings to ensure that development in that area is compatible with the character, scale and sense of place in the neighborhood;

B. To help integrate large-scale development with its surroundings;

C. To promote and facilitate a safe and comfortable pedestrian-scale environment;

D. To encourage a mixture of sizes and structures;

The conditions and requirements set forth in this chapter are general and designed to apply to individual lots and minimum area of parcels. A planned unit development (PUD), as the term is used in this chapter, is an overlay district requiring a rezone and has the following purposes.

A. To permit greater flexibility and consistently more creative and imaginative uses than is generally possible under conventional zoning regulations;

B. To promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a higher level of city attractiveness and quality and preservation of scenic open space;

C. To correlate the intentions of this chapter and other ordinances of the city to encourage developments which will provide a desirable and stable environment in harmony with that of the surrounding area. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.020 Minimum size.

The minimum size of PUD projects is as follows:

Any uses permitted outright or as a conditional use in the zone where the PUD is located shall be permitted in a PUD, subject to the criteria established in this chapter; provided, however, that duplexes or multifamily dwellings may be permitted as a PUD in any residential zone. No use shall be permitted except in conformity with a specific and precise final development plan pursuant to the procedural and regulatory provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.040 Authority to initiate.

A. PUD projects may be initiated by:

1. The owner of all the property involved, if under one ownership; or

2. Jointly by all owners having title to all the property in the area proposed for a PUD project, if there is more than one owner; or

3. A governmental agency; or

4. A person having interest in the property to be included in the PUD;

B. The PUD applications shall be in the name of the recorded owner or owners of property included in the development. The applications may be initially filed by the holder(s) of an equitable interest in or option on such property, but the applicant must evidence a full ownership interest in land (either legal title or the execution of a binding sales agreement) before final approval of the applicant’s plan or the recorded owner or owners must have given written consent satisfactory to the city to imposition of the terms and conditions of the applicant’s plan on the property. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.050 Public services availability.

A. The purpose of this section is to assure that PUD approvals are not granted unless such facilities as water lines, sewer lines and streets exist or are immediately planned in sufficient quantity to service the proposed new development.

B. PUD projects shall be so located with respect to major streets and highways or other transportation facilities that they shall provide direct access to such districts without creating traffic along minor streets in residential neighborhoods outside such districts. Major and minor streets are defined in the city’s arterial street plan.

C. PUD projects shall be so located in relation to sanitary sewers, water lines, storm and surface drainage systems, and other utility systems and installations that neither extension nor enlargement of such systems resulting in higher net public cost or earlier incursion of public cost will be required. Such PUD projects shall be so located with respect to schools, parks, playgrounds and other public facilities that they shall have access in the same degree as would development in a form generally permitted in the area; provided, that a PUD may be approved if, alternatively:

1. The developers will provide private utilities, facilities or services approved by the public agencies which would normally provide such utilities, facilities or services as substituting on an equivalent basis and assure their satisfactory continuing operation and maintenance permanently or until equivalent public utilities, facilities or services are available; or

2. The developers will make provision, acceptable to the city, for offsetting any added net public cost or early commitment of public funds necessitated by such development; or

3. The city is able to make such determinations through experts acceptable to it and at the cost of the developers, considering the difference in anticipated public installation, operation and maintenance costs, and the difference in anticipated public revenue. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)

The city’s technical review committee shall meet with the applicant and provide information to the applicant regarding the relationship of the proposal to general development objectives and policies of the city. A written record of the city’s technical review committee recommendations and comments shall be given to the applicant, and a copy shall be retained on file for future reference. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)

Following formal acceptance, the final development plan shall be transmitted to the city council for final approval, modification or rejection. Approvals subject to modifications or conditions shall be agreed to in writing by the applicant before formal acceptance. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.230 Building permit issuance.

After necessary actions by the city council, such as recording site plans and plats, building permits may be issued and construction may begin. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.240 Amendments to final development plan.

A. Minor changes of lot lines or the combination of lots if no new lots are created or minor changes in location, siting and height of buildings and structures may be authorized by the responsible official if required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved. No change authorized by this subsection may cause any of the following:

1. A change in the use or character of the development;

2. An increase in the overall coverage of structures;

3. An increase in the intensity of use;

4. An increase in the problems of traffic circulation and public utilities;

5. A reduction in approved open space;

6. A reduction of off-street parking and loading space;

7. A reduction in required pavement widths.

B. All other changes in use or rearrangement of lots, blocks and building tracts, or any changes in the provision of common open space and changes other than listed in subsection A of this section, must be made by the city council after report of the responsible official and recommendation by the planning commission. Such amendments may be made only if they are shown to be required by changes in conditions that have occurred since the final plan was approved or changes in the community policy. Any changes which are approved in the final plan must be recorded as amendments in accordance with the procedure established for the recording of the initial final plan documents.

C. The process for amendments to a PUD is the same as for a preliminary application (EWMC 17.68.070 through 17.68.160). A revised final development plan may be required as part of the amendment process. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.250 Construction start and completion limits.

If no construction has begun in the PUD within 24 months from the approval of the PUD and recording of the documents, the approval shall lapse and be of no further effect except that the planning commission, based on the recommendations of the responsible official under EWMC 17.68.260, upon showing of good cause by the applicant, may extend for two periods of 12 months each the time for beginning construction. Upon the expiration of such an extension(s), the final development plan shall become null and void, and a new one shall be required for any development on the subject property. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.260 Review during construction.

After general construction commences, the responsible official shall review, at least once every six months, all building permits issued and compare them to the overall development phasing program. If he determines that the rate of construction of residential units or nonresidential structures substantially differs from the phasing program, he shall so notify the developer and the planning commission in writing; thereafter, the city shall issue such orders to the developer as necessary, and upon continued violation of this section, may suspend the developer from further construction until compliance is achieved. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.270 Plan to run with land – Violations.

The approved final development plan is binding and shall be a restriction on development which runs with the land. Any unauthorized deviation therefrom shall be punishable and enforceable as a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.280 Design criteria.

The design elements established within this chapter shall be used as a guide for an applicant to follow in developing a preliminary and final development plan. The responsible official and the planning commission shall determine from the applicant and other resources available to it whether a PUD preliminary and final development plan vary from these criteria. These criteria shall also be used as the basis for planning commission judgments permitting an increase in overall development density within a PUD. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.290 Design criteria – Density increases in general.

Density increases, as provided in each respective section of this code, shall be governed by the precepts listed in EWMC 17.68.300, 17.68.310 and 17.68.320, which are to be treated as additive, but in no case shall the bonus be more than the maximum for that category. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.300 Design criteria – Density increases for open space.

Open space reservation shall be considered for density increases according to the following provision:

A. An acre of improved common open space permits a maximum increase of 10 percent. If unimproved, an eight percent increase is allowed;

B. A second acre of improved common open space permits a maximum increase of six percent. If unimproved, four percent is allowed;

C. Additional acres of improved common open space permit a maximum increase of four percent. If unimproved, three percent is allowed;

D. A minimum of one acre is required for open space bonuses;

E. The total open space bonus possible is 20 percent. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.310 Design criteria – Density increases for design factors.

Character, identity, and architectural and siting variation incorporated in a development shall be considered cause for density increases not to exceed 20 percent, provided these factors make a substantial contribution to the objectives of a PUD. The degree of distinctiveness and the desirable variation achieved shall govern the amount of density increases which the planning commission may approve. Such variations may increase, but are not limited to, the following:

A. For design factors:

1. A maximum increase of 10 percent for landscaping: streetscape, open spaces and plazas, use of existing landscape, pedestrian-way treatment and recreational areas,

2. A maximum increase of five percent for siting: visual focal points, use of existing physical features such as topography, view, sun and wind environment, variation in building setbacks, building groups (such as clustering) and energy efficient siting;

B. For improved and unimproved open space, a maximum increase of five percent for design features: street sections, architectural styles, harmonious use of materials, parking areas broken by landscape features, varied use of housing types and energy efficient structures;

C. Total possible design and landscape bonuses equal 20 percent. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.320 Design criteria – Density increases – Total distribution within PUD.

The total possible bonus is 40 percent. In PUD’s of 20 acres or larger, density bonuses and total site density are transferable within the PUD area as long as the transfer meets the intent of the PUD ordinance and is approved by the city in the preliminary and final plans. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.330 Building spacing or side yards.

The requirements for building spacing or side yards, as they are often defined, is based on several related factors. Setback requirements within the PUD shall be determined upon review of the factors below:

A. Privacy. The minimum building spacing requirement is intended to provide privacy within the dwelling unit. Where windows are placed in only one of the two fencing walls or there are not two windows, or where the builder provides adequate screening for windows, or where the windows are at such a height or location to provide adequate privacy, the building spacing may be reduced;

B. Light and Air. The building spacing provides one method of ensuring that each room has adequate light and air. Building spacing may be reduced where there are no windows or very small window areas and where rooms have adequate provisions for light and air from another direction;

C. Use. Areas between buildings are often used as service yards, for storage of trash, clotheslines or other utilitarian purposes. Where this use is similar for both houses, a reduction of building space permitting effective design of a utility space shall be permitted. Kitchens and garages are suitable uses for room abutting such utility yards;

D. Building Configuration. Where building configuration is irregular so that the needs expressed in preceding subsections of this section are met by the building configuration, reduced spacing is permissible, as determined by average spacing or by measuring spacing where rooms open toward adjacent buildings. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.340 Front yard.

The minimum front yard is intended to provide privacy and usable yard area for residents. In practice, however, front yards are rarely used, so that only the privacy factor is important. Where a developer provides privacy by reducing traffic flow through street layout such as cul-de-sacs, or by screening or planting, or by facing the structure toward open space or a pedestrian way, or through the room layout, it is possible to reduce the front yard requirement. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.350 Lot width.

A minimum lot width is intended to prevent the construction of long, narrow buildings with inadequate privacy, light and air. There are situations, as in cul-de-sacs, steep slopes or offset lots, where, because of lot configurations or topography, narrow or irregular lots provide the best possible design. Where the design is such that light, air and privacy can be provided, especially for living spaces and bedrooms, a narrower lot width may be permitted. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.360 Site increase for space noncompliance.

Where designs are such that the considerations of EWMC 17.68.330, 17.68.340 and 17.68.350 are not met, site requirements may be increased if, in the responsible official’s judgment, such increases are necessary. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.370 Common open space.

A. Open space includes:

1. Land area of the site not covered by buildings, parking structures or accessory structures except recreation structures (decks may be counted as specified further in these standards);

2. Land which is accessible and available to all occupants of dwelling units for whose use the space is intended.

B. Open space does not include:

1. Proposed street rights-of-way;

2. Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings;

3. School sites;

4. Commercial areas and the buildings, accessory parking buildings, parking and loading facilities for these commercial areas;

5. Areas covered with water or seasonal swamps. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.380 Streets.

A. Right-of-way width and street roadway width may be reduced and standards of design and construction for roadways, both public and private, within residential PUD’s may be modified as is deemed appropriate by the street superintendent with the concurrence of the planning commission and the city council.

B. Right-of-way width and street roadway width may also be reduced, especially where it is found that the plan for the PUD provides for the separation of vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns and provides for adequate off-street parking facilities. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.390 Perimeter buffer zone.

A. There must be a minimum 30-foot buffer zone in any PUD of multifamily or nonresidential buildings or structures that are adjacent to a low density residential use district (SR-20,000, SR-12,500, and R-L district).

B. The buffer zone must be kept free of buildings or structures and must be landscaped, screened or protected by natural features so that adverse effects on surrounding areas are minimized. This buffer zone may be used as part of the open space acreage for the PUD if the planning commission finds that it is suitable for that purpose within the criteria established in EWMC 17.68.370. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.400 Nonresidential uses in residential PUD.

A. The amount and type of commercial facilities to be allowed in a residential PUD shall be based on market analysis furnished by the applicant. The responsible official shall prepare a written report concerning the market analysis and transmit it to the planning commission for the public hearing.

B. The market analysis shall demonstrate that the amount of land proposed is needed and can realistically be supported in commercial use. For these purposes, such market analysis shall contain the following determinations:

1. Determination of the trade areas of the proposed commercial facilities;

2. Determination of the trade area population, present and prospective;

3. Determination of the effective buying power in such trade area;

4. Determination of net potential customer buying power for stores in the proposed commercial facilities and, on such bases, the recommended store types and store floor areas;

5. Identification of the physical impact of proposed commercial development on other land uses within and without the PUD boundaries and effects on the circulation system.

C. Nonresidential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and commercial character are allowed to the extent they are designed and intended primarily to serve the residents of the PUD.

D. No commercial use, nor any building devoted primarily to a commercial use, shall be built or established prior to the residential buildings or uses it is designed or intended to serve.

E. It shall be the burden of the PUD applicant to demonstrate to the planning commission on scale of required nonresidential uses proposed to serve the project and to provide a time frame for the construction of such uses as they relate to the residential development. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.68.410 Business and commercial PUD’S.

A. The foregoing PUD procedures may be employed in established business or commercial zones to encourage business or commercial site layout serving the public in a more satisfactory manner than generally would be possible with the conventional zoning regulations. The same general provisions apply to acceptability of a business or commercial PUD proposal as a residential PUD.

B. Increases in density, building height and floor area in relation to parking spaces may be allowed providing the development includes more than required amounts of developed open space or design excellence. Parking variations must be based on demonstrated feasibility of mutual use of shared facilities. (Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)

1. Security and safety lighting of equipment, buildings and support structure if such lighting is appropriately down-shielded to keep light within the boundaries of the site; and

2. Any lighting of the WCF that may be required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other applicable authority shall be installed in such a manner to minimize impacts on adjacent residences. In instances when a strobe type light is required by the FAA, said strobe light shall be white with no more than a three-second maximum allowable “off” phase.

J. No facility subject to this chapter shall be used in such a manner to support or display any outdoor signage or banners for any commercial or advertisement purposes.

K. Aviation Review Standards. Proposed telecommunication devices, structures or objects shall be reviewed to ensure they do not penetrate any of the airspace surfaces on or near a public or private general aviation facility. Any telecommunication device, structure or object that is determined to penetrate or otherwise obstruct airspace surfaces shall be denied by the review authority. Special attention shall be given to the following:

1. Approach Surface. Land lying beneath the approach surface which extends outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the runway end.

2. Transitional Surface. The transitional surface begins at the runway end and on either side of the runway surface and slopes upward and outward at a seven to one slope meeting the horizontal surface at 150 feet above the elevation of the airport.

3. Horizontal Surface. The horizontal surface begins by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet from the center end of the runway surface creating an elongated oval above the runway. The height of the horizontal surface is 150 feet above the elevation of the airport.

4. Conical Surface. The conical surface begins at the edge of the horizontal surface and extends upward and outward for a distance of 4,000 feet at a slope of 20 to one with an initial elevation of 150 feet above the airport elevation.

5. Pangborn Airport. The delineation of the airspace surfaces described above are generally depicted on the Pangborn Airport overlay parcels exhibit map (Figure 17.70.060(M)) and Douglas County Code Chapter 18.65, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, that is adopted herein by reference as if fully set forth.

L. Federal Requirements. All wireless communications facilities shall meet or exceed the standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owner of any telecommunication facility governed by this chapter shall bring such facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations with six months of the effective date of standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the facility at the owner’s expense.

Formerly 17.70.100)


17.70.100 General siting criteria.

A. Siting criteria for wireless communication facilities are necessary to encourage the siting of those facilities in locations most appropriate based on land use compatibility, neighborhood characteristics, and aesthetic considerations and the demand for wireless communication facilities by the citizens of East Wenatchee. No general siting criteria are necessary for satellite dishes because these facilities are allowed within all zoning districts.

B. Generally, collocation on existing broadcast and relay towers is encouraged by fewer standards and less complex permit procedures. Further, attachment of antenna(s) to existing nonresidential structures and buildings primarily within industrial and commercial zoning districts is preferable to broadcast and relay towers or monopoles.

C. New broadcast and relay towers shall be minimized by collocating wireless facilities on existing towers. New broadcast and relay towers are most appropriately located in the industrial zoning district followed in order of preference by G-C, CBD and C-L zoning districts. Due to the close proximity of the shoreline and critical areas, these types of facilities are not permitted in the WMU or MU commercial district.

D. Wireless Communication Facilities. The following sites shall be considered by applicants as the preferred order for location of proposed wireless facilities including antenna(s), equipment, and equipment shelters. As determined feasible, and in order of preference, the sites are:

1. Existing Broadcast and Relay Towers. On any existing site or tower where a legal wireless telecommunication facility is currently located regardless of underlying zoning.

2. Warehouse and Industrial Zoning. Structures or sites used exclusively for industrial and manufacturing uses within the industrial district. These are areas of more intensive land uses where a full range of public facilities are expected.

3. Publicly Used Structures. Attached to existing public facilities such as water towers, utility structures, fire stations, bridges, and other public buildings within all zoning districts not utilized primarily for recreational uses.

4. Commercial and Public Facilities Sites. Structures or sites used for retail, commercial, and office uses. These are areas of more intensive land uses where a full range of public facilities are expected. These zones in order of priority are G-C, C-L and CBD.

5. Residential Zones. Structures which are not used for residential purposes such as institutional structures and other nonresidential sites and structures may be considered for the installation of attached WCF where the installation complies with all FCC regulations and standards.

6. Residential Structures. Wireless communication facilities attached to residential structures are not permitted in any residential zoning district. (Ord. 19-11 § 8 (Exh. D), 2019; Ord. 10-03 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 02-22 § 18, 2002. Formerly 17.70.110)


17.70.110 Abandonment.

If any wireless telecommunication facility shall cease to be used for a period of 365 consecutive days, the department of community development shall notify the owner, with a copy to the applicant, that the site will be subject to a determination that such site has been abandoned. The owner shall have 30 days from receipt of said notice to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the wireless telecommunication facility has been in use or under repair during the period. If the owner fails to show that the wireless telecommunication facility has been in use or under repair during the period, the city council shall issue a determination of abandonment for the site. Upon issuance of the final determination of abandonment, the owner shall, within 90 days, dismantle and remove the wireless telecommunication facility. If such facility is not removed within said 90 days, the city may remove the facility at the expense of the property owner. If there are two or more users of the facility, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the facility. (Ord. 10-03 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 02-22 § 18, 2002. Formerly 17.70.120)


17.70.120 Fees – Wireless communications permit fees.

In addition to the building permit application and associated fee, any person required to apply for a wireless communications permit under this chapter shall submit an application for approval to the administrator on forms as required by the administrator. The fees for such applications are described below.

A. Permit Application Fee. The wireless communications permit application shall be accompanied by a base filing fee of $250.00, which fee shall be paid at the time of submitting the application. No application shall be deemed complete unless such application has been submitted and the base fees paid.

B. Engineering Fees. In addition to the fees expressly provided in this section, the applicant shall reimburse the city for the actual costs of all engineering fees incurred by the city in processing the application. The applicant shall become obligated to pay and shall reimburse the city for these fees as the fees are incurred by the city. In no event shall the applicant receive permit approval for the wireless communication facility until all such fees have been paid. (Ord. 10-03 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 02-22 § 18, 2002.

17.72.005 Purpose.

The purpose of the general regulations chapter is to provide a concise reference to requirements that are common to many different zoning districts, thereby providing a more efficient utilization of this title. (Ord. 07-05 § 7, 2007)


17.72.010 Off-street parking.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for safe, efficient and well-designed off-street parking in adequate numbers for the different land uses described in this title by providing standards and design requirements.

B. Applicability. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as hereby established.

1. The provisions of this section shall apply to all zoning districts and land uses within the city of East Wenatchee, except within the downtown business area as shown on the map figure in subsection (I) of this section.

2. Off-street parking as required by this section shall be provided when:

a. Any new structure or building is constructed;

b. Any structure or building is relocated or moved onto the property;

c. Change in use, alteration or enlargement of a site or structure. Whenever a building or a piece of land is put to a use different from the immediately preceding use, or when a building or land use is remodeled, reconstructed or expanded, adequate off-street parking shall be provided consistent with the new use, reconstruction or expansion of the premises.

C. General Requirements.

1. No application for a development permit shall be deemed complete until plans complying with the requirements for off-street parking and loading areas have been submitted in accordance with this section.

2. Every lot or parcel of land or portion thereof used as a public or private parking area shall be developed and maintained in accordance with this section.

3. Off-street parking shall be provided in the number prescribed in subsection (G) of this section together with passageways sufficient for its reasonable use, including but not limited to pedestrian use and traffic circulation, as provided in the dimensional standards shown on diagrams in subsection (H) of this section.

4. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be completed and in compliance with this section at the time of initial occupancy of a site or structure.

5. Off-street parking spaces and driveways shall not be used at any time for purposes other than their intended use, i.e., the temporary storage of motor vehicles used by persons visiting or having business to conduct on the premises for which the parking is provided; provided, however, the site plan review committee may approve other uses it deems reasonable that will not adversely impact parking requirements for the primary use of the property.

6. Off-street parking spaces required and intended for use by occupants or users of specific premises shall not be leased or rented to others, nor shall such space be made unavailable through other means to the users for whom the parking spaces are intended. This, however, does not preclude shared parking arrangements or combined parking approved by the city community development director or other activities approved by the site plan review committee.

7. Site Plan. A site plan shall be submitted with the development application and approved by the review authority prior to the issuance of a building or land use permit. The site plan shall include the following:

a. The parking area location, size, shape, and design of the parking spaces; and

b. The location and dimensional details of curb cuts, intersecting roads or streets, lighting, drainage, landscaping, irrigation, circulation within the parking lot, and other features for the proposed parking lot development.

8. All required parking spaces shall remain open and accessible for parking during the hours the use is open to the public or residents.

9. In the case of mixed uses, the requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of those required for the multiple uses computed separately as specified in subsection (G) of this section. Off-street parking provided for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking for any other use, except as expressly provided for in this section.

10. Parking facilities shall be developed in accordance with the landscaping standards in EWMC 15.48.080, 17.72.060, 17.72.070, 17.72.080, 17.72.090, and 17.72.100, as now exist or may hereafter be amended. Notwithstanding any other contrary provisions contained in this section, landscaping or fencing shall not exceed a height of three feet for a distance of 25 feet from street intersections and for a distance of 15 feet on either side of vehicle access points to public or private streets. All trees planted in the area delineated above shall have a canopy that starts at least five feet above finished grade at the time of planting as measured using the standards established by the American Standard for Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen, currently Publication No. ANSI Z60.1-1990, as revised and amended from time to time.

11. Stall Overhang. Parking areas may be designed so that the car bumper overhangs the curb into landscape areas provided upon the same property as the parking area. If such overhang area is provided, the stall length may be reduced by a maximum of one and one-half feet.

12. Driveway and ramp slope, width and location shall be provided in accordance with the standards and requirements established by the code compliance officer and city street superintendent. Except for single-family and duplex dwellings on individual lots, groups of more than two parking spaces shall be so located and served by a driveway that their use will require no backing movements or maneuvering within a street or right-of-way other than an alley.

13. Garbage Receptacles/Snow Storage. The design of off-street parking facilities should consider the access and placement of garbage receptacles and provisions for storage and removal of snow.

14. Compact Cars. Parking facilities for nonresidential uses may have up to 25 percent of the stalls reduced in size to accommodate compact cars, provided:

a. Compact car spaces shall be located so as not to be significantly more convenient to use than the standard size spaces;

b. Each compact car space or grouping of spaces shall be conspicuously identified as being suited for compact cars only by marking each space with the words “COMPACT” in capital letters a minimum of eight inches in height.

15. Unspecified Uses. In the case of a use not specifically listed in subsection (G) of this section, the requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be determined by the community development director. The community development director may consider, but is not limited to, the following in establishing parking requirements for an unspecified use. Such determination shall be classified as a Type IIA action as set forth in EWMC 19.01.030.

a. Any use similar to any of the uses in subsection (G) of this section; or

b. Documentation submitted by the applicant regarding actual parking demand for the proposed use; or

c. Evidence in available planning and technical studies relating to the proposed use; or

d. Required parking for the proposed use as determined by other comparable jurisdictions.

16. Fractions. When the number of required parking spaces for a particular use or building results in a fractional space, any fraction less than 0.5 shall be disregarded and any fraction of 0.5 or greater shall be counted as one space. When calculating parking reduction incentives in subsection (F) of this section, reductions shall be calculated only in whole numbers.

17. All parking spaces shall be clearly designated with paint, raised rails or other devices. A wheel stop shall be provided for each space that abuts a pedestrian walkway or any structure. All structures shall be guarded with suitable control devices visible to the driver.

18. Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate the off-street parking areas shall be so arranged that it will not project light rays directly upon any adjoining property in a residential district.

19. All parking facilities shall be maintained in a clean and litter-free condition.

20. Handicapped spaces shall be provided and designed in accordance with Chapter 51-40 WAC, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended.

21. Loading areas for child day care centers, and preschools, shall be designed and located so vehicles using those spaces do not project into any public right-of-way.

22. Any off-street parking area for 10 or more cars shall meet the following additional requirements:

a. For commercial or industrial uses the location and design of all access or egress points shall be no closer than 15 feet to any lot used for single-family residential purposes;

b. The location and design of all points of ingress and egress to parking areas shall be subject to the review and approval of the city street superintendent;

c. The parking facility and its access ways shall be developed with a durable, dustless surface of asphalt or concrete;

d. All surface runoff shall be retained and disposed of on-site, or disposed of in a system designed for such runoff and which does not flood or damage adjacent properties. Systems designed for runoff retention and control shall be designed and constructed as approved by the city street superintendent pursuant to Chapter 16.20 EWMC, Design Standards, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended.

23. Off-Street Loading. All commercial and industrial uses which have a gross floor area of 5,000 square feet or more shall provide off-street loading/unloading spaces outside of the required front yard setback, in accordance with the following table:

	Gross Square Footage	Spaces Required

	5,000 – 30,000	1

	30,000 – 100,000	2

	100,000 and over	3

Each off-street loading space shall have a minimum of 12 feet in width and 45 feet in length and not less than 14 feet of unobstructed vertical clearance.

b. Loading Space Location. The required loading and related maneuvering space shall be located on or abutting the property served and shall not include any designated off-street parking areas. Loading spaces shall be located so that trucks do not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic movement and no part of any vehicle using the loading space shall project into the right-of-way of any public or private road. All loading space areas shall be clearly designated as a “truck loading area.”

c. Any loading space located within 100 feet of areas zoned for residential use shall be designed and operated as necessary to reduce noise and visual impacts. Noise and visual mitigation measures may include a combination of architectural or structural barriers, landscaping, berms and/or restrictions on the hours of operation as approved by the community development director.

D. Shared Parking Standards. Shared parking may be permitted when the following standards and criteria can be met:

a. Paved sidewalks or paved pedestrian paths (including alleys if the same exist) connect the shared parking facility and the land use using such shared parking facility; and

b. There is adequate lighting on the sidewalk or pedestrian path and parking lot to provide safe walking to the off-site facility as determined by the community development director.

6. Agreement. An agreement, lease, deed, contract or easement establishing shared use of a parking area shall be submitted to the community development director for review and approval prior to execution and shall be in a form capable of recording with the Douglas County auditor’s office. The city shall be notified of any termination or change in the use of the individual property subject to the shared parking standards.

7. Termination of Shared Parking Agreements.

a. In the event that a shared parking agreement is to be terminated, those businesses or other uses with less than the required parking shall notify the community development director 60 days prior to the termination and take one of the following actions:

i. Provide at least 50 percent of the required parking within 90 days, and provide the remaining parking within one calendar year following the termination of the shared use; or

ii. Apply for a zoning variance pursuant to Chapter 17.88 EWMC, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended.

b. If sufficient parking is not provided, the use, or that portion of the use out of compliance, shall be terminated within one calendar year following the termination of the shared use agreement. This requirement shall be established as a condition of the occupancy permit for uses relying on shared parking.

E. Combined Parking Standards. Combined parking may be permitted when the following standards and criteria can be met:

1. When two or more land uses on separate properties or ownerships have cooperatively established or operate a common parking facility, such uses may develop combined parking agreements to satisfy the standards of this section.

2. Only 60 percent of the required parking of any single land use may qualify for combined parking; in other words, 40 percent of any required parking of any single land use must be met on-site while the remainder can be met through combined parking agreements.

3. Required parking shall be based on the combined total of the required parking for the separate land uses.

4. Location. The combined parking facility is located within a 300-foot radius of the off-site use being served as measured from the property line of the lot upon which the other use is located to the nearest property line of the off-site shared parking facility.

a. Paved sidewalks or paved pedestrian paths (including paved alleys, if the same exist) connect the combined parking facility and the land use using such combined parking facility; and

b. There is adequate lighting on the sidewalk or pedestrian path and parking lot to provide safe walking to the off-site facility as determined by the community development director.

6. Agreement. An agreement, lease, deed, contract or easement establishing combined use of a parking area shall be submitted to the community development director for review and approval prior to execution and shall be in a form capable of recording with the Douglas County auditor’s office. The city shall be notified of any termination or change in the use of the individual property subject to the combined parking standards.

7. Termination of Combined Parking Agreements.

a. In the event that a combined parking agreement is to be terminated, those businesses or other uses with less than the required parking shall notify the community development director 60 days prior to the termination and take one of the following actions:

ii. Apply for a zoning variance pursuant to Chapter 17.88 EWMC as now exists or as may hereafter be amended.

b. If sufficient parking is not provided, the use, or that portion of the use out of compliance, shall be terminated within one calendar year following the termination of the combined parking agreement. This requirement shall be established as a condition of the occupancy permit for uses relying on combined parking.

F. Parking Reduction Incentives. A 15 percent reduction of the required parking set forth in subsection (G) of this section will be granted when a development meets all of the following requirements:

1. The project must be within a 700-foot radius of a public bus shelter or transfer station as measured from the nearest property line of the lot upon which the use is located to the bus shelter or transfer station. If a bus shelter is not within 700 feet, one can be provided by the applicant when it would be located and installed at a site approved by the local transit authority, LINK.

2. A commute trip reduction plan is developed by the applicant and approved by the community development director which demonstrates meaningful ways, such as carpooling, vanpools, transit enhancements, informational displays, or bicycle commuting, to reduce reliance on automobiles.

3. The proposed use is not auto-dependent, such as a drive-in restaurant.

4. The following minimum safety requirements are met:

a. There are paved sidewalks or paved pedestrian paths, including paved alleys, between the transit facility and the land use using such transit facility; and

C. Within the R-M, R-H, CBD and G-C districts any building or structure proposed to be located closer than 30 feet from a residential structure in a R-L district shall not exceed a height greater than the average height of adjoining residential structures. Buildings or structures may be modulated to create a daylight plane when adjoining a residential district, provided the buildings or structures do not intercept a 1:1 or 45-degree daylight plane incline inward from a height of six feet above the existing grade at the district boundary line.

D. General Aviation. Buildings, structures or objects proposed to be located within one mile of a general aviation airport shall be reviewed to ensure they do not penetrate any of the airspace surfaces on or near a general aviation airport. The review authority shall deny any building, structure or object that is determined to penetrate or otherwise obstruct airspace surfaces. Special attention shall be given to the following areas:

1. Approach Surface. Land lying beneath the approach surface which extends outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the runway end; and

2. Transitional Surface. The transitional surface begins at the runway end and on either side of the runway surface and slopes upward and outward at a 7:1 slope meeting the horizontal surface at 150 feet above the elevation of the airport.

E. Shoreline Master Program. The height of any buildings, structures or objects proposed to be located within the jurisdiction of the shoreline master program shall be subject to the height restrictions as prescribed by the applicable shoreline regulations.

F. The following types of structures or structural components are not subject to the building height limitation of this title except the limitations on height as outlined in subsections C, D, and E of this section:

C. No accessory structure shall occupy any part of a required front yard area.

D. Accessory structures may observe a three-foot setback in the side and rear yard areas; provided, that no combination of structures extend more than 50 percent of the horizontal distance of the rear or side property line. Accessory buildings may observe a zero setback where a rear or side property line is adjacent to an alley. In all other circumstances, accessory buildings shall observe a five-foot setback in rear and side yard areas. No roof eave or any other part of the structure may project or overhang across any property line and said structure shall be constructed with a roof that directs stormwater runoff away from any neighboring properties.

E. All gasoline station pump islands shall be set back at least 15 feet from all property lines.

F. If a lot in a residential district not facing on a substandard street or half-street is adjoined on both sides by lots on which structures are set back less than the required front yard setback, a new structure on the heretofore vacant center lot may set back a distance equal to the average setback of the two adjoining properties but in no case shall the garage setback be less than 20 feet. All lots used for this average setback provision must be located within the same zoning district.

G. Cul-de-Sacs or Irregular Lots. No building or structure shall be erected where the front building setback line measures less than 60 feet wide, except when located in a manufactured home park or if specifically approved as a part of a planned development.

H. Boundary Streets or Substandard Streets. For structures constructed on boundary streets where only one-half of the street has been dedicated or streets with substandard right-of-way based upon the street classification, the front yard setback distance shall include the required front yard setback for the specific zoning district plus the required distance from the required right-of-way centerline.

For example: A structure in the R-L district on a local access street where the required right-of-way distance from centerline is 25 feet, the setback would be 15 feet for the primary dwelling and 20 feet for the garage plus 25 feet for a total of 40 feet for the primary dwelling and 45 feet for the garage.

I. Cornices, eaves, gutters, sunshades and other similar architectural features may project not more than two feet into required yard areas. Chimneys, staircases and steps are considered a part of a structure or a building and are not permitted to project into a required yard area. Except that steps or staircases with a total height of less than 42 inches may project into the required front or rear yard area. No projection of any kind is permitted to project into any easement (public or private). Terraces at grade level covering not over 10 percent of the ground area may be allowed within required yard areas.

J. Reduction of Front Yard Setback Requirements in Consideration of Slope. To ensure safe ingress/egress to the property, the process provided below is subject to the approval of the city engineer:

1. Front yard requirements may be reduced under the following conditions:

a. The front yard may be reduced by five feet, when the natural slope of the front 50 feet of the lot equals or exceeds one foot of fall/rise in seven feet of distance from the property line (i.e., slope of 14 percent or greater).

b. The front yard may be reduced by 10 feet, when the natural slope of the front 50 feet of the lot equals or exceeds one foot of fall/rise in four feet of distance from the front property line (i.e., slope of 25 percent or greater).

2. To avoid backing of vehicles directly onto the street, all driveways and entrances to garages and carports shall be parallel or nearly parallel to the street or configured in such a manner that provides a turnaround area or sufficient unobscured parking area to allow vehicles to be completely outside the structure before entering the street.

3. The natural grade of the slope shall be maintained as much as possible.

4. The impact on sight distance along the adjoining street shall be considered when reviewing and approving the use of this setback reduction process. (Ord. 16-12 § 7, 2017; Ord. 07-05 § 7, 2007; Ord. 01-03 § 1, 2001; Ord. 91-5 § 2, 1991)


17.72.045 Lot size averaging.

A. A subdivision or short subdivision will meet the minimum lot area of the zone in which it is located if the area in lots plus critical areas and their buffers and areas designated as open space or recreational uses, if any, divided by the total number of lots equals or exceeds the minimum lot area of the zone in which the property is located. In no case shall the density achieved be greater than the gross site area density permitted within the underlying zoning district.

B. This section shall only apply within residential zoning districts.

C. Each single lot shall be at least 3,000 square feet in area.

D. Lots in subdivisions and short subdivisions created under the provisions of this section shall have a maximum lot coverage of 55 percent.

E. Lots with less than the prescribed minimum lot area for the zone in which they are located shall have a minimum lot width of at least 40 feet, and front yard setbacks of 15 feet except that garages must be set back 18 feet from the right-of-way (with the exception of alleys) and corner lots may reduce one front yard setback to no less than 15 feet.

F. Preliminary subdivisions approved utilizing lot averaging shall not be recorded by divisions unless such divisions individually or together as cumulative, contiguous parcels, satisfy the requirements of this section.

G. Roadways and surface detention/retention facilities shall not count toward the calculations for lot size averaging unless the detention/retention facility is either (1) designed and constructed so as to appear as a natural wetland system, or (2) designed and constructed in a manner that provides active or passive recreational benefits in a natural or manicured landscaped setting. (Ord. 16-12 § 8, 2017; Ord. 07-05 § 7, 2007)

In order to reduce the incompatible characteristics of abutting properties with different land use classifications, the following standards shall apply. This type of landscaping will be installed in planting strips on the interior property line according to the other requirements of this chapter, and the amount of landscaping shall not be counted towards meeting the minimum stated in EWMC 17.72.060.

A. Type I screening is intended to create a visual separation between incompatible uses. Type I requirements are as follows: landscaping shall be made up of evergreen trees planted at a maximum of 15 feet on center. Deciduous trees are also encouraged to add seasonal and textural variation. Up to 25 percent of required evergreen trees may be deciduous trees. Medium-sized shrubs (three to five feet maturity height) and groundcover plants shall be added at a density to form an effective barrier to cover 85 percent of the ground surfacing and horizontal separation within three years. Type I landscaping shall incorporate the use of either earth-berming or a six-foot-high sight-screening fence. If the earth-berming alternative is chosen, medium-sized shrubs shall be spaced at a maximum of four and one-half feet on center. If the fence option is selected, maximum spacing shall be six feet on center. Minimum width shall not be less than 10 feet.

1. Type I screening is required when the following land use districts abut: 

 

	District in Which Development Is Proposed	District to Be

Screened

	R-M, R-H	R-L

1. The nearest point on the boundary line of a residential zoning district; 

2. The nearest point on the property line of a public park; or

3. The nearest point on the property line of the lot containing an adult entertainment facility, a public library, public or private nursery school or preschool, public or private primary or secondary school, day care, community youth center, or place of worship.

D. Variances. Whenever the applicant for an adult entertainment facility believes that the separation requirements set forth in this section are not necessary to achieve an effective degree of physical separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and the zoning districts and uses identified in subsection B of this section, the applicant shall have the right to apply for a variance from the separation requirements subject to the procedures set forth in Chapter 17.88 EWMC (Variances) and upon payment of the applicable fee for a variance application. In determining whether a variance should be granted, the board of adjustment shall consider the following criteria in addition to the variance criteria set forth in Chapter 17.88 EWMC (Variances):

1. The extent to which physical features would result in an effective separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and any zoning districts or uses identified in subsection B of this section in terms of visibility and access;

2. The extent to which the proposed adult entertainment facility complies with the goals and policies of the East Wenatchee Municipal Code;

3. The extent to which the proposed adult entertainment facility is compatible with adjacent and surrounding land uses;

4. The availability or lack of alternative locations for the proposed adult entertainment facility;

5. The extent to which the proposed adult entertainment facility can be avoided by alternative vehicular and pedestrian routes; and

6. The extent to which the applicant can minimize the adverse secondary effects associated with the proposed adult entertainment facility.

If, after considering these criteria and the variance criteria set forth in Chapter 17.88 EWMC (Variances), the board of adjustment finds that an effective degree of physical separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and the zoning districts and uses identified in subsection B of this section can be achieved without requiring the full distance of separation provided by this section, the board of adjustment shall determine the degree of variance to be allowed and shall grant the variance. Otherwise, the variance application shall be denied.

E. Nonconforming Adult Entertainment Facilities. An adult entertainment facility shall be deemed a nonconforming use and shall be subject to the requirements of Chapter 17.76 EWMC (Nonconforming Uses and Structures) if a zoning district or use identified in subsection B of this section locates within 500 feet of such adult entertainment facility after the date that such adult entertainment facility has located within the city in accordance with the requirements of this section.

17.72.260 Required use of public sanitary sewer system.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the public health by providing rules establishing when connection to public sewers, within the urban growth area (UGA), is required as a condition of development. Nothing in this section authorizes any violation of regulations for on-site sewage disposal systems adopted by the State Department of Health or by the Chelan-Douglas Health District.

B. Permanent Sewer Facilities. The primary means of wastewater collection and disposal in the urban growth area shall be construction and extension of permanent sanitary sewer facilities connecting to the Douglas County sewer district. All such construction shall be in accordance with the rules, regulations, and requirements prescribed by the Douglas County sewer district and by the state of Washington.

C. Connection Required. Inside the UGA, connection to a public sanitary sewer is required for all development projects under the following criteria:

1. For the purposes of this section, “development” means:

a. The construction of a residence, structure, or facility resulting in the production of sewage.

b. The substantial modification or alteration of an existing structure if the modification or alteration increases the sewage generated from the structure and would require installation of a larger capacity on-site sewage disposal system.

c. Any new land division project, including but not limited to subdivision, short subdivision, or binding site plan.

2. Development of any parcel located within the UGA that directly abuts a public sewer system that is located within a public right-of-way or easement.

3. Development of any parcel of real property located within 200 feet of any Douglas County sewer district sanitary sewer facility is required, at his/her expense, to extend the sewer main and connect all applicable plumbing outlets from such buildings or structures directly to the public sewer. The distance between the property and the public sanitary sewer facility is measured along the usual or most feasible route of access to the nearest property line of the subject property.

4. Additionally, the owner of a residence or other facility served by an on-site system that has failed, as determined by the local health officer, must connect if the parcel abuts a public sewer system.

D. Exceptions. Connection to a public sewer is required unless one of the following exceptions applies:

1. The building permit application is for an alteration, expansion, or replacement of an existing structure already utilizing an on-site sewage disposal system that has been tested and is certified to be functioning properly and the proposal does not require installation of a larger capacity on-site sewage disposal system.

2. The building permit application is for a new structure, consistent with the requirements of the Chelan-Douglas Health District codes, that lawfully incorporates no sewerage effluent facility.

3. The parcel is located more than 200 feet from any Douglas County sewer district sanitary sewer facility as measured along the usual or most feasible route of access to the nearest property line of the subject property and meets one of the following conditions:

a. The land division is planned and designed to be provided with a full range of urban level services.

b. The design for the land division includes specific provisions for future accommodation of public sewers in a manner which will allow for future development at appropriate urban densities.

c. If the property is located within 500 feet of a sewer service facility, the district, at its discretion, may require dry sewers and/or side sewer stub outs to be constructed. In determining the location and grade of the dry lines, future ultimate development of property in the vicinity must be considered in designing the system to accommodate all properties which may subsequently require the use of the facility.

d. The land division is configured in a manner which provides reasonable assurance that subsequent redevelopment will comply with the minimum urban densities when public sewer service becomes available. A site plan for subsequent redevelopment is required to be filed and recorded. The site plan under this section shall be vested in the same manner as any land division.

e. The plat, short plat or binding site plan includes as a condition of approval a prohibition of further division of the property until public sewer becomes available.

4. Approval of any building permit or land division application utilizing one of the exceptions above is contingent upon submittal of a legally binding agreement with the district in which the property owner and successors in interest agree to:

a. Connection to sanitary sewers within 24 months of notification by the district that sanitary sewer service is available for all parcels containing an existing building;

b. Participation without protest in any sewer local improvement district (LID) or utility local improvement district (ULID); and

c. Agreement to pay any connection fees and monthly charges assessed by the district, LID, or ULID.

The agreement must be in a form acceptable to the administrator and to the district and must be recorded with the property records of the county. Lots that are vacant at the time the notice is provided as described above will be required to connect when a building permit application is submitted.

E. Douglas County Sewer District Service Boundary. If the property proposed for development is located outside of the Douglas County sewer district service boundary, a legally binding agreement with the district in which the property owner and successors in interest agree to annexation of the property into the district boundary when proposed by the district must be recorded with the property records of the county in a form acceptable to the administrator and to the district.

F. Utility Local Improvement District – No Protest Agreement. The Douglas County sewer district has the authority to establish utility local improvement districts (ULIDs) for the purpose of constructing or reconstructing sewer systems, by the method and manner prescribed in state law within their service area boundary and to levy special assessments to pay in whole the cost of any improvements. The city and county may collectively work with the district to extend services in conjunction with a road improvement project. For any development proposed within the district in an area not currently served by existing service lines, the property owner must execute a legally binding agreement with the district. As part of the agreement, the property owner and successors in interest must agree to:

1. Prompt connection with sanitary sewers when they become available;

2. Participation without protest in any sewer local improvement district (LID), road improvement district (RID), or utility local improvement district (ULID); and

3. An agreement to pay any connection fees and monthly charges assessed by the district, LID, RID, or ULID. The agreement must be in a form acceptable to the administrator and must be recorded with the property records of the county. (Ord. 15-12 § 6 (Exh. B), 2015)

B. Setback and Sight Distance. Freestanding signs may be permitted anywhere on the premises, except in a required side yard; provided, the sign does not project over any sidewalk or within five feet from the face of curb, except as provided in EWMC 17.74.080.

C. Clearance. Clearance shall be measured as the distance from the lowest point of any sign to the finished grade directly below the sign.

1. Over Pedestrian Ways. All signs over pedestrian ways shall provide a minimum of seven and one-half feet of clearance.

2. Over Vehicular Ways. All signs over vehicular ways shall provide a minimum of 13.5 feet of clearance.

D. Illumination. Illumination from any sign shall be shaded, shielded, directed, or reduced so as to avoid undue brightness, glare, or reflection of light onto private or public property or right-of-way in the surrounding area, and so as to avoid unreasonable distractions of pedestrians or motorists.

E. Computations. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:

1. Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including the area encompassing the address of the property, any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall that is clearly incidental to the display itself. If there is a space between letters or groups of letters (horizontally or vertically) of 24 inches or more, the area of each grouping shall be calculated separately using the above method. In the case of a mural incorporating commercial wording, the sign area shall include only the portion of the mural that contains the wording, circumscribed as set forth above.

2. Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign area shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back or in opposition of 130 degrees or less, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. No more than two faces are permitted per freestanding sign. If the opposing faces of a sign are more than 130 degrees, both opposing faces shall be used in calculating sign size.

3. Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the base of the sign to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. The “base” is the lowest part of the surface of the ground that a solid object stands on. For examples, see the figures below:

(Ord. 14-03 § 5, 2014; Ord. 13-04 § 14, 2013; Ord. 11-03 § 3, 2011; Ord. 10-02 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2000-03 § 1, 2000)


17.74.090 Master sign plan option.

This section provides a mechanism under which special consideration can be given to signs which use a master sign plan to integrate signs into the framework of a building or buildings, landscape, topography and other design features of the property, utilizing an overall design theme. The director may allow deviations from the requirements and restrictions of this chapter for signs that are processed using the master sign plan option, provided the following conditions are met:

A. This process is only applicable in the commercial and industrial zoning districts.

B. Sign Height and Area. The sign height and area may increase three percent for each one lineal foot that the sign is moved closer to the building than the minimum setback, provided the sign does not exceed 30 percent more than the maximum allowable sign height and area specified in EWMC 17.74.080; or

C. Master Sign Plan. The owners of two or more contiguous (disregarding intervening alleys) lots, or the owner of a single lot with more than one building/business (not including accessory buildings) or approved multi-tenant complex may file with the director for such lots or building a master sign plan. The master sign plan may increase the total allowable sign area up to a maximum increase of 30 percent. The allowable sign area is computed by adding the total sign area allowed for each lot or business based upon the formula in Table 17.74.080A plus 30 percent. This increased area may be allocated in any manner within each lot as the owner elects; provided, that any one sign does not exceed 30 percent of the individual sign area allowed in EWMC 17.74.080 and freestanding or monument signs are not located on streets abutting an R-L district. The number of freestanding signs is limited to the quantity allowed within the applicable district. The total number of wall signs permitted may be exceeded to accommodate the additional allowed area; provided, that the total allowed sign area is not exceeded and the following criteria are met:

1. The master sign plan shall contain all of the information required for a sign plan specified in EWMC 17.74.020 and shall also specify standards for consistency among all signs on the lots affected by the plan with regard to lettering or graphic style, lighting, location of each sign on the buildings, materials and sign proportions.

2. The master sign plan for all lots with multiple uses or users shall limit the number of freestanding signs to a total of one for each street on which the lots included in the plan have frontage and shall provide for shared or common usage of such signs.

3. The master sign plan shall be included in the development application for a planned unit development, conditional use permit, or other project permit applications required by the city of East Wenatchee for the proposed development and shall be processed simultaneously with such applications.

4. If an amended master sign plan is filed for a property on which existing signs are located and a comprehensive sign plan has been approved previously under this section, it shall include a schedule for bringing into conformance, within three years, all signs not conforming to the proposed amended plan.

5. After approval of a master sign plan, no sign may be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan; and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any other provision of the EWMC. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and any other provisions of the EWMC, the most restrictive provision shall govern.

6. An architect or design professional as approved by the director shall prepare master sign plans developed under this section. (Ord. 10-02 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2000-03 § 1, 2000)


17.74.110 Nonconforming signs.

A. Purpose. The ultimate purpose of any zoning or land use regulation is to confine certain classes of buildings to certain localities and to restrict other uses. The continued existence of those which are nonconforming are inconsistent with these goals, and therefore nonconforming buildings and uses should be reduced to conformity as completely and quickly as possible without causing substantial injustice.

B. Abatement and Loss of Nonconforming Status. A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its nonconforming designation and shall either be removed or brought into compliance with this chapter if:

1. The sign is structurally altered in any way which tends to or makes the sign less in compliance with the requirements of this code than it was before the alteration; or

2. The sign is relocated; or

3. The sign is altered, damaged or destroyed and the value of the alteration, damage or destruction exceeds 50 percent of the value of the sign based upon the market value of a similar sign using no depreciation; or

4. If the property is vacated for a 12-month period; or

5. The business or tenant associated with the sign changes and any new sign, of any type, is proposed for the site; or

6. If the sign has been improperly maintained or has become structurally unsound.

On the applicability of any one of subsections (B)(1) through (B)(6) of this section, the sign shall no longer be designated a nonconforming sign. The director shall notify the sign user, sign owner or owner of the property upon which the sign is located of cancellation of the designation. The sign shall immediately be brought into compliance with this chapter and a new sign permit secured for the replacement sign, or the sign shall be removed. Such sign shall be designated a nuisance and processed in accordance with the nuisance abatement procedures set forth in Chapter 8.20 EWMC, as amended.

C. Nonconforming Sign Maintenance and Repair. Nothing in this section shall relieve the owner or user of a nonconforming sign or owner of the property on which the nonconforming sign is located from the provisions of this code regarding safety, maintenance and repair of signs, and from the provisions on prohibited and abandoned signs. Any nonconforming sign that is maintained or repaired in a manner in which the sign loses its nonconforming status pursuant to subsection B of this section shall immediately be brought into compliance with this code and a new permit secured therefor, or the sign shall be removed.

D. Exemption. The city may elect not to apply any provisions of this section if the removal of a sign would require the city to pay compensation under any federal, state or other law, including Chapter 47.42 RCW. (Ord. 14-03 § 6, 2014; Ord. 10-02 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2000-03 § 1, 2000)


17.74.115 Variances.

A variance is the mechanism by which the city may grant relief from the provisions of this chapter where practical difficulty renders compliance with the provisions of this chapter an unnecessary hardship.

A. Recognizing that there are certain cases that may, or may not, be detrimental to aesthetic character, public health, safety and general welfare, and the effectiveness of visual communication in the city depending upon the facts of each particular case, a limited power to issue variance permits and to interpret any section of the title is vested with the hearing examiner.

B. Any person may apply to the hearing examiner for a variance from the standards in this chapter. The sign variance shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in Chapter 17.88 EWMC, as amended. The hearing examiner may approve a variance from the requirements of this code if the applicant demonstrates that:

1. Strict application of the code requirement would deny the applicant a reasonable opportunity to communicate by sign in a manner similar to like persons or uses because of an unusual or unique circumstance relating to the property or the proposal, such as site or building location, building design, physical features of the property, or other circumstance not created by the applicant;

2. The sign which would result from the variance will not affect the surrounding neighborhood or other property affected by the request in a manner materially inconsistent with the purposes of this sign code; and

3. The degree of the variance is limited to that reasonably necessary to alleviate the problem created by the unique of unusual circumstances identified in subsection A of this section.

C. Variances shall only be granted for deviation from the location, height, size, and area requirements for signs – no use variances shall be permitted. (Ord. 10-02 § 3 (Exh. A), 2010)

B. A checklist is not needed if the city and the applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency.

C. For private proposals, the applicant is required to complete the environmental checklist. The city may provide assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

D. The city may decide to complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if any of the following occurs:

1. The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

2. The applicant has provided inadequate or inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

E. The applicant shall pay to the city the actual costs of providing information under subparagraph D(2). (Ord. 90-5 § 2 Exh. A, 1992)


18.06.130 Threshold determinations – Mitigated DNS.

A. The responsible official may issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of the proposal made by the applicant.

B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a determination of significance (DS) is likely. The request must:

1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

2. Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official’s response to the request for early notice shall:

1. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific areas of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS; and

2. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, and may revise the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal along with a revised environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changes or clarified proposal.

1. If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS if the city determines that no additional information or mitigation measures are required.

2. If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures, clarifications, changes or conditions must be in writing and must be specific.

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

E. The city shall not act upon a proposal for which a mitigated DNS has been issued for 15 days after the date of issuance.

F. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the licensing decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. Failure to comply with the designated mitigation measures shall be grounds for suspension and/or revocation of any license issued.

G. If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) relating to the withdrawal of a DNS.

H. The city’s written response under subsection B of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarification or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 90-5 § 2 Exh. A, 1992)

When the city assists the applicant or completes the environmental checklist at the applicant’s request or under EWMC 18.06.120(E), the city shall collect an additional fee equal to the estimated actual cost of providing the assistance.

B. Environmental Impact Statement.

1. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS and the responsible official determines that city employees shall prepare the EIS, the city shall charge and collect a reasonable fee from any applicant to cover costs, including overhead, the city incurs in preparing the EIS.

2. The responsible official may determine that the city will contract directly with a consultant for preparation of an EIS, or a portion of the EIS, for activities initiated by some persons or entity other than the city and may bill such costs and expenses directly to the applicant. Such consultants shall be selected by the city.

3. The applicant shall pay the projected amount to the city prior to commencing work. The city will refund the excess, if any, at the completion of the EIS. If the city’s costs exceed the projected costs, the applicant shall immediately pay the excess. If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the responsible official shall refund any fees collected under subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section which remain after incurred costs, including overhead, are paid.

C. The city shall collect a nonrefundable fee from an applicant to cover the cost of meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the applicant’s proposal. The city council shall set the amount of the nonrefundable fee by resolution.

D. The city may charge any person for copies of any document prepared under this chapter, and for mailing the document, in a manner provided by Chapter 42.17 RCW, as now existing or hereinafter amended.

18.12B.020 Identification and rating.

A. All wetlands shall be identified and delineated in East Wenatchee to reflect the relative function, value and uniqueness of the wetland using the Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual (WDOE, March 1997, as amended); in conjunction with the Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1987, as amended); and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (2006), Interim Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Arid West Region. Wetlands Regulatory Assistance program, Environmental Lab ERDC/EL TRT-06-16, as amended.

B. The following information sources should be used as guidance in identifying the presence of wetlands and the subsequent need for a wetland delineation study:

1. Hydric soils, soils with significant soil inclusions, and “wet spots” identified within the Douglas County soil survey;

2. National Wetlands Inventory;

3. Previous wetland rating evaluation; and

4. On-site inspection.

C. The exact location of the wetland boundary shall be determined by the applicant through the performance of a field investigation applying the wetland definition provided in EWMC 18.12.180(134). A qualified professional shall perform wetland delineations using the Washington State Identification and Delineation Manual. The wetland boundary shall be field staked by the biologist or qualified professional and surveyed by a land surveyor for disclosure on all major subdivision, short plat or binding site plan, maps, etc.

D. The administrator may waive the requirement for the survey for development if:

1. The proposed development is not within 300 feet of the associated wetlands; and

2. There is adequate information available on the area proposed for development to determine the impacts of the proposed development and appropriate mitigating measures.

E. The wetland boundary and any associated buffer area shall be identified on all major subdivision, short plat or binding site plans, maps, plans and specifications submitted for the project.

F. The following system shall be used to rate, establish and administer buffer widths, and replacement ratios for wetlands. For a detailed explanation of this system, refer to Washington State Wetlands Rating System for Eastern Washington – Revised (WDOE 04-06-015, as amended).

1. “Category I wetlands” can be described as the premium wetlands. Generally, these wetlands are not common and would make up a small percentage of the wetlands in the state. These are wetlands that: (a) are very valuable for a particular rare animal species; (b) represent a high quality example of a rare wetland type; (c) are a rare habitat type within a given region; or (d) provide irreplaceable functions and values which are impossible to replace within a human lifetime.

2. “Category II wetlands” occur more commonly than Category I wetlands. They can be described as those wetlands that: (a) provide habitat for very sensitive or important wildlife or plants; (b) are either difficult to replace; or (c) provide very high functions and values, particularly for wildlife habitat.

3. “Category III wetlands” occur more frequently throughout the state than do Category I and Category II wetlands. Generally these wetlands will be smaller, less diverse and/or more isolated than Category II wetlands. These wetlands also provide important functions and values and are important for a variety of wildlife species. These wetlands would be difficult to replace.

4. “Category IV wetlands” are smaller, more isolated and have less diverse vegetation than the other wetland categories. These wetlands do have important values and function, but could be replaced.

5. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter; as the wetland may naturally change thereafter; or as the wetland may change in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland ratings shall not be altered to recognize illegal modifications.

G. An evaluation of any unrated wetland is necessary when there is a proposed development or activity to be located adjacent to, or within an area containing, a wetland. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12B.030 Designation.

Sites classified in accordance with the provisions of EWMC 18.12B.020 are designated as wetlands. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12B.033 Criteria for wetland alterations.

A. Uses and activities may only be allowed in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions, values, and functional performance of the wetland and other critical areas.

B. Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided in this chapter.

C. Type I Wetlands. Activities and uses shall be prohibited in Type I wetlands, except as provided for in the public agency and utility exemptions, reasonable use exceptions, and variances sections of this chapter.

D. Type II and III Wetlands. For uses and activities proposed in Type II and III wetlands, the following standards shall apply:

1. Water-dependent activities may be allowed where there are no practicable alternatives that would have a less adverse impact on the wetland, its buffer and other critical areas.

2. Nonwater-dependent activities are prohibited unless the applicant can demonstrate that:

a. The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished and successfully avoid, or result in less adverse impact on a wetland if the project was located on another site or sites in the vicinity of the proposal; and

b. Alternative designs for the project that would avoid or minimize the potential adverse impact on the wetland or its buffer such as a reduction in the size, scope, or density change in configuration are not feasible.

E. Type IV Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in unavoidable and necessary impacts may be permitted in Type IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area report and mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objective. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12B.035 Wetland management and mitigation plan.

A. A wetland management and mitigation plan shall be required when impacts associated with development within a wetland or wetland buffer are unavoidable, demonstrated by compliance with subsection (G) of this section.

B. Wetland management and mitigation plans shall be prepared by a biologist or qualified professional who is knowledgeable of wetland conditions within North Central Washington.

C. In determining the extent and type of mitigation appropriate for the development, the plan shall evaluate the ecological processes that affect and influence critical area structure, function and value within the watershed or sub-basin; the individual and cumulative effects of the action upon the functions and value of the critical area and associated watershed; and note observed or predicted trends regarding specific wetland types in the watershed, in light of natural and human processes.

D. Where compensatory mitigation is necessary, the plan should seek to implement shoreline restoration objectives identified within the Douglas County Shoreline Restoration Plan.

E. The wetland management and mitigation plan shall demonstrate, when implemented, that there will be no net loss of the ecological function and value of the wetland and buffer area.

F. The wetland management and mitigation plan shall identify how impacts from the proposed project shall be mitigated, as well as the necessary monitoring and contingency actions for the continued maintenance of the wetland and its associated buffer.

G. Mitigation Sequence. When an alteration or impact to a critical area is proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been taken to mitigate impacts in the following prioritized order:

1. Avoiding the adverse impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action, or moving the action.

2. Minimizing adverse impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology and engineering, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce adverse impacts.

3. Rectifying the adverse impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment.

4. Reducing or eliminating the adverse impact over time through preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.

5. Compensating for the adverse impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing similar substitute resources or environments.

6. Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures.

Mitigation for development may include a sequenced combination of the above measures as needed to achieve the most effective protection or compensatory mitigation for critical area functions and values.

H. Mitigation ratios shall be used when impacts to wetlands and/or wetland buffers cannot be avoided. Compensatory mitigation shall restore, create, rehabilitate or enhance equivalent or greater wetland and wetland buffer functions. Mitigation shall be located on site unless the biologist can demonstrate, and the city approves, that on-site mitigation will result in a net loss of ecological function and value. If off-site mitigation measures are determined to be appropriate, off-site mitigation shall be located in the same watershed as the development, within East Wenatchee or Douglas County. The mitigation ratios (mitigation amount : disturbed area) by wetland type and buffer are:

	Wetland Type I	6:1

	Wetland Type II	3:1

	Wetland Type III	2:1

	Wetland Type IV	1.5:1

	Wetland Buffer	1:1

Mitigation within wetland buffers for diverse, high quality habitat or off-site mitigation may require a higher level of mitigation. Wetland management and mitigation plans shall evaluate the need for a higher mitigation ratio on a site by site basis, dependent upon the ecological functions provided by the buffer area. Early consultation with resource agencies is encouraged. Recommendations by resource agencies in evaluating appropriate buffer mitigation shall be considered in the development of mitigation plans.

I. The wetland management and mitigation plan shall contain a report that includes, but is not limited to, the following information:

1. Location maps, regional 1:24,000 and local 1:4,800;

2. A map or maps indicating the boundary delineation of the wetland; the width and length of all existing and proposed structures, utilities, roads, easements; wastewater and stormwater facilities; the total area anticipated to be disturbed and adjacent land uses;

3. A description of the proposed project including the nature, density and intensity of the proposed development and the associated grading, structures, utilities, etc., in sufficient detail to allow analysis of such land use change upon the identified wetland and wetland buffer;

4. A detailed description of vegetative, faunal and hydrologic conditions, soil and substrate characteristics, and topographic features within and surrounding the wetland;

5. A detailed description of vegetative, faunal and hydrologic conditions, soil and substrate characteristics, and topographic features within any compensation site;

6. A detailed description of the proposed project’s effect on the wetland and wetland buffer, and a discussion of any federal, state or local management recommendations which have been developed for the area;

7. A plan which explains how any adverse impacts created by the proposed development will be mitigated to ensure no net loss of ecological function and value. Methods may include, but are not limited to, the following techniques:

a. Establishment of buffer zones;

b. Preservation of critically important plants and trees;

c. Limitation of access to the wetland area;

d. Seasonal restriction of construction activities;

e. Establishment of a monitoring program within the plan;

f. Drainage and erosion control techniques;

g. Direct lights away from the wetland and buffer;

h. Locate facilities that generate substantial noise away from the wetland and buffer;

i. Establish covenants limiting the use of pesticides within 150 feet of the wetland;

j. Implement integrated pest management programs;

k. Post signs at the outer edge of the critical area or buffer to clearly indicate the location of the critical area according to the direction of the city;

l. Plant buffer with native vegetation appropriate for the region to create screens or barriers to noise, light, human intrusion and discourage domestic animal intrusion;

m. Use low impact development where appropriate;

8. A detailed discussion of ongoing management practices which will protect the wetland after the project site has been fully developed, including proposed monitoring, contingency, maintenance and surety programs as provided for in subsection (J) of this section.

9. A narrative which addresses EWMC subsections (A) through (H) this section.

J. The following performance standards shall apply to compensatory mitigation projects:

1. Mitigation planting survival shall be 100 percent for the first year. Any vegetation that does not survive the first year must be replaced consistent with the mitigation planting scheme. The survival rate for successive years shall be at least 80 percent.

2. Mitigation must be installed no later than the next growing season after completion of site improvements, unless otherwise approved by the administrator.

3. Where necessary, a permanent means of irrigation shall be installed for the mitigation planting that is designed by a professional experienced in the design and installation of irrigation systems. The design shall meet the specific needs of the wetland, riparian and shrub steppe vegetation, as may be applicable.

4. A program outlining the approach for monitoring mitigation planting and for assessing a completed project shall be provided. Monitoring reports by the biologist must include verification that the planting areas have less than 20 percent total nonnative/invasive plant cover consisting of exotic and/or invasive species. Exotic and invasive species may include any species on the state noxious weed list which may be referenced on the web at www.wa.gov/agr and www.nwcb.wa.gov, or considered a noxious or problem weed by the Natural Conservation Services Department or local conservation districts.

5. A protocol shall be included in the monitoring program outlining how the monitoring data will be evaluated by agencies that are tracking the progress of the compensation project. A monitoring report shall be submitted annually, at a minimum, documenting milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project. The compensation project shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years. Monitoring reports shall be submitted by a biologist or qualified professional, as defined by this code. The biologist or qualified professional must verify that the conditions of approval and provisions in the wetland management and mitigation plan have been satisfied.

6. Mitigation sites shall be maintained to ensure that the mitigation and management plan objectives are successful. Maintenance shall include corrective actions to rectify problems, include rigorous, as-needed elimination of undesirable plants; protection of shrubs and small trees from competition by grasses and herbaceous plants, and repair and replacement of any dead plants.

7. Prior to site development and/or building permit issuance, a performance surety agreement in conformance with EWMC 18.12.080 must be entered into by the property owner and the city of East Wenatchee. The surety agreement must include the complete costs for the mitigation and monitoring which may include, but not be limited to: the cost of installation, delivery, plant material, soil amendments, permanent irrigation, seed mix, and three monitoring visits and reports by a biologist or qualified professional, including Washington State sales tax. East Wenatchee must approve the estimate for said improvements.

8. Sequential release of funds associated with the surety agreement shall be reviewed for conformance with the conditions of approval and the mitigation and management plan. Release of funds may occur in increments of one-third for substantial conformance with the plan and conditions of approval. If the standards that are not met are only minimally out of compliance and contingency actions are actively being pursued by the property owner to bring the project into compliance, the city may choose to consider a partial release of the scheduled increment. Noncompliance can result in one or more of the following actions: carry over of the surety amount to the next review period; use of funds to remedy the nonconformance; scheduling a hearing with the East Wenatchee hearing body to review conformance with the conditions of approval and to determine what actions may be appropriate. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12B.040 Application requirements.

Development permit applications shall provide appropriate information on forms provided by the review authority, including without limitation the information described in subsections A and B of this section. Additional reports or information to identify potential impacts and mitigation measures to wetlands may be required if deemed necessary.

A. Use of Wetlands and Buffers. Wetlands and wetland buffers will be left undisturbed, unless the development proposal demonstrates that impacts to the wetland and/or buffer are unavoidable, demonstrated by compliance with EWMC 18.12B.035(G). Impacts must be addressed with appropriate mitigation and enhancement measures as determined on a site-specific basis in conformance with EWMC 18.12B.035.

B. Buffers. Appropriate buffer areas shall be maintained between all permitted uses and activities and the designated wetland. Provisions to identify the type of wetland and delineate its boundary are established in EWMC 18.12B.020, and must be conducted by a biologist or qualified professional.

1. The width of a wetland buffer, as measured from the wetland edge established in the approved wetland boundary survey, shall be as follows:

	Wetland Type I	150 feet

	Wetland Type II	100 feet

	Wetland Type III	75 feet

	Wetland Type IV	50 feet

2. Where a wetland is located within a riparian buffer, the buffer width, riparian or wetland, which provides the greatest degree of protection, shall apply.

3. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland edge, as established by the approved wetland boundary survey.

4. All buffer areas shall be temporarily fenced between the construction activity and the buffer with a highly visible and durable protective barrier during construction to prevent access and protect the designated wetland and associated buffer. The review authority may waive this requirement if an alternative to fencing which achieves the same objective is proposed and approved.

5. Except as otherwise allowed, buffers shall be retained in their natural condition. Any habitat created, restored or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall have the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored or enhanced wetland.

6. Land divisions within designated wetland areas shall require a minimum lot frontage along the protective buffer or shoreline as outlined in the Douglas County Regional Shoreline Master Program.

C. Increased Buffer Widths. The width of the buffer may be increased by the review authority for a development project on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect the designated wetland function and value. The determination shall be based on site-specific and project-related conditions which include, without limitation:

1. The designated wetland is used for feeding, nesting and resting by species proposed or listed by the federal or state government as endangered, threatened, sensitive, candidate, monitor or critical; or if it is outstanding potential habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees;

2. The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts;

3. The proposed development adjacent to the designated wetland would be a high intensity land use.

D. General Standards for Wetland Decisions. Approval of modifications to buffers as provided in subsections E, F, and G of this section shall only be granted if, as conditioned, the decision is consistent with the provisions of this chapter including the following:

1. A proposed action avoids adverse impacts to regulated wetlands or their buffers or takes affirmative and appropriate measures to minimize and compensate for unavoidable impacts;

2. The proposed activity results in no net loss to the function and value of the wetland;

3. Denial of a permit would cause an extraordinary hardship on the applicant.

E. Buffer Width Averaging. Standard buffer widths may be modified by the review authority for a development proposal by averaging buffer widths based on a report submitted by the applicant and prepared by a qualified professional approved by the administrator. Buffer width averaging shall only be allowed where the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

1. Averaging is necessary to avoid an extraordinary hardship to the applicant caused by circumstances peculiar to the property;

2. The designated wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation;

3. The width averaging shall not adversely impact the designated wetland’s functional value;

4. The total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging;

5. The minimum buffer width of a Category I or II wetland shall not be reduced by more than 25 percent of the widths established under subsection B of this section; or 75 feet, whichever is greater;

6. The minimum buffer width of a Category III or IV wetland shall not be reduced by more than 50 percent of the widths established under section B of this section; or 50 feet, whichever is greater;

7. The wetland buffer has not been reduced under any other provisions of this chapter; and

8. The variation of buffer widths on a site, via buffer width averaging, must be supported by best available science as demonstrated by the submittal and approval of a wetland management and mitigation plan in conformance with EWMC 18.12B.035.

F. Reduced Buffer Width. The administrator shall have the authority to reduce buffer widths on a case-by-case basis; provided, that the general standards for avoidance and minimization per EWMC 18.12B.035(G) shall apply, and when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator that all of the following criteria have been met:

1. The buffer reduction shall not result in a net loss of function and value of the wetland or wetland buffer.

2. The maximum buffer width reduction allowed shall not exceed 25 percent.

3. The buffer width reduction is contingent upon the submittal and approval of a wetland management and mitigation plan in conformance with EWMC 18.12B.035.

G. Common Line Buffer. A common line wetland buffer may be utilized for the development of a single-family residence on an undeveloped lot, where the lot is located adjacent to existing residential dwelling units on both adjacent shoreline lots. The common line buffer shall be determined by averaging the wetland buffers, as measured landward from the delineated wetland boundary, for each of the adjacent residential dwelling units on the shoreline.

1. Common line buffers shall apply when the width of the undeveloped lot is less than 150 feet;

2. Common line buffers shall not apply when:

a. The elevation of adjacent structures on adjacent lots is 15 feet higher or lower from the natural grade on the vacant center lot.

b. One of the adjacent lots is undeveloped.

c. Either of the adjacent lots has been developed since December 1, 2007.

d. A mitigation and management plan prepared by a biologist or qualified professional shall be submitted and approved which demonstrates no net loss of ecological function and value for the site in conformance with EWMC 18.12B.035.

H. Front Yard Setback Reduction. The administrator shall have the authority to reduce front yard setback standards associated with a public or private roadway, where such a reduction is necessary to avoid or minimize impacts to a wetland or buffer. In no case shall the reduction result in a front yard setback of less than 15 feet. The applicant must demonstrate to the administrator that the following criteria have been met:

1. The reduction in the front yard setback shall be the minimum necessary to address a hardship to the property owner caused by circumstances unique to the property.

2. The standards for avoidance and minimization have been addressed consistent with the provisions of EWMC 18.12B.035(G).

3. The administrator may require the applicant to retain an engineer to verify that the setback reduction will not adversely affect the public safety, where sight distance, roadway speeds, or site topography may be an issue.

4. Vehicular parking and access shall be designed such that no vehicle shall back directly into the road right-of-way, and allow for vehicles to be completely out of structures before entering the road right-of-way. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)

C. If the proposal is found to be complete, accurate, and consistent with the purposes and intent of this chapter and the various goals and objectives of the current comprehensive plan, and the Growth Management Act, the city council will hold a public hearing to solicit comment. Approved nominations will become designated locally important habitats, species, or corridors and will be subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12C.035 Habitat boundary survey.

A. A wildlife habitat boundary survey and evaluation shall be conducted by a fish or wildlife biologist, as appropriate, who is knowledgeable of wildlife habitat within North Central Washington. The wildlife habitat boundary shall be field staked by the biologist and surveyed by a land surveyor for disclosure on all final major subdivision, short plat or binding site plan, maps, etc.

B. The administrator may waive the requirement for the survey for minor development if:

1. The proposed development is not within the management area of the associated wildlife habitat according to available fish and wildlife information;

2. There is adequate information available on the area proposed for development to determine the impacts of the proposed development and appropriate mitigating measures; and

3. The applicant provides voluntary deed restrictions that are approved by the administrator.

C. The wildlife habitat boundary and any associated buffer shall be identified on all major subdivision, short plat or binding site plan, maps, plans and specifications submitted for the project. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12C.037 Fish/wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan.

A. A fish/wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan shall be prepared by a biologist who is knowledgeable of fish and wildlife habitat within North Central Washington.

B. In determining the extent and type of mitigation appropriate for the development, the plan shall evaluate the ecological processes that affect and influence critical area structure and function within the water shed or sub-basin; the individual and cumulative effects of the action upon the function and value of the critical area and associated watershed; and note observed or predicted trends regarding specific wetland types in the watershed, in light of natural and human processes.

C. Where compensatory mitigation is necessary, the plan should seek to implement shoreline restoration objectives identified within the Douglas County Shoreline Restoration Plan.

D. The fish/wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan shall demonstrate, when implemented, no net loss of ecological function and value of the habitat conservation area and buffer.

E. The fish/wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan shall identify how impacts from the proposed project shall be mitigated, as well as the necessary monitoring and contingency actions for the continued maintenance of the habitat conservation area and any associated buffer.

F. Mitigation Sequence. When an alteration or impact to a critical area is proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been taken to mitigate impacts in the following prioritized order:

1. Avoiding the adverse impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action, or moving the action.

2. Minimizing adverse impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology and engineering, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce adverse impacts.

3. Rectifying the adverse impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment.

4. Reducing or eliminating the adverse impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.

5. Compensating for the adverse impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing similar substitute resources or environments and monitoring the adverse impact and the mitigation project and taking appropriate corrective measures.

Mitigation for development may include a sequenced combination of the above measures as needed to achieve the most effective protection or compensatory mitigation for critical area function and value.

G. Mitigation ratios shall be used when impacts to riparian areas, aquatic habitat, and riparian buffers are unavoidable. Compensatory mitigation shall restore, create, rehabilitate or enhance equivalent or greater ecological function and value. Mitigation shall be located on site unless the biologist can demonstrate, and the city approves, that on-site mitigation will result in a net loss of ecological functions. If off-site mitigation measures are determined to be appropriate, off-site mitigation shall be located in the same watershed as the development, within East Wenatchee or Douglas County.

The on-site mitigation ratio shall be at a minimum ratio of 1:1. Mitigation for diverse, high quality habitat or off-site mitigation may require a higher level of mitigation. Mitigation and management plans shall evaluate the need for a higher mitigation ratio on a site by site basis, dependent upon the ecological functions and values provided by the habitat. Recommendations by resource agencies in evaluating appropriate mitigation shall be encouraged.

H. The fish/wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan shall contain a report containing, but not limited to, the following information:

1. Location maps, regional 1:24,000 and local 1:4,800;

2. A map or maps indicating the boundary of the habitat conservation areas; the width and length of all existing and proposed structures, utilities, roads, easements; wastewater and stormwater facilities; and adjacent land uses;

3. A description of the proposed project including the nature, density and intensity of the proposed development and the associated grading, structures, roads, easements, wastewater facilities, stormwater facilities, utilities, etc., in sufficient detail to allow analysis of such land use change upon the habitat conservation area;

4. A detailed discussion of surface and subsurface hydrologic features both on and adjacent to the site where the review authority determines appropriate;

5. A description of the vegetation in the habitat conservation area, on the overall project site and adjacent to the site;

6. A detailed description of the proposed project’s effect on the habitat conservation area, and a discussion of any federal, state or local management recommendations which have been developed for the species or habitats in the area;

7. A plan, by the applicant, which explains how any adverse impacts created by the proposed development will be mitigated to ensure no net loss of ecological function and value. Methods may include, but are not limited to, the following techniques:

a. Establishment of buffer zones;

b. Preservation of critically important plants and trees;

c. Limitation of access to the habitat conservation area;

d. Seasonal restriction of construction activities;

1. Mitigation planting survival will be 100 percent for the first year, and 80 percent for each of the four years following.

2. Mitigation must be installed no later than the next growing season after completion of site improvements, unless otherwise approved by the administrator.

3. Where necessary, a permanent means of irrigation shall be installed for the mitigation planting that is designed by a professional experienced in the design and installation of irrigation systems. The design shall meet the specific needs of riparian and shrub steppe vegetation.

4. Monitoring reports by the biologist must include verification that the planting areas have less than 20 percent total nonnative/invasive plant cover consisting of exotic and/or invasive species. Exotic and invasive species may include any species on the state noxious weed list which may be referenced on the web at www.wa.gov/agr and www.nwcb.wa.gov, or considered a noxious or problem weed by the Natural Conservation Services Department or local conservation districts.

5. On-site monitoring and monitoring reports shall be submitted to East Wenatchee community development department one year after mitigation installation; three years after mitigation installation; and five years after mitigation installation. Monitoring reports shall be submitted by a biologist or qualified professional, as defined by EWMC 18.12.180.

6. Mitigation sites shall be maintained to ensure that the mitigation and management plan objectives are successful. Maintenance shall include corrective actions to rectify problems, include rigorous, as-needed elimination of undesirable plants; protection of shrubs and small trees from competition by grasses and herbaceous plants, and repair and replacement of any dead plants.

7. Sequential release of funds associated with the surety agreement shall be reviewed for conformance with the conditions of approval and the mitigation and management plan. Release of funds may occur in increments of one-third for substantial conformance with the plan and conditions of approval. If the standards that are not met are only minimally out of compliance and contingency actions are actively being pursued by the property owner to bring the project into compliance, the city may choose to consider a partial release of the scheduled increment. Noncompliance can result in one or more of the following actions: carry over of the surety amount to the next review period; use of funds to remedy the nonconformance; scheduling a hearing with the East Wenatchee hearing body to review conformance with the conditions of approval and to determine what actions may be appropriate.

8. Prior to site development and or building permit issuance, a performance surety agreement in conformance with EWMC 18.12.080 must be entered into by the property owner and East Wenatchee. The surety agreement must include the complete costs for the mitigation and monitoring which may include, but not be limited to: the cost of installation, delivery, plant material, soil amendments, permanent irrigation, seed mix, and three monitoring visits and reports by a biologist or qualified professional, including Washington State sales tax. East Wenatchee must approve the estimate for said improvements. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)

C. Appropriate buffer areas shall be maintained between all permitted uses and activities and designated habitat conservation areas.

1. All buffers shall be measured from the habitat edge, as established by the approved habitat boundary survey. Riparian buffers shall be measured as provided for in subsection (B)(6) of this section.

2. All buffer areas shall be temporarily fenced between the construction activity and the buffer with a highly visible and durable protective barrier during construction to prevent access and protect the designated habitat conservation area and associated buffer. The review authority may waive this requirement if an alterative to fencing which achieves the same objective is proposed and approved.

3. Except as otherwise allowed, buffers shall be retained in their natural condition. Any habitat created, restored or enhanced as compensation for approved habitat alterations shall have the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored or enhanced habitat.

4. The width of the buffer may be increased by the review authority for a development project on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect the designated habitat conservation area function and value. The determination shall be based on site-specific and project-related conditions, which include without limitation:

a. The designated habitat conservation area is used for feeding, nesting and resting by species proposed or listed by the federal or state government as endangered, threatened, sensitive, candidate, monitor or critical; or if it is an outstanding potential habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees;

b. The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse habitat impacts;

c. The proposed development adjacent to the designated habitat conservation area would be a high intensity land use.

5. Standard buffer widths may be modified by the review authority for a development proposal by averaging buffer widths based on a report, submitted by the applicant and prepared by a qualified professional approved by the administrator (e.g., wildlife biologist), and shall only be allowed where the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

a. Averaging is necessary to avoid an extraordinary hardship to the applicant caused by circumstances peculiar to the property;

b. The designated habitat conservation area contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation;

c. The width averaging shall not adversely impact the designated habitat conservation area’s function and value;

d. The total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging;

e. Off-site mitigation is required if the buffer area is smaller than normally required in order to accommodate small lot sizes or other special conditions;

f. For riparian buffers, the minimum buffer width shall not be less than 50 percent of the widths established under subsection (C)(6) of this section or 25 feet, whichever is greater; and

g. For riparian buffers, the buffer has not been reduced under any other provision of this chapter.

h. The variation of buffer widths on a site, via buffer width averaging, must be supported by best available science as demonstrated by the submittal and approval of a fish and wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan in conformance with EWMC 18.12C.037.

6. The administrator shall have the authority to reduce buffer widths on a case-by-case basis; provided, that the general standards for avoidance and minimization per EWMC 18.12C.037(F) shall apply, and when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator that all of the following criteria have been met:

a. The buffer reduction shall not adversely affect the habitat function and value of the riparian area or other critical area.

b. The maximum buffer width reduction allowed shall not exceed 25 percent.

c. The buffer width reduction is contingent upon the submittal and approval of a fish and wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan in conformance with EWMC 18.12C.037.

7. The administrator shall have the authority to reduce front yard setback standards associated with a public or private roadway, where such as reduction is necessary to avoid or minimize impacts to a habitat area or buffer. In no case shall the reduction result in a front yard setback of less than 15 feet. The applicant must demonstrate to the administrator that the following criteria have been met:

a. The reduction in the front yard setback shall be the minimum necessary to address extraordinary hardship to the property owner caused by circumstances unique to the property.

b. The standards for avoidance and minimization have been addressed consistent with the provisions of EWMC 18.12C.037(F).

c. The administrator may require the applicant to retain an engineer to verify that the setback reduction will not adversely affect the public safety; where sight distance, roadway speeds, or site topography may be an issue.

d. Vehicular parking and access shall be designed such that no vehicle shall back directly into the road right-of-way, and allow for vehicles to be completely out of structures before entering road right-of-way.

8. A common line riparian buffer may be utilized for the development of a single-family residence on an undeveloped lot, where the lot is located adjacent to existing residential dwelling units on both adjacent shoreline lots. The common line buffer shall be determined by; averaging the riparian buffers, as measured landward from the ordinary high water mark, for each of the adjacent residential dwelling units on the shoreline.

a. Common line buffers shall apply when:

i. The width of the undeveloped lot is less than 150 feet;

b. Common line buffers shall not apply when:

i. The elevation of adjacent structures on adjacent lots is 15 feet higher or lower from the natural grade on the vacant center lot.

E. Developments authorized within a designated habitat conservation area or buffer shall comply with the following minimum standards:

1. A habitat management and mitigation plan shall be required.

2. Designated habitat conservation areas and their associated buffers shall be delineated and disclosed on final major subdivision, short plat or binding site plan, maps, documents, etc., as critical area tracts, nonbuildable lots, buffer areas or common areas. Ownership and control may be transferred to a homeowner’s association or designated as an easement or covenant encumbering the property.

3. All lots within a major subdivision, short plat or binding site plan shall have the outer edge of all required buffers clearly marked on site with permanent buffer edge markers. Buffer markers may be either buffer signs or steel posts painted with a standard color and label, as approved by the administrator. The markers shall be field verified by the surveyor or biologist of record prior to final major subdivision, short plat or binding site plan approval. Each lot shall contain a minimum of three buffer area markers located at the landward edge of the buffer perimeter for each habitat type; one located at each side property line and one midway between side property lines. Covenants for the subdivision shall incorporate a requirement stating that buffer area markers shall not be removed, or relocated, except as a may be approved by the administrator.

F. View Corridors. The development or maintenance of view corridors can provide the general public and property owners of single-family residences opportunities for visual access to water bodies associated with shoreline lots. One view corridor may be permitted per lot, when consistent with the provisions of this chapter. A mitigation and management plan consistent with EWMC 18.12C.037 must be submitted for review and approval; either with a complete building permit application for a new single-family residence or associated with an existing single-family residence.

1. In addition to the submittal of a complete mitigation and management plan, an applicant must submit the following materials:

a. A signed East Wenatchee master application form by the property owner of the shoreline proposed for vegetation alterations.

b. A scaled graphic which demonstrates a side, top and bottom parameter for the view corridor with existing vegetation and proposed alterations. The view corridor shall be limited to 25 percent of the width of the lot, or 25 feet, whichever distance is less.

c. A graphic and/or site photos for the entire shoreline frontage which demonstrates that the homesite and proposed or existing home does or will not when constructed have a view corridor of the water body, taking into account site topography and the location of shoreline vegetation on the parcel.

d. Demonstration that the applicant does not have an existing or proposed shoreline access corridor or dock access corridor.

2. Applications for view corridors must be consistent with the following standards:

a. Native vegetation removal shall be prohibited.

b. Pruning of native vegetation shall not exceed 30 percent of a tree’s limbs, and shrubs shall not be pruned to a height less than six feet. No tree topping shall occur.

c. Nonnative trees should be preserved unless the mitigation and management plan demonstrates that the species or location would be detrimental to the functions and values of the habitat or pose a hazard to public safety.

d. Nonnative vegetation within a view corridor may be removed when the mitigation and management plan can demonstrate a net gain in site functions, and where impacts are mitigated at a ratio of 2:1.

e. Whenever possible, view corridors shall be located in areas dominated with nonnative vegetation and invasive species.

f. Pruning shall be done in a manner that shall ensure the continued survival of vegetation.

g. The applicant’s biologist shall clearly establish that fragmentation of fish and wildlife habitat will not occur, and that there is not a net loss of site ecological functions.

G. Shoreline Restoration/Shoreline Access. Shoreline restoration of degraded or limited function shoreline areas shall be encouraged consistent with the Douglas County Shoreline Restoration Plan. Where appropriate, opportunities for enhanced shoreline access, use and enjoyment may be offered as incentives to shoreline property owners to restore or enhance the functions of shoreline habitat. Access corridors provide physical access to the shoreline and water.

For this section, the access corridor and restoration applies to that portion of the shoreline zone that falls within the riparian buffer. The application of this section is to limited functioning shorelines and is not appropriate for shorelines with diverse habitat or functions. Shoreline restoration and access plans must address the following standards and provide the following application materials:

1. A fish/wildlife habitat management and mitigation plan shall be prepared pursuant to EWMC 18.12C.037 for the access corridor and restoration plan. The mitigation plan shall demonstrate that the proposed restoration plan shall result in a net increase in function of the shoreline.

2. Where consistent with the provisions of this chapter, access corridors within the buffer may be permitted through the implementation of a restoration plan. The restoration plan would provide mitigation for the installation of the access corridor (lawn grass) within the buffer. The access corridor shall be installed in such a manner that prevents erosion and provides no net loss of functions and values of the shoreline.

3. Access corridors and restoration may only be implemented along shorelines where the existing function of the shoreline will not be decreased and the implementation of the restoration plan would result in a net increase in function. This includes disturbed shoreline as well as low functioning undisturbed shorelines that can be significantly improved by the implementation of a restoration plan consisting of trees, shrubs and groundcover. This subsection is not appropriate for high functioning shorelines.

4. Access corridors shall be designed to provide access through the buffer to an area where an existing use occurs (docks, boatlifts, swim areas, etc.). If no existing use is established, the access corridor shall take into account the existing native vegetation, shoreline slope, and any proposed uses (dock). The installation of an access corridor and restoration action shall avoid removing native vegetation, which shall be maintained and incorporated into the restoration planting plan. Developed shoreline restoration/access sites approved pursuant to this code, are not eligible for view corridor provisions identified in subsection F of this section.

5. The access corridors shall be permitted at the same time as other shoreline permits whenever possible.

6. The width of the access corridor shall be tapered to 10 feet within the first 25 percent of the riparian buffer, measured landward of the ordinary high water mark of the shoreline of the subject property. The intent is for the shoreline restoration design to provide for significant blocks of habitat in close proximity to the shoreline; avoiding areas of existing native vegetation; and tapering use areas at the widest point to the landward edge of the buffer area.

7. No structures shall be constructed within the lawn grass. Lawn grass may extend to within five feet of the ordinary high water mark, as long as it can be installed in such a manner that prevents erosion. The use of pesticides and fertilizers shall not be permitted within 50 feet of the ordinary high water mark.

8. Mitigation (restoration plan) for the access corridor shall be provided through the planting of native vegetation within the buffer. The area of the buffer that shall be available for the access corridor and the restoration area shall be only that area that is devoid of native vegetation. Within this area that is devoid of native vegetation the ratio of mitigation to lawn grass shall be 2:1. In most cases the access corridor and the restoration plan shall not encompass the entire buffer, as some native riparian and shrub steppe species occur on most properties.

9. Prior to work on the property, the biologist of record shall verify that the boundaries of disturbance have clearly been demarcated by silt fencing straw bales or other approved temporary erosion and sediment control device. Written verification from the biologist of record shall be required prior to work commencing.

10. Areas designated for restoration shall be cleared and grubbed and deconsolidated to a depth of at least 10 inches. “Clearing and grubbing” is defined as the removal of plant material, including the roots, which entails minimal ground disturbance. Restoration areas soils shall be tested prior to planting to determine if soil amendments will be required. Soil testing shall be verified by invoices from the installing contractor. Importing of gravel and/or soil amendments shall also be subject to approval from the Chelan County PUD, if such importing occurs waterward of the Exhibit G or K line.

11. Native planting within the restoration area shall be planted with trees (spaced 10 feet on center), shrubs (spaced three to five feet on center based on shrub size) and groundcover (grasses, forbes, etc.). The restoration plan must contain all three layers of vegetation and include both riparian and shrub steppe species.

12. Species composition shall be determined based on the size of the restoration area. For areas less than 500 square feet, a minimum of two species of trees and four species of shrubs shall be installed. For areas between 500 and 2,000 square feet, a minimum of three species of trees and six species of shrubs shall be installed. For areas greater than 2,000 square feet, a minimum of four species of trees and eight species of shrubs shall be installed. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12C.070 Variances.

Applicants who are unable to comply with the specific dimensional or performance standards of this chapter may seek approval pursuant to the variance standards of the this section. The procedures for the processing of a variance under this section shall be as established under Chapter 17.88 EWMC, as amended; as a quasi-judicial review application before the East Wenatchee hearing body. The burden of proof shall rest with the applicant to prove by clear, cogent and convincing evidence all of the following elements:

A. The strict application of the dimensional or performance standards set forth in this chapter precludes a reasonable permitted use of the property;

B. The hardship asserted by the applicant is specifically related to the property and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape or size, topography, physical features, location or surroundings over which the applicant has no control;

C. The hardship asserted by the applicant results from the application of this chapter to the property and not the result of deed restrictions or the actions of the applicant or owner;

D. The requested variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by other properties in the same neighborhood or district, and is the minimum relief necessary for the preservation of a property right substantially the same as possessed by owners of property in the same neighborhood or district;

E. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the purposes of this chapter, be injurious to property in the same neighborhood or district in which the property is located, cause substantial adverse impact on the public interest or be otherwise detrimental to the objectives of the comprehensive plan;

F. The project includes mitigation for unavoidable critical area and buffer impacts, consistent with the requirements of EWMC 18.12C.037;

G. The applicant can clearly demonstrate compliance with the avoidance and minimization standards established in EWMC 18.12C.037(F). (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12C.080 Action on variances.

The hearing body or zoning adjustor may approve, conditionally approve or deny a request for a variance. The hearing body may, in granting a variance, establish conditions determined necessary to:

A. Protect the interests of surrounding properties and the general public health, safety, welfare and interest;

B. Accomplish the objectives and intent of this chapter, other applicable regulations and the comprehensive plan; and

C. Mitigate potential adverse impacts of the proposal.

D. The hearing body shall establish a date by which site development must commence. Development which does not commence within this time frame must submit a new application and fees in accordance with the codes in place at the time of a new complete application submittal. A maximum two-year time period shall be established; with the ability of the administrator to grant a one-year extension prior to the termination of the two-year period. The one-year extension must be based upon hardship demonstrated by the applicant that is not in the applicant’s control. The hearing body may authorize a longer period based upon good cause, demonstrated by the applicant. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)

18.12D.010 Permitted uses and activities.

Uses and activities allowed within designated geologically hazardous areas are those uses permitted by the zoning district, subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12D.020 Classification.

A. All geologically hazardous areas shall be classified by the city of East Wenatchee according to the level of risk associated with the hazardous area as established through an approved geologic hazard risk assessment and/or a geotechnical report submitted by the applicant in accordance with this code. The city of East Wenatchee may use on-site inspections and the information sources identified in EWMC 18.12.040 as guidance in identifying the presence of potential geologically hazardous areas.

B. Geologically hazardous areas in the city of East Wenatchee shall be classified according to the following system:

1. Known or suspected risk;

2. No risk; and

3. Risk unknown.

C. Any land containing soils, geology or slopes that meet any of the following criteria shall be classified as having a known or suspected risk of being geologically hazardous areas:

1. Areas identified by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard.

2. Areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include any areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Example of these may include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Areas of historic failures, such as:

i. Those areas delineated by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development;

ii. Those areas mapped as class U (unstable), UOS (unstable old slides), and URS (unstable recent slides) in the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas; or

iii. Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published as the United States Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources division of geology and earth resources;

b. Areas with all three of the following characteristics:

i. Slopes steeper than 15 percent;

ii. Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and

iii. Springs or groundwater seepage;

c. Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch or which are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;

d. Slopes that are parallel or sub-parallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials;

e. Slopes having gradients steeper than 80 percent subject to rockfall during seismic shaking;

f. Areas potentially unstable as a result of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;

g. Areas that show evidence of, or are at risk from, snow avalanches;

h. Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; and

i. Any area with a slope of 45 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least 10 feet of vertical relief.

3. Areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake-induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by:

a. The magnitude of an earthquake;

b. The distance from the source of an earthquake;

c. The type of thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and

d. The type of subsurface geologic structure.

4. Other geological events:

a. Volcanic hazard areas shall include areas subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows, debris avalanche, inundation by debris flows, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from volcanic activity.

b. Mine hazard areas are those areas underlain by, adjacent to, or affected by mine workings such as adits, gangways, tunnels, drifts, or airshafts.

All existing areas of the city of East Wenatchee classified as stated in EWMC 18.12D.020, as determined by the review authority, are designated as geologically hazardous areas. (Ord. 08-02 § 3, 2008)


18.12D.040 Determination process – Geologically hazardous area.

The city of East Wenatchee shall review each development permit application to determine if the provisions of this chapter shall be initiated. In making the determination, the city may use any resources identified in EWMC 18.12.040, as well as any previously completed special reports conducted in the vicinity of the subject proposal. The following progressive steps shall occur upon a determination by the city that a geologically hazardous area may exist on a site proposed for a development permit:

A. Step One. The city of East Wenatchee staff shall determine if there is any possible geologically hazardous areas on site designated by EWMC 18.12D.030. This determination shall be made following a review of information available and a site inspection if appropriate. If no hazard area is determined to be present, this chapter shall not apply to the review of the proposed development.

B. Step Two. If it is determined that a geologically hazardous area may be present, the applicant shall submit a geologic hazard area risk assessment prepared by a qualified professional engineer or a geologist. The risk assessment shall include a description of the geology of the site and the proposed development; an assessment of the potential impact the project may have on the geologic hazard; an assessment of what potential impact the geologic hazard may have on the project; appropriate mitigation measures, if any; and a conclusion as to whether further analysis is necessary. The assessment shall be signed by and bear the seal of the engineer or geologist that prepared it. No further analysis shall be required if the geologic hazard area risk assessment concludes that there is no geologic hazard present on the site, nor will the project affect or be affected by any potential geologic hazards that may be nearby.

C. Step Three. If the qualified professional preparing the risk assessment in step two concludes that further analysis is necessary, the applicant shall submit a geotechnical report consistent with the provisions of EWMC 18.12.120.

D. The geotechnical report shall include a certification from the engineer preparing the report, including the engineer’s professional stamp and signature, stating all of the following:

1. The risk of damage from the project, both on and off site is minimal;

2. The project will not materially increase the risk of occurrence of the hazard; and

3. The specific measures incorporated into the design and operational plan of the project to eliminate or reduce the risk of damage due to the hazard. All mitigation measures, construction techniques, recommendations and technical specifications provided in the geotechnical report shall be applied during the implementation of the proposal. The engineer of record shall submit sealed verification at the conclusion of construction that development occurred in conformance with the approved plans.

E. A proposed development cannot be approved if it is determined by the geotechnical report that either the proposed development or adjacent properties will be at risk of damage from the geologic hazard, or that the project will increase the risk of occurrence of the hazard, and there are no adequate mitigation measures to alleviate the risks.

4. Provide for prompt and coordinated review by government agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan or development regulation level.

B. In its review of a project permit application, the city may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan and/or in other applicable local, state or federal laws provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the application.

C. If the city’s comprehensive plans, subarea plans and development regulations adequately address a project’s specific adverse environmental impacts, as determined under subsections A and B of this section, it shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review.

D. A comprehensive plan, subarea plan, development regulation or other applicable local, state or federal law permits adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of an application when:

1. The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or

2. The city has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards or other land use planning required or allowed by Chapter 36.70A RCW.

E. In its decision whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction and with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the city shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. Any oral consultation shall be documented in the project permit file. In making this deferral, the city shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.

F. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided by Chapter 43.21C RCW.

G. The city shall also review the application under Chapter 18.06 EWMC, the city environmental policy ordinance. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.04.030 Categorically exempt and planned actions.

A. Categorically Exempt. Actions categorically exempt under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) do not require environmental review or the preparation of an environmental impact statement. An action that is categorically exempt under the rules adopted by the Department of Ecology (Chapter 197-11 WAC) may not be conditioned or denied under SEPA.

B. Planned Actions.

1. A planned action does not require a threshold determination or the preparation of an environmental impact statement under SEPA, but is subject to environmental review and mitigation under SEPA.

2. A “planned action” means one or more types of project action that:

a. Are designated planned actions by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the city;

b. Have had the significant impacts adequately addressed in an environmental impact statement prepared in conjunction with:

(1) A comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, or

(2) A fully contained community, a master planned resort, a master planned development or a phased project;

c. Are subsequent or implementing projects for the proposals listed in subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section;

d. Are located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030;

C. Limitations on Planned Actions. The city shall limit planned actions to certain types of development or to specific geographical areas that are less extensive than the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, and may limit a planned action to a time period identified in the environmental impact statement or in the ordinance or resolution designating the planned action under RCW 36.70A.040.

D. Limitations on SEPA Review. During project reviews, the city shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in EWMC 19.04.010(B), except for issues of code interpretation. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as but not limited to, the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal’s probable adverse environmental impacts. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)

19.05.010 General.

Open record public hearings on all Type II, III and IV project permit applications, shall be conducted in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.05.020 Responsibility of director for hearing.

The director shall:

A. Schedule an application for review and public hearing;

B. Give notice;

C. Prepare the staff report on the application, which shall be a single report stating all of the decisions made as of the date of the report, including recommendations on project permits in the consolidated permit process that do not require an open record predecision hearing. The report shall state any mitigation required or proposed under the development regulations or the city’s authority under SEPA. If the threshold determination other than a determination of significance has not been issued previously by the city, the report shall include or append this determination. In the case of a Type I or II project permit application, this report may be the permit;

D. Prepare the notice of decision, if required by the hearing body and/or mail a copy of the notice of decision to those required by this code to receive such decision. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.05.030 Conflict of interest. 

The hearing body shall be subject to the code of ethics and prohibitions on conflict of interest as set forth in RCW 35A.42.020 and Chapter 42.23 RCW, as the same now exist or as may be hereafter amended. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.05.040 Ex parte communications.

A. Quasi-judicial land use decisions of the hearing body shall be subject to Chapter 42.36 RCW, Appearance of Fairness, as the same now exists or as may be hereafter amended.

B. No member of the hearing body may be disqualified by the appearance of fairness doctrine for conducting the business of his or her office with any constituent on any matter other than a quasi-judicial action then pending before the hearing body.

C. Prior to declaring as a candidate for public office or while campaigning for public office as defined by RCW 42.17.020(5) and (25), as now exist or as may be hereafter amended, no public discussion or expression of an opinion by a person subsequently elected to a public office, on any pending or proposed quasi-judicial actions, shall be a violation of the appearance of fairness doctrine.

D. During the pendency of any quasi-judicial proceeding, no member of a decision-making body may engage in ex parte communications with opponents or proponents with respect to the proposal which is the subject of the proceeding unless that person:

1. Places on the record the substance of any written or oral ex parte communications concerning the decision or action;

2. Provides that a public announcement of the content of the communication and of the parties’ rights to rebut the substance of the communication shall be made at each hearing where action is considered or taken on the subject to which the communication related. This prohibition does not preclude a member of a decision-making body from seeking in a public hearing specific information or date from such parties relative to the decision if both the request and the results are a part of the record. Nor does such prohibition preclude correspondence between a citizen and his or her elected official if any such correspondence is made a part of the record when it pertains to the subject matter of a quasi-judicial proceeding.

E. Anyone seeking to rely on the appearance of fairness doctrine to disqualify a member of a decision-making body from participating in a decision must raise the challenge as soon as the basis for disqualification is made known to the individual. Where the basis is known or should reasonably have been known prior to the issuance of a decision and is not raised, it may not be relied on to invalidate the decision.

F. In the event of a challenge to a member or members of the hearing body which would cause a lack of a quorum or would result in a failure to obtain a majority vote as required by law, any such challenged member(s) shall be permitted to fully participate in the proceeding and vote as though the challenge had not occurred, if the member or members publicly disclose the basis for disqualification prior to rendering a decision. Such participation shall not subject the decision to a challenge by reason of violation of the appearance of fairness doctrine.

G. Except for Type V actions, a member absent during the presentation of evidence in a hearing may not participate in the deliberations or decision unless the member has reviewed the evidence received. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.05.050 Burden and nature of proof.

Except for Type V actions, the burden of proof for demonstrating compliance with development regulations and consistency with SEPA is on the applicant. The project permit application must be supported by proof that it conforms to the applicable elements of the city’s development regulations, comprehensive plan and that any significant adverse environmental impacts have been adequately addressed. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.05.060 Order of proceedings.

D. The hearing body may view the area in dispute with or without notification to the parties, but shall place the time, manner and circumstances of such view on the record.

E. Information shall be received from the staff and from proponents and opponents. The presiding officer may approve or deny a request from a person attending the hearing to ask a question.

F. When the presiding officer has closed the public hearing portion of the hearing, the hearing body shall openly discuss the issue and may further question a person submitting information or the staff if opportunity for rebuttal is provided. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)

Where amendments to both a plan and development regulations are suggested, or where an amendment to the comprehensive plan would be implemented by an amendment to the development regulations, Such amendments may be considered concurrently. (Ord. 96-5 § 1, 1996)


19.08.070 Public participation.

The public shall be made aware of the opportunity to suggest amendments and to comment on suggested amendments through methods including, but not limited to direct mailings, newsletter and newspaper articles, legal advertisements, and notices posted in public places.
