11-4-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of a conditional use permit is to allow a land use that, because of its unique characteristics or potential impact on the municipality, surrounding neighbors, or
adjacent land uses, may be compatible only if certain conditions are required that mitigate the detrimental impacts. This chapter governs the process by which all new and
existing conditional uses are reviewed; the review process for permitted uses is outlined in chapter 5 of this title. As outlined in Utah State Code section 10-9a-507, the
land use authority shall approval a conditional use if reasonable conditions are proposed, or can be imposed, to mitigate the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of
the proposed use in accordance with applicable standards. If the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of a proposed conditional use cannot be substantially mitigated
by the proposal or imposition of reasonable conditions to achieve compliance with applicable standards, the land use authority may deny the conditional use. Review of a
conditional use permit by the land use authority is an administrative action.
11-4-2: REQUIRED:
A conditional use permit shall be required for all uses listed as conditional uses in the zone regulations or as elsewhere in this title. The conditional use permit review shall
include the review of all applicable plans and documents as listed on the official conditional use permit checklist. All new construction of conditional uses shall be
processed as a conditional use permit. A conditional use permit may be revoked upon failure to comply with conditions precedent to the original approval of the permit.
11-4-3: PROCEDURES:
A. Application: Application for a conditional use permit shall be made in writing on forms prepared by the planning and zoning administrator by the property owner or
registered agent. Upon receipt of a complete application, the planning and zoning administrator shall schedule the application for consideration by the planning
commission. The planning and zoning administrator shall not place any application on the planning commission agenda until all items required by this title have been
submitted or are omitted for good cause.
B. Information And Items Required: Detailed site plan, location, landscaping, and building plans shall accompany an application for a conditional use permit as outlined
on the official conditional use permit checklist and as appropriate. Information sufficient to demonstrate that the general and specific requirements of this title will be
met by the construction and operation of the proposed building, structure or use shall be submitted with the application.

2. The City inspectors will review all plans to ensure that unprotected cross-connections are not part of the consumer's water system. If a cross-connection
cannot be eliminated, it must be protected by the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly or device.
3. Water vacating the drinking water supply must do so by an approved and properly installed and maintained air gap or backflow prevention assembly or
device.
D. Certified Tester/Technician or Repair Person:
1. Whether employed by the consumer or a utility to survey, test, repair or maintain backflow prevention assemblies, the certified backflow technicians,
surveyors or repair persons will have the following responsibilities:
a. Ensuring approved testing equipment and procedures are used for testing and repairing backflow prevention assemblies.
b. Make reports of such testing and/or repair to the consumer and Clearfield City Public Works.
c. All test reports shall include a description of the assembly tested (including type, size, model and serial numbers), the physical address, a
description of the location of the assembly, contact information for the tester and owner of the assembly, the results of the test and a list of
materials or replacement parts used.
d. Ensuring replacement parts are equal in quality to parts originally supplied by the manufacturer of the assembly being repaired.
e. Not changing the design, material or operational characteristics of the assembly during testing, repair or maintenance.
f. A certified technician shall perform all tests of the mechanical devices or assemblies and be responsible for accuracy of all tests and reports.
g. Ensuring the license is current, and that testing equipment being used is acceptable to the State and is in proper operating
condition.
h. Be equipped with and be certified or licensed to use, all necessary tools, gauges and other equipment to properly test and maintain backflow
prevention assemblies.
2. All tests of assemblies must be conducted by a person certified by the State Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Drinking Water. All repairs
must be made by an appropriately licensed person.
9-2-4: REQUIREMENTS:
A. Protection of Water Supply: No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by Clearfield City’s water system unless the water supply is
protected as required by State laws, regulations, codes and this Chapter. Water service shall be discontinued by the City after a written notification of violation has been
issued and a 10 calendar day period has been given for compliance, if:
1. A backflow prevention assembly required by this Chapter for control of backflow and cross-connections is not installed, tested and maintained; or
2. If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or bypassed; or
3. If an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises; or
4. If the periodic system survey has not been allowed as requested by a City official.
Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. Nothing in subsection 9-2-4(A) shall be interpreted to limit the authority of the City to
discontinue service as outlined in section 9-2-5 of this chapter.
B. Inspection of Customer's System: The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the City to determine
whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation of this Chapter exist and to audit the results of the required survey (subsection 9-2-
3A2 of this Chapter).
C. Installation of Approved Prevention Assembly: Whenever the City deems a service connection's water usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an
approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified consumer's water system, at or near the property line, or immediately inside
the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 10/359
D. Type of Protective Assembly: The type of protective assembly required under subsection C of this Section, shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists at the
point of cross-connection (whether direct or indirect), applicable to local and State requirements resulting from the required survey.
E. Previously-Approved Assemblies: All presently-installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this Section but were approved
assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except for the inspection and maintenance
requirements under subsection F of this Section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the City is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the City
water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the City finds that the operation
or maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the local and State
requirements.
F. Testing and Maintenance Requirements: It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at the premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have
certified operational tests made annually at the consumer's expense. In those instances where the Water Superintendent deems the hazard to be great, the City may require
certified operational tests at a more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the Water Superintendent to see that these tests are made according to the standards set forth
by the State of Utah, Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Drinking Water.
G. Testing Backflow Prevention Assemblies: All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10) working days of initial installation, replacement or
repairs.
H. Safety Hazards: No backflow prevention assembly shall be installed so as to create a safety hazard. Example: installed over any electrical panel, steam pipes, boilers,
pits or above ceiling level.
9-2-5: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:
If a violation of this Chapter exists or if there has not been any corrective action taken by the consumer within ten (10) days of the written notification of deficiencies
noted within the survey, then the City shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break in the service line until the customer
has corrected the conditions in conformance with the State and City statutes relating to plumbing, safe drinking water supplies and the regulations adopted, and the
customer will be assessed a reconnection fee to restore service thereto. Water service may be discontinued immediately if, as determined by the Water Superintendent, or
designee, that an incident has or may occur that compromises the public health and safety of others or the public water supply based on a real contamination or a risk of
contamination to the public water supply.
Section 2. Repealer: Any provision or ordinances that are in conflict with this ordinance are hereby repealed.
Section 3. Effective Date: These amendments shall become effective immediately upon passage and posting.
Passed and adopted by the Clearfield City Council this 13th day of November, 2018.

embarrassment in the subject of that record, in accordance with accepted standards of social propriety, shall generally not be classified as public

established by this chapter, certain items of data may be rendered nonpublic, although other items of data in the record, or the record itself, may be
classified public.

notify the subject of the record that a request for access to the subject's records has been made.

conducted under the supervision of the records officer who shall be assisted by a classification review committee consisting of the records officer, the city
manager and theagency director of the agency in charge of the record in question. Assistance may be requested from the city attorney as needed.
Classification and retention scheduling forms and guidelines shall be prepared and promulgated by the records officer. The city shall establish a retention
schedule for all city records and record series. The initial retention schedule shall be as set forth in appendix A attached to the ordinance codified herein
and on file in the office of the records officer. (Ord. 2006-16, 10-24-2006)
1-10-12: PROCEDURES FOR RECORDS REQUEST:

determined by the city or the agency director. Extraordinary circumstances shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

B. Review Not Subject To Fee: The city may not charge a fee for reviewing a record to determine whether it is subject to disclosure or for inspecting a
record. (Ord. 2006-16, 10-24-2006)

fee will be due and payable.
B. Enforcement Official To Direct Inspections: It is the duty of the enforcement official who issued the notice of violation or an authorized designee to
perform or cause to be performed any and all compliance inspections.

issued.

with a written explanation setting forth the reasons for the denial.

requested inspection is in error and that the inspection should have resulted in a notice of compliance, that person may request a Code enforcement
hearing to challenge the inspection result.
G. Effect Of Code Enforcement Order: If a Code enforcement order upholds some but not all violations described in a notice of violation, such an order has
the effect of amending the notice of violation as to any further inspections or reviews, and any future requests for a notice of compliance.

rebutted, that the violation is continuing if no inspection or review is requested.

purpose and intent of the City to afford due process of law to any person who is directly affected by a Code enforcement action. Due process of law

to establish a forum to efficiently, expeditiously, and fairly review and resolve issues raised in any notice of violation.

and the Hearing Officer will schedule a date, time, and place for the hearing, and will serve written notice of the same to all responsible persons.
3. Failure to timely request a hearing as provided shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and a waiver of the right to challenge the City's
action set out in the notice of violation. Such a failure to request a hearing will result in a default judgment being entered upholding the notice of
violation and assessing accrued fees, penalties and costs.
C. Procedures At Code Enforcement Hearings:
1. Informal In Nature: Code enforcement hearings are intended to be informal in nature. The formal Utah Rules of Evidence and Discovery do not
apply; however, an informal exchange of relevant documents and other evidence may be required at the discretion of the Hearing Officer.

the hearing, notice of the attorney's name, address, and telephone number must be given to the City's Code Enforcement Program Office at least

continued at the City's request, and any costs of the continuance will be assessed to the responsible person.
9. Fee Refund If Violation Dismissed: If the Hearing Officer dismisses the notice of violation entirely, the hearing fee shall be refunded to the
responsible person who paid it.

judgment.
C. Service Of Default Judgment: A copy of a signed default judgment shall be served on all applicable responsible persons promptly following signing by
the Hearing Officer.

Officer shall cause a Code enforcement hearing to be scheduled and noticed according to the requirements of this article.

E. Cancellation Of Recorded Notice Or Order: If a notice of compliance is issued, the enforcement official may record the notice with the County

Code violations are necessary within one year of the date of any default judgment or Code enforcement order, the enforcement official may assess
treble costs against the responsible person(s) for the subsequent abatement(s).

this article through procedures set forth herein or through a court of competent jurisdiction.

prior to a requested Code enforcement hearing under the notice of violation, the hearing on the merits of the notice of violation can be consolidated
with any requested hearing under this subsection to challenge a cost or abatement action. (Ord. 2018-03, 3-27-2018)

in a reasonable manner to abate any Code violation as specified in a Code enforcement order.

responsible person(s).

any provision of this Code may be enforced by injunction issued in the District Court upon suit brought by the City. (Ord. 2018-03, 3-27-2018)

inspecting and re-inspecting properties throughout the City in an effort to ensure compliance with this Code.
2. The City further finds that the assessment of costs in addition to penalty assessments is an appropriate method to recover expenses incurred for
actual costs of abating violations, performing re-inspections, retaining attorneys, preparing for and conducting hearings, title searches, and any
additional costs incurred by the City for each individual case. The assessment and collection of costs shall not preclude the imposition of any
administrative or judicial civil penalties.

due will result in no hearing being scheduled.

Code. The procedures established in this article shall be used to complement existing administrative or judicial remedies that may be pursued to
address violations of this Code.
F. Procedures For Tax Liens Without A Judgment:
1. The City Manager or his or her designee is authorized to record with the County Treasurer a Code enforcement tax lien against real property for the
accrued fees, penalties and costs incurred during a City performed abatement.
2. The failure of any person with a legal or financial interest in the property to actually receive the notice of Code enforcement tax lien shall not affect
the validity of the lien or any proceedings taken to collect the outstanding penalties, costs and fees associated with an abatement.
G. Cancellation Of Code Enforcement Tax Lien: Once payment in full is received for the outstanding penalties and assessed costs, or the amount is
deemed satisfied pursuant to a subsequent administrative or judicial order, the City shall either record a notice of satisfaction against the same
property, or provide the property owner with the notice of satisfaction to be recorded. The notice of satisfaction shall include the same information as
provided for in the original Code enforcement tax lien. Such notice of satisfaction shall cancel the Code enforcement tax lien.
H. Procedures For Tax Liens With A Judgment: Once a civil judgment has been obtained from the appropriate court approving fees, penalties and costs
against the responsible person(s), the City may record that judgment as a Code enforcement tax lien against any real property owned by the
responsible person(s).

use of all appropriate legal means, including, but not limited to, garnishment of wages and accounts and foreclosure on real and personal property.

1. Generally: This subsection provides guidance on purchasing from government, including when agreements must be executed in compliance with the
interlocal cooperation act.
2. Solicitation Requirements When Contracting With Government: Whenever the city agrees to make purchases together with another governmental
entity, and the agreement is entered in compliance with the solicitation procedures of that other entity, the city shall be deemed to have complied with
city solicitation requirements.
3. Interlocal Cooperation Act: Certain agreements must be executed in compliance with the interlocal cooperation act, Utah code title 11, chapter 13. In
addition to that act, agreements shall comply with the following:
a. When Compliance Required: Contracts for the following must comply with the interlocal cooperation act:
(1) Joint Action: The city must comply when it agrees to exercise powers jointly with another governmental agency to undertake a joint or
cooperative action. Such an action may require the creation of a separate legal entity, such as a partnership or association.
(2) Government Function: The city must comply when it agrees with a governmental entity to perform any governmental service, activity or
undertaking that the city or the other entity is otherwise authorized by law to perform. Governmental services, activities or undertakings include
the following: flood control, storm drainage, government administration, planning and zoning, buildings and grounds, education, healthcare,
parks and recreation, police and fire protection, prosecution of violations of state criminal statutes, defense of individuals prosecuted for
violations of state criminal statutes, transportation, streets and roads, utilities, culinary water, sewage disposal, social services, solid waste
disposal, economic development or new venture investment fund, and library. See Utah Code Annotated section 11-13-212, or its successor.

See Utah Code Annotated section 11-13-213, or its successor.
4. Compliance: To comply with the interlocal cooperation act an agreement must be approved by a resolution of the city council.
5. Compliance Not Required: The following are some types of agreements with government that are not subject to the interlocal cooperation act. This
list is provided for convenience only and is not comprehensive.
a. Purchases: Contracts solely to acquire supplies from another governmental agency, or solely to acquire services if they are not governmental
services, activities or undertakings as described in subsection E3a(2) of this section.
b. Copurchases: Contracts where the city joins as a group with other governmental agencies to purchase supplies, or services that are not
governmental services, activities or undertakings as described in subsection E3a(2) of this section, where the agreement relates to acquisitions
and not to the formation of a cooperative purchasing unit.
c. Sales: Contracts solely to sell supplies owned by the city to another governmental agency.
d. Leases: Contracts solely to lease city property to another governmental agency, where the city's only role is that of a typical lessor.
F. Sole Source Procurement:
1. Definitions: Without limitation, sole source procurement may arise when:
a. The city needs a supply or service of a unique or specialized nature, and only one known supplier is reasonably available to meet the need.
b. Specific parts, accessories, equipment, materials, services, proprietary items or other items are necessary to meet the city's needs, and there are
no comparable items reasonably available.
c. Items are procured for resale.
2. Process: To use sole source procurement, the purchasing agent, or designee, shall place a written determination in the procurement file, after
conducting a good faith review of available sources, stating why no other sources are reasonably available, or why competition would not be likely to
produce other acceptable offers. Sole source procurement shall not be used only to accommodate a desire for a particular proprietary item unless
the city has a need for such item, which can be justified in writing pursuant to the provisions of subsection F1 of this section. The purchasing agent,
or designee, shall negotiate and use appropriate means to obtain the best price available for the item being procured.
3. Records: A record of sole source procurement shall be maintained as a public record and shall list each contractor's name, the amount and type of
each procurement agreement, a listing of the item(s) procured under each procurement, and the identification number of each procurement file.
G. Procurement To Meet Existing Needs:
1. Definition: Procurement to meet existing needs may arise when there is a need to procure matching or compatible supplies and services when other
similar supplies and services would not be reasonably beneficial to meet the city's needs in connection with existing equipment or facilities.
2. Process: To use existing needs procurement, the purchasing agent, or designee, shall place a written determination in the procurement file
specifying the existing items, and explaining the need to match or service them. The purchasing agent, or designee, department head, or designee,
employee designated by department head, shall negotiate and use appropriate means to obtain the best price available for the item being procured.
H. Very Specialized Or Confidential Services:
1. Definition: Without limitation, the need to procure very specialized services, or services as a part of confidential matters, may arise when:
a. The city's needs are of a specific and highly specialized nature, and a general solicitation would not be beneficial to produce a person who can
meet those needs because of the scarcity of service providers, nature of the expertise needed, conflicts of interest, or other reason.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 75/359
b. The services relate to confidential matters, and a solicitation process might disclose or result in adverse consequences with respect to information
that is private or confidential. These matters can arise in connection with legal issues, security issues, undercover police activities, and similar
matters.
2. Process: Except as otherwise provided by the city manager, to procure on this basis, the purchasing agent, or designee, shall place a written
determination in the procurement file stating the required service, and explaining why a solicitation process would not be beneficial or would damage
confidential interests. The purchasing agent, or designee, department head, or designee, employee designated by department head, shall negotiate
and use all appropriate means to obtain the best price available.
I. Emergencies And Public Threats:
1. Generally: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the purchasing agent, or designee, may make, or authorize others to make,
emergency procurement of supplies, services, or construction items when there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or safety; provided that such
emergencies and public threats shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. Procurement made on this basis
shall be issued as set forth in this section.
2. Definitions: The conditions specified in this section are defined as follows:
EMERGENCY CONDITIONS: An "emergency condition" creates an immediate and serious need for supplies or services that cannot adequately be
addressed using normal procurement methods. Such a need may arise by reason of a natural disaster, epidemic, riot, equipment failure or other
reason.
PUBLIC THREATS: Circumstances that appear likely to adversely impact the public's health, welfare, convenience or safety. They may arise when
circumstances appear to create a risk of environmental contamination, traffic congestion or hazards, disruption of utility or other public services
provided by the city, or other matters.
3. Process: The purchasing agent, or designee, shall examine the circumstances and determine whether they constitute a condition set forth above. If
so, the purchasing agent, or designee, may take any action required by such condition. The purchasing agent, or designee, shall place in the
procurement file a written determination and explanation of the condition. Procurement should be as competitive as possible under the
circumstances, but priority shall be given to meeting the needs of the emergency or public threat. Only those supplies and services impacted by the
condition in question may be acquired under this subsection.
J. Unforeseen Conditions:
1. Definition: An "unforeseen condition" creates a need to procure supplies or services within time frames that could not reasonably be anticipated or
accommodated under normal procurement methods. For example, such a need may arise when the city must implement a change that is beneficial
to the city in a time frame that will not allow normal procurement methods, and the benefit of proceeding outweighs the benefit of using processes
under this chapter.
2. Process: The purchasing agent, or designee, shall require the employee making such a request to justify in writing why the condition was
unforeseen, and shall make a decision based upon the written justification as to whether the condition was unforeseen. After determining that such a
condition exists, the purchasing agent, or designee, may take any action required by such condition, and shall place in the procurement file a written
determination and explanation of the waiver. If the purchasing agent, or designee, determines that the condition was foreseen, or reasonably could
have been foreseen, the procurement shall proceed under the normal provisions of this chapter.
K. Market Commodities: The purchasing agent, or designee, may exempt commodity purchases from the requirements of this chapter when the city's
internal, written market analysis, a copy of which shall be maintained in the procurement file, indicates that such procurements are in the best interests
of the city. The purchasing agent, or designee, shall take into account opportunities to take advantage of seasonal and supply/demand influences when
determining whether to exempt commodity purchases.
L. Cancellation Of Invitations For Bids Or Requests For Proposals: An invitation for bids, an RFP, an RFQ or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or
all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is for good cause and in the best interests of the
city. The reasons therefor shall be made part of the agreement file. Each solicitation issued by the city shall state that the solicitation may be canceled
and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in whole or in part for good cause when in the best interests of the city. Notice of cancellation shall be
sent to all businesses solicited. The notice shall identify the solicitation, explain the reason for cancellation and, where appropriate, explain that an
opportunity will be given to compete on any resolicitation or any future procurement of similar items. Reasons for rejection shall be provided upon
request by unsuccessful bidders or offerors.
M. Evaluation:
1. Generally: Bids, proposals, agreements and related matters shall be evaluated using the criteria in this chapter.
2. City's Evaluation Process: When evaluating matters, the city shall consider the following:
a. Solicitation Criteria: The city shall consider the evaluation criteria stated in a bid or proposal package or other solicitation document.
b. Chapter Criteria: As further described in this chapter, the city shall consider whether a bid, proposal or other offer or submission is responsive to
the city's request, whether the bidder or offeror is the lowest responsive responsible bidder, responsible, and whether any element conflicts with
the other criteria of this chapter.
c. Due Diligence: The city may take steps as it deems appropriate to verify and determine any matter. The city shall determine in its sole discretion
what steps may be appropriate in light of the matters being considered and the resources of the city. The failure to discover any matter shall not
preclude any subsequent evaluation or action.
d. Records: In the manner it shall determine, the purchasing agent, or designee, shall retain in a procurement file records relevant to a solicitation or
award.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 76/359
e. Agreement Management: The city may reevaluate any matter arising under an agreement which is in conflict with its procurement, or with this
chapter or city procurement rules. Any previous determination made by the city shall be subject to change by subsequently discovered matters.
3. Evaluating Responsiveness: To be responsive, a bid, proposal or other offer or submission must conform in all material respects to the terms of the
city's solicitation documents. Such terms may include, but are not limited to, using bid forms, mandatory submittals, required securities, and
appropriate substantive responses. Ministerial errors and other matters in a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will not necessarily render it
nonresponsive, and the purchasing agent or designee shall review such matters and determine whether the submission is responsive.
4. Evaluating Responsibility: To be responsible, a bidder or offeror must have the capability in all respects to fully perform the agreement requirements,
and have the integrity, capacity and reliability which will assure good faith performance.
5. Determining The Lowest Responsive Responsible Bidder: The city shall consider the following factors to determine the lowest responsive
responsible bidder:
a. To be responsive, a bid, proposal, or other offer or submission must conform in all material respects to the terms of the city's solicitation
documents. Such terms may include, but are not limited to, using bid forms, mandatory submittals, required securities, and appropriate substantive
responses. Ministerial errors and other matters in a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will not necessarily render it nonresponsive, and the
purchase agent, or designee, shall review such matters in determining whether the submission is responsive.
b. To be responsible, a bidder or offeror must have the capability in all respects to fully perform the agreement requirements, and have the integrity,
capacity and reliability which will assure good faith performance. The city may consider any relevant factors when evaluating responsibility,
including the following:
(1) The bidder's or offeror's capacity to perform the contractual requirements, including whether the bidder or offeror has available appropriate
financial, material, equipment, facility and personnel resources and expertise, or the ability to obtain them. Without limitation, capacity may also
include legal capacity to enter agreements, the ability to perform within required times, or the ability to perform any necessary future service and
maintenance.
(2) The bidder's or offeror's ability, skill and quality of performance.
(3) The bidder's or offeror's character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency.
(4) The bidder's or offeror's ability to work cooperatively with the city, including, without limitation, whether the bidder or offeror has previously failed
to comply with city agreements or other requirements, nonpayment of sums due to the city, poor working relationships with or adversarial actions
against the city, suspension, debarment or other proceedings by the city against the bidder or offeror, or failure to assist the city in determining
responsibility.
6. Making A Determination: The submission of any bid, proposal or other offer or submission constitutes an agreement by the bidder or offeror to
reasonably assist the city with its determination of responsibility.
7. Effect Of Determination: The city's determination of responsibility relates solely to a bidder's overall ability to perform for a specific procurement, and
is not a general assessment of a bidder's capabilities.
8. Evaluating Specific Matters: For any bid, proposal, other offer or submission:
a. Joint Ventures: A joint venture may submit a bid, proposal or other offer or submission if the circumstances of the joint venture are acceptable to
the purchasing agent, or designee. The joint venture must obtain this determination before an agreement may be signed.
b. Consultants: Persons who have provided services to the city in connection with a bid, proposal or other offer or submission, such as by preparing
specifications or designs, performing surveying or testing, or any other function, may participate in a subsequent solicitation and award except
when a purchasing agent, or designee, determines it would not be in the city's interest. Where possible, such determinations should be made prior
to engaging the consultant. Such determinations and the written basis for decisions will be placed in the procurement files.
c. Multiple Or Alternate Bids, Proposals Or Other Submissions: Multiple or alternate bids, proposals or other offers or submissions will not be
considered or accepted unless they have been solicited. A base bid or proposal, when clearly indicated, shall be considered as though it was the
only bid or proposal. Multiple or alternate bids may be solicited as prescribed by the purchasing agent or designee.
d. No Dependent Bids: Bid, proposal and other offer or submission materials and prices must stand alone and not be dependent on the submission
of another person.
e. Tie Bids: Tie bids occur when identical prices are submitted from responsive and responsible bidders and that price is the low bid. The purchasing
agent, or designee, shall make an award in a manner that is beneficial to the city, and may make an award in a manner that will discourage tie
bids. Such manners may include:
(1) Award to the person who previously held the agreement.
(2) Award to the person with the earliest delivery date.
f. Only One Received: If the city receives only one responsive bid, proposal or other offer or submission, the city may make an award to that bidder
or offeror if the purchasing agent, or designee, determines the bid, proposal or other offer or submission is fair and reasonable and conforms to all
applicable requirements, and that other prospective bidders or offerors had reasonable opportunity to respond or that there is not adequate time
for a resolicitation. The written determination and basis for decision shall be placed in the procurement file. The city may also reject the sole bid,
proposal or other offer or submission.
9. Inspections And Tests: The city may perform inspections, tests and other evaluations in any manner conducive to the city's interest, including,
without limitation, the use of third parties. All prospective and actual recipients of a city agreement shall provide all reasonable assistance and
information required by the city to perform an inspection, test or other evaluation.
10. Modifying Submissions: After the time for submission, a bid, proposal or other offer or submission may be modified as follows:
a. Confirmation Of Bid, Proposal Or Other Matter: When it appears a mistake has been made, or when the city desires an assurance of any matter,
the city may request a bidder or offeror to confirm the bid, proposal or other offer or submission in writing.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 77/359
b. Notification Of Error: A bidder or offeror shall notify the purchasing agent, or designee, of any error contained in a bid, proposal or other offer or
submission within twenty four (24) hours after bid opening or the time for submitting proposals unless the purchasing agent, or designee, waives
this requirement. The purchasing agent, or designee, shall have sole discretion to determine whether to permit any modification or withdrawal.
c. Modifications By Agreement: The purchasing agent, or designee, may agree with a bidder or offeror to any modifications so long as they do not
prejudice fair competition or the city's interests. Modifications may include such matters as:
(1) Time For Accepting: The purchasing agent, or designee, and bidder or offeror may agree that a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will
remain effective for a longer period of time than that stated in the bid, proposal or other offer or submission.
(2) Subcontractor Or Supplier Changes: Any proposed change in subcontractors or suppliers must be submitted to the purchasing agent, or
designee, and the purchasing agent, or designee, may reject any such proposed change. The bidder or offeror will receive no additional
compensation as a result of a change to any subcontractors or suppliers, and must continue to meet the requirements of any federally mandated
program and other contractual and legal requirements.
(3) Change In Specifications: The purchasing agent, or designee, and bidder or offeror may agree to a change in specifications when such change
is in the city's interest, is reasonably related to the work originally solicited, and would not be prejudicial to fair competition.
(4) Withdrawal Of Bid: If a withdrawal of a bid or offer is permitted, the city shall not be precluded from initiating a claim against the bidder or
offeror's bid security.
d. City's Correction Of Ministerial Mistakes: The purchasing agent, or designee, may at any time correct mistakes in a bid or proposal that are of a
ministerial or minor nature as follows:
(1) Ministerial Mistakes: Ministerial or minor informalities are clerical errors and matters of form rather than substance that are evident from the
document, or insignificant mistakes or informalities that can be waived or corrected without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. They generally
do not have a substantial effect on price. Examples include a failure to:
(A) Sign the bid, proposal, or other submissions requiring signature, but only where they are accompanied by other materials indicating an intent
to be bound.
(B) Acknowledge receipt of an addendum, but only if the materials demonstrate the bidder or offeror received the addendum and intended to be
bound by it, or the addendum has a negligible effect on the bid, proposal or other offer or submission.
(2) Mistakes Where Intent Is Evident: If the intent of the bid, proposal or other offer or submission is clearly evident on the face of the document,
the purchasing agent, or designee, may correct it as intended and it may not be withdrawn. Examples include:
(A) Typographical errors.
(B) Errors in extending unit prices.
(C) Transposition errors.
(D) Mathematical errors.
(E) Differences in written and numerical prices (written shall control).
(3) Mistakes Where Intent Not Evident: If the bidder or offeror's intent is not clearly evident on the face of the document, the bid, proposal or other
offer or submission may not be withdrawn except as agreed by the purchasing agent, or designee. If a withdrawal of a bid or offer is permitted,
the city shall not be precluded from initiating a claim against the bidder or offeror's bid security.
e. Correcting Errors In Judgment: Errors in judgment may not be corrected, and the bid, proposal or other offer or submission may not be withdrawn,
except as agreed by the purchasing agent, or designee. The purchasing agent, or designee, may allow correction of an error in judgment if it can
be done without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. The purchasing agent, or designee, may allow withdrawal if it is in the city's interest.
11. Evaluating Cost Or Price: The city may require the submission of any cost, price or value data, and may evaluate such data in any manner
determined by a purchasing agent, or designee. Such evaluation may include an analysis of life cycle costs, maintenance costs, market pricing,
rebates or discounts, direct costs, indirect cost allocations, profit, billing and accounting techniques, price balance among bid or proposal items, or
any other matters relating to cost, price or value. The city may take any of the following actions in connection therewith:
a. Reject Bid Or Proposal: The city may reject any unbalanced bid, proposal or offer. The city may also reject any bid, proposal or offer where cost,
price or value data is not provided as reasonably requested, or where such data indicates conditions that are not in the city's interest.
b. Audit: At reasonable times and places, the city may audit or cause to be audited the books and records of any person submitting cost or price data
to determine whether they are reasonable and accurate, and in compliance with any other requirements.
N. Responsibility Of Bidders And Offerors:
1. Determination Of Nonresponsibility: If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded an agreement is found nonresponsible, a written
determination of nonresponsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the purchasing agent, or designee. The unreasonable
failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a
determination of nonresponsibility with respect to such bidder or offeror. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the nonresponsible
bidder or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the agreement file and be made public record.
2. Right Of Nondisclosure: Prior to award of the bid, information furnished by a bidder or offeror pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed by the
city outside of the office of the purchasing agent, or designee, or using agency, without prior written consent by the bidder or offeror, unless otherwise
required by law.
O. Cost Or Pricing Data:
1. Required Submissions Relating To The Award Of Contracts: A prospective contractor shall submit cost or pricing data when the agreement is
expected to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) and is to be awarded by competitive sealed proposals (subsection B, "Competitive Sealed
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 78/359
Proposals", of this section), or by sole source procurement authority (subsection F, "Sole Source Procurement", of this section).
2. Exceptions: The submission of cost or pricing data relating to the award of an agreement is not required when:
a. The agreement price is based on adequate price competition;
b. The agreement price is based on established catalog prices or market prices;
c. The agreement price is set by law or regulation; or
d. It is determined in writing by the purchasing agent, or designee, that the requirements of subsection O1, "Required Submissions Relating To The
Award Of Contracts", of this section, may be waived, and the determination states the reasons for such waiver.
3. Required Submissions Relating To Change Orders Or Agreement Modifications: A contractor shall submit cost or pricing data prior to the pricing of
any change order or agreement modification, including adjustments to agreements awarded by competitive sealed bidding, whether or not cost or
pricing data was required in connection with the initial pricing of the agreement, when the change or modification involves aggregate increases or
aggregate decreases in costs plus applicable profits that are expected to exceed twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).
4. Exceptions: The submission of cost or pricing data relating to the pricing of a change order or agreement modification is not required when:
a. Unrelated and separately priced adjustments for which cost or pricing data would not be required are consolidated for administrative convenience;
or
b. It is determined in writing by the purchasing agent, or designee, that the requirements of subsection O3, "Required Submissions Relating To
Change Orders Or Agreement Modifications", of this section, may be waived, and the determination states the reasons for such waiver.
P. Bid, Payment And Performance Bonds On Supply Or Service Contracts: Bid, payment and performance bonds or other security may be requested for
supply agreements or service agreements as the purchasing agent, or designee, deems advisable to protect the city's interests. Any such bonding or
other security requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a
bidder or offeror's responsibility. (Ord. 2009-51, 12-8-2009)
2-3-3: TYPES OF CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENT ADMINISTRATION:
A. Types Of Contracts:
1. General Authority: Subject to the limitations of this chapter, any type of agreement which is appropriate to the procurement and which will promote
the best interest of the city may be used, provided that the use of a cost plus a percentage of cost agreement is prohibited. A cost reimbursement
agreement may be used only when a determination is made in writing that such agreement is likely to be less costly to the city than any other type or
that it is impracticable to obtain the supply, service, or construction item required except under such an agreement.
2. Multiterm Contracts:
a. Specified Period: Unless otherwise provided by law, an agreement for supplies or services may be entered into for any period of time deemed to
be in the best interests of the city, provided the terms of the agreement and conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in the
solicitation and funds are available for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting. Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal
periods shall be subject to the availability and appropriation of funds therefor.
b. Determination Prior To Use: Prior to the utilization of a multiterm agreement, it shall be determined in writing:
(1) That estimated requirements cover the period of the agreement and are reasonably firm and continuing; and
(2) That such an agreement will serve the best interests of the city by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economies in city
procurement.
c. Cancellation Due To Unavailability Of Funds In Succeeding Fiscal Periods: When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to
support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the agreement may be canceled.
3. Multiple Source Contracting:
a. General: A multiple source award is an award of an indefinite quantity agreement for one or more similar supplies or services to more than one
bidder or offeror. The obligation to order the city's actual requirements is limited by the provision of uniform commercial code section 2-306(1).
b. Limitations On Use: A multiple source award may be made when award to two (2) or more bidders or offerors for similar products is necessary for
adequate delivery, service, or product compatibility. Any multiple source award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subsections 2-3-
2A, "Competitive Sealed Bidding"; B, "Competitive Sealed Proposals"; D, "General Procurement"; and I, "Emergencies And Public Threats", of this
chapter, as applicable. Multiple source awards shall not be made when a single award will meet the city's needs without sacrifice of economy or
service. Awards shall not be made for the purpose of dividing the business, making available product or supplier selection to allow for user
preference unrelated to utility or economy, or avoiding the resolution of tie bids. Any such awards shall be limited to the least number of suppliers
necessary to meet the valid requirements.
c. Agreement And Solicitation Provisions: All eligible users of the agreement, provided that:
(1) The city shall reserve the right to take bids separately if a particular quantity requirement arises which exceeds its normal requirement or an
amount specified in the agreement; and
(2) The city shall reserve the right to take bids separately if the purchasing agent, or designee, approves a finding that the supply or service
available under the agreement will not meet a nonrecurring special need of the city.
d. Intent To Use: If a multiple source award is anticipated prior to issuing a solicitation, the city shall reserve the right to make such an award and the
criteria for award shall be stated in the solicitation.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 79/359
e. Determination Required: The purchasing agent, or designee, shall make a written determination setting forth the reasons for a multiple source
award, which shall be made a part of the procurement file.
B. Agreement Clauses And Their Administration:
1. Agreement Clauses: All city agreements for supplies, services, and construction shall include provisions necessary to define the responsibilities and
rights of the parties to the agreement. The purchasing agent, or designee, after consultation with the city attorney, may issue clauses appropriate for
supply, service, or construction agreements, addressing among others the following subjects:
a. The unilateral right of the city to order in writing changes in the work within the scope of the agreement;
b. The unilateral right of the city to order in writing temporary stopping of the work or delaying performance that does not alter the scope of the
agreement;
c. Variations occurring between estimated quantities of work in agreement and actual quantities;
d. Defective pricing;
e. Liquidated damages;
f. Specified excuses for delay or nonperformance;
g. Termination of the agreement for default;
h. Termination of the agreement in whole or in part for the convenience of the city;
i. Suspension of work on a construction project ordered by the city; and
j. Site conditions differing from those indicated in the agreement, or ordinarily encountered, except that a differing site conditions clause need not be
included in an agreement:
(1) When the agreement is negotiated;
(2) When the contractor provides the site or design; or
(3) When the parties have otherwise agreed with respect to the risk of differing site conditions.
2. Price Adjustments:
a. Adjustments in price resulting from the use of agreement clauses required by subsection B1 of this section shall be computed in one or more of
the following ways:
(1) By written agreement on a fixed price adjustment before commencement of the pertinent performance or as soon thereafter as practicable;
(2) By unit prices specified in the agreement or subsequently agreed upon in writing;
(3) By the costs attributable to the events or situations under such clauses with adjustment of profit or fee, all as specified in the agreement or
subsequently agreed upon in writing;
(4) In such other manner as the contracting parties may mutually agree in writing; or
(5) In the absence of an agreement by the parties, by a unilateral determination by the city of the costs attributable to the events or situations
under such clauses with adjustment of profit or fee as computed by the city, as accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and subject to the provisions of section 2-3-7, "Appeals And Remedies", of this chapter.
3. Contractor's Submissions: A contractor shall be required to submit cost or pricing data if any adjustment in agreement price is subject to the
provisions of subsection 2-3-2O, "Cost Or Pricing Data", of this chapter.
4. Standard Clauses And Their Modification: The purchasing agent, or designee, after consultation with the city attorney, may establish standard
agreement clauses for use in city agreements. If the purchasing agent, or designee, establishes any standard clauses addressing the subjects set
forth in subsection B1 of this section, such clauses may be varied provided that any variations are supported by a written determination that states
the circumstances justifying such variations, and provided that notice of any such material variation is stated in the invitation for bids or RFP.
C. Agreement Administration: An agreement administration system designed to ensure that a contractor is performing in accordance with the solicitation
under which the agreement was awarded, and the terms and conditions of the agreement, shall be maintained.

Requests that include the inspection of a voluminous scope of records and/or have not identified any particular record(s) with any degree of
specificity, will need to adhere to the following procedures and guidelines in order for the City to reasonably facilitate the request:
A.
Written notice must be provided to the Office of the City Recorder at least 10 business days in advance of the date and times desired to inspect
the City's public records. Said notice must include a particular category of records to examine on each date so that those records may be
pulled, placed in a central location, and then reviewed for any private, controlled, or protected documents in advance of the inspection.
B.
Appointments to inspect the City's public records will be made in 4 hour time blocks, either from the hours of 8:30 A.M. until 12:30 P.M. or from
1:00 P.M. until 5:00 P.M. Requesters may utilize only one 4-hour time block for inspecting records per day and must not request more than 2
such appointments per week.
C.
The City shall charge a reasonable fee to cover its actual costs for accommodating the records request. Pursuant to this fee schedule, the
requester will be charged a minimum of $14.00 per hour to cover the necessary staff time to facilitate complying with the request. The
requester must pay $56.00 (4 hours x $14.00/hour) in advance for each 4 hour block of inspection time scheduled. However, that amount is
only designed to offset the City's labor costs to have an employee sit with the requester while any public records are inspected in order to
maintain the integrity of said records. Any additional costs for searching, retrieval, compiling, formatting, manipulating, packaging,
summarizing, tailoring, copying, etc., will be charged in addition to the $56.00 per 4 hour inspection block that will have already been paid in
advance.

A. Residents of the city have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or
receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The city has a
substantial interest in protecting the well being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from
unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The city also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer
sales practices as well as criminal activity.
B. There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the city and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the rights of
those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property
from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door to door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and
those affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded
and denied persons seeking to engage in door to door solicitation, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city's substantial interests in:
1. Respecting citizen's decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
2. Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
3. Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
4. Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door to door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
C. The city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city interests referred
to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated. (Ord. 2009-15, 11-24-2009)

TELECOMMUNICATIONS USE OF RIGHTS OF WAY
8-6-1: FINDINGS AND INTENT; AUTHORITY:
A. Rights Of Way: The City finds that the rights of way within the City:
1. Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the City;
2. Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;
3. Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the
enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well-being of the City and its citizens; and
4. Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of
the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement, relocation
and maintenance in the rights of way.
B. Compensation: The City finds that the City should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
C. Local Concern: The City finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve
rights of way, municipal franchising and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
D. Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The City finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development
of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for City,
educational and community services.
E. Franchise Standards: The City finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner
that:
1. Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
2. Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
3. Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
4. Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of the City, in a manner consistent with Federal and State law;
5. Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the City infrastructure;
6. Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of way; and
7. Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
F. Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The City adopts this telecommunications Chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights of way, pursuant to
common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights of way by providers as
expressly set forth by section 253 of the Act. (Ord. 98-12, 12-8-1998)

8-6-4: APPLICABILITY; EXCEPTIONS:
A. Providers: This Chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of the rights

telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise. (Ord. 98-12, 12-8-1998)

consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.

approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
G. Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise shall

franchise term proposed by the provider.
3. Provider's agreement to comply with the requirements of this chapter.

8-6-7: COMPENSATION, FEES AND PAYMENTS:
A. Compensation; Provider Obligations: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the
following obligations: (Ord. 98-12, 12-8-1998)

provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, a nonrefundable application fee in the amount required by the city's fee schedule. (Ord. 2008-
15, 12-9-2008)

E. Taxes, Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city property as a
result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable
annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter.
F. Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise,
interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
G. Acceptance Of Fee; Not Construed Satisfaction: No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums
payable.
H. Additional Taxes Or Fees Still Applicable: The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided
in this Chapter or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the Cityowned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
I. Operation After Term; Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the
franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this Chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all
compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall in no
way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
J. Publication Costs: A provider shall assume any publication costs associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 98-12, 12-8-1998)

as required by the terms of the franchise, and shall obtain and provide proof of the insurance coverage required by the franchise. A provider shall also
indemnify the City as set forth in the franchise.
B. Inspection By City; Management: The City shall have the right to oversee, regulate and inspect periodically the construction, maintenance and upgrade
of the system, and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain
managerial and operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the
City at all times throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A provider shall retain such records for not less than the
applicable statute of limitations.

books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance with this Section. All financial books and records which are
maintained in accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that regulates utilities in the State and generally accepted
accounting principles shall be deemed to be acceptable under this Section.

proper request by a provider, such information shall be classified as a protected record within the meaning of the Utah Government Records Access
and Management Act (GRAMA), making it available only to those who must have access to perform their duties on behalf of the City; provided, that a
provider notifies the City of, and clearly labels the information which a provider deems to be confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and
labeling shall be the sole responsibility of the provider.
E. Provider's Expense: All reports and records required under this Chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise
provided in this Chapter or a franchise.
F. Right Of Inspection: For the purpose of verifying the correct amount of the franchise fee, the books and records of the provider pertaining thereto shall
be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the City at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records. The provider agrees to reimburse the City the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit discloses that the
provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the compensation due the City for the period of such audit. In the event the accounting rendered
to the City by the provider herein is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty (30) calendar days of
written notice, it being agreed that the City may accept any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the City shall not be deemed
a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or is later found to be incorrect. (Ord. 98-12, 12-8-1998)

to move or remove its system from the rights of way, without cost to the City, to the extent provided in Chapter 2 of this Title. This obligation does not
apply to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights of way, if
that private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
E. Protection Of Structures, Landmarks: In connection with the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its

7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 196/359
A. Imposed: Each parcel of real property in the city which uses the city's stormwater system to dispose of irrigation or storm water shall be charged a
stormwater utility fee.
B. ESU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service units (ESUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ESU is the most
accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the stormwater utility. The city
council finds and establishes that one ESU equals two thousand seven hundred (2,700) square feet of impervious surface area.
C. Calculation: The city council finds that each single-family residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater runoff; therefore,
each developed single-family residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one ESU. All nonsingle-family residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this
base rate, expressed in ESUs according to the measured impervious area on the parcel.
D. Charge Per ESU: The amount charged for each ESU shall be in accordance with the city's consolidated fee schedule and may be amended by
ordinance of the city council. Commercial and industrial parcels may receive a reduction for having on site mitigation.
E. Credit For On Site Mitigation: Nonresidential parcels with on site stormwater detention, retention or mitigation management facilities will be eligible for a
service charge credit as follows:
1. Fifty percent (50%) reduction for a parcel that has an on site detention basin constructed to city standards with a maximum release from the basin of
0.20 cfs/ac within a landscaped area on site and having installed an approved sand and oil interceptor system before discharging into the city's storm
drain system.
2. Thirty percent (30%) reduction for a parcel that has an on site detention basin constructed to city standards with a maximum release from the basin
of 0.20 cfs/ac within a landscaped area or a retention basin within a landscaped area on site.
3. Twenty percent (20%) reduction for a parcel that has an on site detention basin constructed to city standards of a maximum release of 0.20 cfs/ac
within an impervious surface area on the site or within a piping system designed for detention on site.
F. Exemptions And Credits: The city council may establish exemptions and credits to the stormwater utility fee by resolution.
G. Policies: The public works department may adopt policies, consistent with this chapter and any resolutions passed by the city council, to assist in the
application, administration and interpretation of this chapter and any resolutions related to the stormwater utility.
H. Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this chapter, or any stormwater utility rate ordinance, was interpreted or applied erroneously may appeal
to the city council at a regularly scheduled council meeting. The appeal shall be in writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and shall be

9-3-6: BILLING:
The city council finds that the city's stormwater system, sanitary sewer system, culinary water system, and solid waste collection system are interrelated
services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally responsible
manner. Therefore, the stormwater utility fee shall be included on the city's regular monthly utility bill for any given property. If there is no regular utility bill
for the property, the stormwater utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the city by the person
or entity paying for the city utility services provided to the property. All properties shall be charged the fee, regardless of whether or not the owner or
occupant of the property requests the stormwater utility service. Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of water service. (Ord.

STORMWATER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY PERMITS
9-4-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. The purpose of this chapter is to prevent the discharge of sediment and other construction related pollutants from construction sites into the city's
waterways and water systems and surrounding areas. Each year stormwater runoff carries tons of sediment from construction sites into local drainage
systems, irrigation systems, canals, rivers, and lakes. Sediment from stormwater runoff also clogs and obstructs storm drains, culverts, and canals and
causes damage to private property, wildlife habitat and water quality.
B. The city engineer shall design and the public works director shall approve construction specifications and standards for the city's storm drain system. All
construction and development activity on the city's storm drain system shall comply with the construction specifications and standards, copies of which
shall be available in the offices of the city recorder and public works department. (Ord. 2008-16, 12-9-2008)
9-4-2: WHEN REQUIRED:
Subject to the exemptions listed in section 9-4-9 of this chapter, a Clearfield City stormwater construction activity permit is required before any person or
entity may excavate, grub and clear, grade, or perform any type of construction activity that will disrupt or cause a change in the natural landscape upon
any of the following types of property located within the city:
A. One Acre Or More: Any parcel, lot or land development which is equal to or greater than one acre (43,560 square feet) in size. A subdivision
development greater than or equal to one acre in size qualifies under this subsection even if each of the individual lots in the subdivision is smaller than
one acre.
B. Special Concern Areas: Any parcel, lot or land development for which the city determines that because of the nature or type of the parcel, lot or
development, disturbance of the land is likely to result in erosion or the transport of sediment off of the site by stormwater to a degree substantially
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 200/359
greater than that which would occur under natural landscape conditions. (Ord. 2008-16, 12-9-2008)
9-4-3: APPLICATION:
Any person or entity desiring a stormwater construction activity permit must first file an application with the planning and zoning secretary. The application
shall be submitted with, or as part of, an application for a site plan or subdivision approval or building permit.
A. Content: The application shall include a stormwater pollution plan which meets the criteria set forth in section 9-4-4 of this chapter.
B. Timing: The applicant shall file the application on or before the following dates:
1. Subdivision: The date that the applicant submits the subdivision preliminary plat application if the applicant proposes to develop a subdivision.
2. Site Plan: The date that the applicant submits a site plan application if the applicant proposes to develop a site plan or amended site plan.
3. Building Permit: The date that the applicant submits a building permit application if the applicant proposes to construct a building on an existing lot or
parcel.
4. Other: At least two (2) weeks before the developer intends to perform any type of work not listed above that would require a stormwater construction
activity permit pursuant to this chapter.
C. Compliance: If an applicant's development comes under more than one of the categories listed above, then the applicant shall submit the stormwater
construction activity permit application on the earliest of the dates. Failure to comply with the application dates set forth above is not a criminal offense,
but may delay the applicant's project. Failure to acquire a required stormwater construction activity permit is grounds for denying a related subdivision
application, site plan application, conditional use permit application, or building permit application. It is unlawful to commence work (move dirt) on a
development site before obtaining a required stormwater construction activity permit.
D. Fee: The applicant for a stormwater construction activity permit shall pay a fee in an amount set by the city council in the fee schedule.
E. Application Approval: The city shall approve the application and grant the permit if the application is complete and meets the criteria set forth in section
9-4-4 of this chapter. The city shall deny the application or approve the application with conditions if the city determines that the measures proposed in
the plan fail to meet the criteria set forth in section 9-4-4 of this chapter. Conditions the city may impose in connection with the approval of a permit
include, but are not limited to, the establishment of specific measures and controls to prevent erosion and the discharge of sediment, debris and other
construction related pollutants from the site by stormwater.
F. Terms: Unless otherwise revoked or suspended, a stormwater construction activity permit shall be in effect for the full period of the construction activity.
The construction activity will not be considered to be completed until the following events occur:
1. Subdivisions: For permits associated with a subdivision plat approval:
a. The permittee must complete all required subdivision improvements; and
b. One of the following three (3) events must occur:
(1) The city issues a final certificate of occupancy for each lot in the subdivision, or
(2) Individual stormwater construction activity permits have been issued for each lot in the subdivision not having a final occupancy permit, or
(3) The property has been revegetated or landscaped in a manner that eliminates erosion and sediment discharge or that brings the property back
to its natural state.
2. Site Plan: For permits associated with a site plan approval, the date that the permittee has completed all required landscaping and all outside
construction work associated with the site plan.
3. Building Permit: For permits associated with a building permit application, the date that the city issues a final occupancy permit for the structure
covered by the building permit.
4. Other: For permits issued that are not tied to other approvals from the city, the date that the permittee has completed all work associated with the
permit and takes steps required by the permit to prevent further erosion and runoff from the site.
G. Termination: No stormwater construction activity permit shall be considered terminated until the permittee submits a notice of termination of construction
activity permit ("notice") to the city and the notice is accepted by the city. The city shall accept the notice if the permittee has met the requirements of
the permit and this chapter. The permittee shall keep and maintain all permit required improvements on the site until the city accepts the notice.
H. Amendments: In the event that the proposed construction activity for a site to which a permit pertains is materially altered from that described in an
original plan in a way that may have a significant impact upon the effectiveness of the measures and controls described in the original plan, the
permittee shall file an amended stormwater prevention plan which meets the criteria set forth in section 9-4-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 2008-16, 12-9-2008)
9-4-4: STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN:

1. Site Description: A site description (including a map with spot elevations and contour lines) which includes a description of the nature and location of
the construction activity, a description of the intended sequence of major activities which will disturb soils for major portions of the site (e.g., grubbing,
excavation, grading, utilities, and infrastructure installation, etc.), and estimates of the total area of the site and the total area of the site that is
expected to be disturbed by excavation, grading, or other activities;
2. Control Description: A description of the proposed measures and controls that will be implemented during construction activity and/or while the site is
not stable. The plan must clearly describe the times during the construction process that the measures will be implemented for each major activity
identified pursuant to subsection A1 of this section. The plan shall also state the name and phone number of the person or entity responsible for
implementation of each control measure.
B. Goals And Criteria: The proposed measures and controls described in the plan shall be designed to meet the following goals and criteria:
1. Prevent Or Minimize Discharge: The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable,
the discharge of sediment, debris and other construction related pollutants from the construction site by stormwater runoff into the storm drainage
system.
2. Prevent Or Minimize Construction Debris: The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent
practicable, the deposit, discharge, tracking by construction vehicles, or dropping of mud, sediment, debris or other potential pollutants onto public
streets and rights of way. Any such discharge shall be cleaned up and removed immediately upon notification to the permittee or when it otherwise
comes to the attention of the permittee. At a minimum, the deposit or discharge shall be cleaned and removed at the end of the work shift in which
the deposit occurred, or at the end of the workday, whichever comes first.
3. BMPs: The proposed measures and controls shall consist of best management practices (BMPs) available at the time that the plan is submitted.
BMPs may include, but shall not be limited to, temporary silt or sediment fences, sediment traps and detention ponds, gravel construction entrances
and wash down pads to reduce or eliminate off site tracking, straw bale sediment barriers, establishment of temporary grasses and permanent
vegetative cover, use of straw mulch as a temporary ground cover, erosion control blankets, temporary interceptor dikes and swales, storm drain inlet
protection, check dams, pipe slope drain, rock outlet protection, reinforced soil retaining systems, gabions.
4. Stabilization: The proposed measures and controls shall be designed to preserve existing vegetation, where possible. Disturbed portions of the site
shall be stabilized. Stabilization practices may include temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative
buffer strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures. Use of imperious surfaces for stabilization
should be avoided. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable in disturbed portions of the site where construction activities have
temporarily or permanently ceased, but in no case more than fourteen (14) days after the construction activity in that portion of the site that has
temporarily or permanently ceased, except under the following circumstances:
a. If the initiation of stabilization measures by the fourteenth day after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceases is precluded by snow
cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or
b. If construction activity on a portion of the site is temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing will resume within twenty one (21) days, temporary
stabilization measures need not be initiated on that portion of the site.
5. Minimize Risk Of Discharge Of Other Materials: The proposed measures and controls shall be employed to minimize the risk of discharge of
construction related pollutants (such as paint, thinners, solvents and other chemicals) from the construction site. Such measures may include
implementation of storage to minimize exposure of the material to stormwater as well as spill prevention and response. (Ord. 2008-16, 12-9-2008)

3. Inspection Of Table: In areas where soil conservation maps indicate high water tables and in all other questionable areas that might be designated

4. Table Elevations: All applications must supply data as to water table elevations.
5. Land Developers:
a. Drainage Easements: The land developer shall provide drainage easements along side or front lot lines as may be required for drainage purposes;

shall recommend whether the drainage easement shall be separated from other utility easements or shall be used concurrently with said
easements.
b. Drainage: The building official shall require the land developer to provide for adequate and proper drainage of subsurface water from the land
being developed. A registered engineer must engineer and plan all subsurface drain lines and two (2) copies of the plan for such drain lines must

use of subsurface water drainage without the written permission of the appropriate canal company or of the water users for such use. No ditch or
canal shall be used for subsurface water drainage unless adequately improved to handle such water as might be reasonably expected to flow from
the canal and ditch water, subsurface runoff water, subsurface water drainage and other water expected to reach such canal or ditch. No ditch,
canal or other open waterway shall be permitted within property dedicated or to be dedicated for public use. The land developer shall remove such
waterways from property to be so dedicated before the submission of the final plat.
6. Grading: All grading of any kind shall be done so as to ensure that the drainage is away from the proposed improvements and in such a manner as
to prevent any conveying or trapping of water adjacent to the basement and foundation walls of the improvement.
D. Failure To Comply: The building official is hereby given authority to revoke any building permits and/or certificates until the applicant shall comply with
the provisions of this section. (Ord. 2008-05, 7-22-2008)
10-1-5: OFF SITE IMPROVEMENTS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section shall be to promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of
the city to facilitate orderly growth and development of the city; and to establish the rights, duties and responsibilities of subdividers, contractors,
builders and owners with respect to land, subdivisions, buildings and construction of streets, gutters, sidewalks, curbs, sewers, culinary water facilities,
storm drains and other off site improvements.
B. Conditions For Permit Or License: Conditions for a permit or license for building or improvements must include establishing a bond for off site
improvements.
C. Granting Permit Or License: No city officer or agent shall grant any permit or license in any commercial, residential, industrial, manufacturing or other
zone for the construction of any building or the commencement of any improvements to any lot, tract or property where the same would be in violation
of title 12, chapter 9 of this code.
D. Fees: A fee shall be charged for installation of off site improvements in accordance with the city's current consolidated fee schedule. The full amount
shall be collected when the permit is issued and shall be paid in cash or check. The contractor shall have one year from completion of the project to
have all off site improvements installed and accepted by the city. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of the fee. (Ord. 2008-05, 7-22-2008)

the city council with authority to act upon a land use application in accordance with the provisions of this title. (Ord. 2009-17, 11-24-2009)
11-1-12: APPEAL AUTHORITY:
A. Regulations: Section 11-1-3, table 11.1, "Land Use And Appeal Authority", of this chapter identifies the appeal authority and time limit for appeal for
each type of land use application. Aggrieved applicants may appeal the decision of the land use authority to the appeal authority within the specified
time limit. Appeals shall be filed by a written statement submitted to the city recorder detailing the grounds upon which the aggrieved applicant is
appealing the land use authority's decision. Upon receipt of such an appeal it shall be placed on the next available appeal authority's agenda for which
the item may be reasonably scheduled. The following provisions apply generally to appeals to land use applications and decisions:
1. The appellant may only allege the land use authority erred in administering or applying the ordinance.
2. The appellant has burden of proof.
3. All theories whereby an appellant would appeal are raised to the appeal authority before appealing to district court.
4. Legislative decisions shall be valid if reasonably debatable and not illegal.
5. Administrative or quasi-judicial decisions shall be valid if supported by substantial evidence and not illegal.
B. Right Of Appeal: Any person aggrieved by, or any officer, department, council, commission, board or bureau of the city affected by, any decision of the
planning and zoning administrator, planning commission, or city council in the administration of this title, may appeal such decision in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
C. Stay Of Proceedings: An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the planning and zoning administrator, planning
commission, or city council certifies to the appeal authority, as appropriate, that by reason of facts stated a stay would, in their opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the appropriate
appeal authority or by the district court on application and notice and on due cause shown.
D. Hearing: The appeal authority shall schedule a hearing for the appeal at a public meeting. Upon hearing the appeal and reviewing all relevant
information submitted, the appeal body may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and may make such determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the land use authority. The appeal
authority may continue the hearing at a later time and date, as is reasonable and as may be necessary. A concurring vote of a simple majority of the
total membership of the appeal authority shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement or determination of the land use authority.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 216/359
E. Judicial Appeals: Any person aggrieved by, or affected by, any decision of the city council on a land use application may have and maintain a plenary
action for relief therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction, provided petition for such relief is presented to the court within thirty (30) calendar days
after the decision.
F. Fee: The appellant of a decision on a land use application by city staff or the planning commission shall pay the fee specified in the city's current
consolidated fee schedule. (Ord. 2009-17, 11-24-2009)
11-1-13: VARIANCES:
A. Any person or their authorized agent desiring a waiver or modification of the requirements of the land use ordinance as applied to a parcel of property
that he or she owns, leases, or in which holds some other beneficial interest, may apply to the planning commission for a variance from the terms of the
land use ordinance.
1. The planning commission may grant a variance only if:
a. Literal enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause an unreasonable hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the
general purpose of the ordinance;
b. There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not generally apply to other properties in the same zone;
c. Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zone;
d. The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will not be contrary to the public interest; and
e. The spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial justice done.
2. In determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection A1 of this section, the
planning commission may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship:
a. Is located on or associated with the property for which the variance is sought; and
b. Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from conditions that are general to the neighborhood.
3. In determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection A1 of this section, the
planning commission may not find an unreasonable hardship if the hardship is self-imposed or economic. A self-imposed hardship inflicted on a
property by action of a previous owner shall not be reason for granting a variance to the current owner.
4. In determining whether or not there are special circumstances attached to the property under subsection A1 of this section, the planning commission
may find that special circumstances exist only if the special circumstances:
a. Relate to the hardship complained of; and
b. Deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in the same zone.
B. The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions justifying a variance have been met.
C. Variances run with the land.
D. The planning commission and any other body may not grant use variances.
E. In granting a variance, the planning commission may impose additional requirements on the applicant that will:
1. Mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
2. Serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived or modified. (Ord. 2009-17, 11-24-2009)
11-1-14: ANNEXATION:
A. The proposed annexation area shall substantially comply with the requirements of title 10 of Utah Code Annotated.
B. The proposed annexation area shall substantially comply with the policies established by the city's general plan to the extent that it may address the
same, including the city's annexation policy declaration unless determined otherwise by the city council. Any failure to comply therewith will not
invalidate any action taken by the city council or create a cause of action.
C. The procedures for annexation into the city shall substantially comply with those set forth in state law currently in effect, or as it may be amended from
time to time. (Ord. 2009-17, 11-24-2009)
D. The city may establish forms and procedures for applications/petitions for annexation to the city in addition to those set forth by state law. (Ord. 2015-
19, 12-8-2015)
E. The fee for annexation shall be in accordance with the city's current consolidated fee schedule.

uses should also operate primarily during normal daytime business hours and not generate objectionable noise, odors, dust or fumes which could
otherwise be incompatible with the residential uses being buffered. It is not intended that the buffer zone be considered as just another commercial or
industrial zone with which to strip zone existing traffic corridors, nor is it intended that the buffer zone allow large amounts of commercial or light industrial
property to compete with the existing and established commercial and industrial zoned areas of the city. The permitted uses contained in this buffer zone
are intended to be generally acceptable anywhere the buffer zone is established and could be generally acceptable as an immediately adjacent
neighboring property to a low density single-family residence. The conditional uses contained in this buffer zone are intended to be those uses which are
acceptable within the buffer zone, but may not be generally acceptable as an immediately adjacent neighboring property to single-family residence and,
therefore, must be considered on a site specific basis. (Ord. 2009-34, 11-24-2009)

ARTICLE F. MIXED USE ZONE (MU)
11-11F-1: PURPOSE:
A. The mixed use (MU) zoning district is intended to provide a variety of land uses that are purposely combined. Mixed use areas are intended to support a
broad range of commercial, office, entertainment, recreational, civic and residential uses within single buildings (vertical mixed use), or within
neighborhoods (horizontal mixed use). The mixed use zoning permits nonresidential development (i.e., commercial or employment), or nonresidential
and residential development, but it does not permit residential development without a substantial nonresidential component.
B. The following objectives are among those sought to be accomplished in the MU zone:
1. To assist in the fulfillment of the goals, objectives and policies of the Clearfield City master plan and any amendments thereto.
2. To accommodate variations in building design, lot arrangements and land uses that are of high quality.
3. To provide for a coordinated and compatibly arranged variety of land uses through innovative site planning.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 269/359
4. To provide a maximum choice in the types of environments for commercial, employment, and residential uses and facilities.
5. To encourage an efficient and safe traffic circulation, including the separation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic.
6. To encourage economy in the construction and maintenance of streets and utilities.
7. To encourage the provision of usable open space.
8. To maintain a reasonable quality of living standard and minimize adverse environmental impact on surrounding areas during development. (Ord.
2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-2: AREA REQUIREMENTS:
The minimum area of an MU zone shall be forty (40) acres. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-3: LOCATION:
MU developments shall be located at transportation nodes and along transportation corridors and other locations where "walkable" components (e.g.,
housing choices, convenience commercial, employment community facilities, transportation linkages, parks or other open space, schools, churches) are
already present, planned, or where the size and scale of development is such that said components can be provided within the project itself. The location
of the MU zone shall typically be within a quarter (1/4) mile, or a five (5) minute walking distance, of the elements described above. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-
2013)
11-11F-4: OWNERSHIP:
The development shall either be entirely owned by a single legal entity (whether by an individual, partnership or other corporate entity), or under option to
purchase by such at the time of the application; otherwise, the application shall be filed jointly by all owners of the property. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-5: ZONE ESTABLISHMENT:
A. Master Development Plan (MDP): Each proposed MU zone shall be accompanied by a master development plan ("MDP"), a document prepared by the
applicant, which shall incorporate the provisions below and include, at minimum, the following items:
1. Project area.
2. Land use regulation plan.
3. Residential and nonresidential acreage, density, units and square footage.
4. Permitted uses and conditional uses.
5. Development standards (as described in this article).
6. Maximum building heights.
7. Circulation and roads (e.g., delineating private and public).
8. Architectural controls (i.e., conceptual building elevations and design schemes).
9. Parking and loading standards.
10. Open and public spaces.
11. Phasing plan.
12. Sign standards.
B. Purpose Of MDP: An MDP is intended to create well designed, pedestrian oriented, economically viable neighborhoods, and achieve the related goals
and objectives identified in the city's master plan, particularly for the mixed use land use classification.
C. Requirements Of MDP: An MDP should be a graphically oriented development code, clearly describing the required urban and architectural design
patterns, while also carefully regulating the uses of the buildings and lots within the project area. An MDP should also specify the allowed residential
densities and intensity of the development that may be achieved for the entire project area. It should also describe and regulate the design of the public
space network that provides the framework and infrastructure for the specified MU zoned property, focusing on a circulation network that balances the
use of all travel modes, including automobiles, pedestrians, bicycles and transit.
D. Protection Provisions: In the development of the MDP in the mixed use (MU) zone the following provisions shall be considered in order to protect the
intended characteristics of the zone:
1. Development Standards: Standards, including the following, but not limited to, area and frontage regulations, yard requirements, height regulations,
lot coverage, parking, loading and access shall be established in the zoning amendment process (pursuant to chapter 6 of this title) in conjunction
with a submitted and approved MDP.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 270/359
2. Mixture Of Unit Type: The blend or mixture of residential unit type (e.g., condominiums, apartments, twin homes, single-family, unit size, etc.), within
a development shall be determined depending upon the size, scale, and location of the project. Housing units shall include a mix of housing types,
housing size, and number of bedrooms.
3. Traffic: The applicant shall demonstrate that all potential traffic concerns regarding existing intersections, substandard streets, inadequate
improvements, and access are mitigated to the city's satisfaction. As determined by the city engineer, a traffic study may be required.
4. Surrounding Properties: The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that sufficient measures have been incorporated into the
development plan to assure that adjacent properties will not experience significant impacts as a result of the proposed development.
5. Pedestrian Realm: In order to achieve an overall "walkable" development, appropriate land uses, pedestrian connections, cross easements,
common driveways, consistent site standards, etc., must be coordinated within the respective MU zone area, even though properties may be
individually owned.
E. Minimum And Exclusive Standards: The requirements of an MDP regarding site development, massing, materials, construction methods, forms and
colors are mandatory; standards that do not meet these requirements are not acceptable. The requirements for an MDP are minimum standards for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare in a mixed use zoning district.
F. Conformance To MDP: Phased developments and approved individual plats and site plans shall conform to the adopted MDP. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-6: ADOPTION BY ORDINANCE:
A. Execution: The MDP shall be adopted by ordinance, establishing the MU zone district, for a given property or project area. A development agreement
between the city and the applicant may be required by the city council and executed before the zoning designation shall be effective.
B. Municipal Code Provisions: The MDP adopted by ordinance will be considered a subpart of this title and be identified by MDP project name.
C. Relationship Of Master Development Plan To Municipal Code:
1. Municipal Code And Zoning Ordinance Provision: An adopted MDP is a subpart of the zoning ordinance. As is the case with other provisions of the
zoning ordinance, all other provisions of this code continue to apply within an approved MDP.
2. Conflict Between MDP And The Zoning Ordinance: If a conflict occurs between a requirement or other provision of an adopted MDP and a
requirement or other provision of the zoning ordinance, the provision of the MDP shall control regardless of whether the MDP provision is more
liberal or more restrictive. In any instance where there is no conflict between a requirement of an adopted MDP and a requirement or other provision
of the zoning ordinance because a development related subject is addressed in the zoning ordinance, but not in the MDP, the zoning ordinance
provision shall apply.
3. Conflict Between MDP And Municipal Code: In any instance where there is no conflict between a requirement of MDP and a requirement or other
provision of this code because a regulatory subject is addressed elsewhere in this code, but not in an adopted MDP, such as, by way of example, but
without limitation, the home occupation requirements set forth in chapter 16 of this title, the municipal code provision is intended to, and shall, apply.
(Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-7: FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL:
A. Findings: The planning commission must make the following findings to approve a recommendation to the city council for rezoning the property to the
MU zone:
1. The MDP is consistent with the statement of objectives of a mixed use (MU) zone contained in this article.
2. To the extent that the MDP departs from zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the property (including, but not limited to, density,
bulk and use) it is nevertheless still consistent with adopted master plan land use maps and policies. Architectural controls and other quality
measurements of design are clearly articulated in the MDP.
3. The ratio of residential to nonresidential uses in the planned development is consistent with the master plan; specifically, that the MDP provides a
substantial nonresidential component in comparison with the residential uses proposed.
4. The proposed development can be adequately served by public facilities and complies with the minimum design criteria for these public facilities,
including, but not limited to, water, storm drain, sewer, and roads. Any upgrades or necessary improvements to public facilities have been clearly
identified and the responsibility of construction and costs will not be incurred by the city.
5. Any development related adverse impacts, such as traffic, noise, orders, visual nuisances, or other similar adverse effects to adjacent development
and neighborhoods, are mitigated by improvements or modifications either on site or within the public right of way.
6. The common open space provided in the MDP exceeds the minimum area and improvement standards.

thorough analysis and adequate documentation of the impact the zoning may have on the city's public schools.
B. Length Of Approval: Construction, as defined by the building code, will be required to commence within two (2) years of the date of the approval of the
MDP. After construction commences, the MDP shall remain valid as long as it is consistent with the approved specific project phasing plan as set forth
in the MDP. It is anticipated that the specific project phasing may require planning commission review and reevaluation of the project at specified points
in the development of the project. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-8: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW:
A. As determined through the MDP approval, portions of the project area that are specifically given site plan approval will proceed directly to the building
and engineering permitting process (pursuant to section 11-2-3 of this title). Portions of the project that are not identified as obtaining site plan approval
at the time of the MDP approval, will proceed through the site plan approval process (pursuant to section 11-5-1 of this title).
B. Should at any time, the determination be made by the zoning administrator, or assigned designee, that submitted construction documents are not in
substantial conformance with the approved MDP, the submittal will be referred to and reviewed by the planning commission and will follow the
modification procedures as outlined in this article.
C. Construction without approval is prohibited. No building or zoning permit shall be issued for any use under an MU zoning designation prior to approval
of the MDP as prescribed herein. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)
11-11F-9: MODIFICATIONS OR AMENDMENTS:
A. Modifications to an adopted MDP, which constitute a change in concept, land use, density, unit type, or configuration of any portion or phase of the MDP
will justify review of the amendments by the planning commission and the city council.

a recommendation to the city council on whether the proposed modifications are of a material change to the MDP. City council will make a final
determination on whether the proposed modifications constitute a material change.
2. If the proposed modification is determined by the city council to be of a material change, the project will be required to go through the zoning
amendment process as outlined in chapter 6 of this title and pay applicable application and review fees. An amended MDP will be required to be
adopted by ordinance.
B. Future changes of use on developed properties in the MU zone may still be subject to site plan or conditional use approval. (Ord. 2013-01, 1-8-2013)

limbs to stubs larger than three inches (3") in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the
tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other cause, or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted from
this subsection at the determination of the city arborist.
F. Pruning, Corner Clearance: Every owner of any tree or shrub overhanging any street, sidewalk or right of way within the city shall prune the branches so
that such branches shall not severely obstruct the light from any streetlamp, obstruct the view of any street intersection or obstruct and create a hazard
on a sidewalk. Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees and shrubs, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to
the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with visibility of any traffic control
device, sign or sight triangle at intersections or constitutes a hazard on a sidewalk. Any costs incurred by the city will be collected from the adjacent
property owner.
G. Appeal: Any person may appeal a decision of the city arborist to the community service director, who may hear the matter and make a final decision
within sixty (60) days. (Ord. 2009-40, 11-24-2009)

A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to authorize beekeeping subject to certain requirements intended to avoid problems that may otherwise be
associated with beekeeping in populated areas.
B. Hives On Lots:
1. As provided in this section, and notwithstanding any contrary provision in this title, an apiary, located on lots that are up to one-fourth (1/4) acre shall
consist of not more than three (3) hives. Lots that are one-fourth (1/4) acre, not to exceed one-half (1/2) acre shall consist of no more than five (5)
hives. On any residential lot which is one-half (1/2) acre up to one acre, the number of hives permitted on the lot may be increased to ten (10) hives.
Lots that meet the zoning designation and are greater than one acre do not have an imposed limit on the number of hives.
2. No hives shall be located in a front yard.
3. A person shall not locate or allow a hive on property owned or occupied by another person without first obtaining written permission from the owner.
4. No hive or group of hives shall exceed six feet (6') in height.

property line on the lot where an apiary is located, as measured from the nearest point on the hive to the property line, a flyway barrier at least six feet
(6') in height shall be established and maintained around the hive except as needed to allow access. Such flyway shall consist of a solid wall, fence,
dense foliage or a combination thereof, which extends at least ten feet (10') beyond the hive in each direction so that bees are forced to fly to an
elevation of at least six feet (6') above ground level over property lines in the vicinity of the apiary.
F. Water: Each beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient source of water is available to the colony continuously between March 1 and October 31 of each

SIGN REGULATIONS
11-15-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and to authorize the use of signs that are compatible with their surroundings, are legible under the circumstances
in which they are seen, are effective in indexing the environment, are conducive to promoting traffic safety, and for the convenience and enjoyment of
public travel by preventing visual distraction, protecting pedestrians, preserving and enhancing property values, establishing first class business and
commercial districts, and eliminating fire hazards.
It is also the purpose of this chapter to promote short and long term civic beauty and order by establishing standards and regulations for sign design,
location, size, type, compatibility, and aesthetics. By doing so, this chapter will help to create streetscapes that are functional and attractive to both
residents of Clearfield City and visitors. (Ord. 2009-45, 11-24-2009)
11-15-2: SCOPE:
The intent of this chapter is to regulate the design and placement of residential, commercial and governmental identification/communication devices and
structures that are built specifically to identify, inform, and direct patrons to a particular merchant, store, establishment, or service. It is not the intent of this
chapter to regulate the content of public speech. The requirements of this chapter are intended to apply to both on premises and off premises signs, but do
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

not apply to handheld placards and other similar devices traditionally used for public protest and the exercise of free speech. Any noncommercial message
may be substituted for any commercial message permitted under this chapter. Any sign not expressly allowed by this chapter is prohibited. (Ord. 2009-45,
11-24-2009)
11-15-3: INTERPRETATION:
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, the sign regulations contained herein are declared to be the maximum allowable for the
purposes set forth. If the zoning administrator determines that an application needs further interpretation, he may request planning commission review of
the proposal.
If the applicant wishes to propose or retain a sign that exceeds ordinance standards, he may apply to the planning commission for a variance or special

1. Requires a building or other permit issued by the city;
2. Increases required parking; or
3. Increases the amount of outside storage.
C. Imposition Of Conditions: In approving a site plan, the planning commission may impose conditions consistent with the purpose and intent of this title.
D. Standards And Guidelines: This chapter establishes two (2) kinds of design criteria: design standards and design guidelines. They are intended to
improve the quality and compatibility of development, particularly with regard to building design and site design. These criteria apply to all
nonresidential projects and are the minimum that will be accepted.
1. Design Standards: Design standards are required in addition to other standards set forth in this title and are indicated by the verb "shall". Design
standards are intended to ensure quality development and permanence in design. The implementation of these standards ensures that the goals and
values of the community are reflected in each commercial development and contribute positively to the overall built environment. To better clarify
these standards, a set of design guidelines may accompany and explain each standard.

2. Design Guidelines: Design guidelines are utilized in building and site design to meet the required standards set forth in this chapter. They indicate
additional actions that may be taken to enhance development design and achieve greater compatibility with adjacent land uses. Guidelines use the
verb "should" (rather than "shall"), signifying that they are desirable objectives. Application of the guidelines will depend on the nature of the
proposed site plans and the surrounding area, as may be determined by the planning commission. (Ord. 2010-04, 1-26-2010)
11-18-3: DEVIATIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE:
A. Deviations Authorized: In all applicable cases the design standards contained in this chapter shall be met, except as determined by the planning
commission. Deviations from strict compliance of the standards listed in this chapter may be authorized if the planning commission makes the findings
listed in subsection B of this section.
B. Findings Required: The planning commission may authorize a deviation from the standards listed in this chapter if it finds the deviation:
1. Is consistent with the purpose of this chapter and any applicable master plan or ordinance;
2. Will not adversely affect neighboring property owners or residents; and
3. Reflects an innovative or unique design that conforms to the requirements of this chapter to the greatest extent possible and offers alternatives for
addressing the intent of the requirements of this chapter; or is required to create a consistent and compatible design in cases which involve the
following:
a. Redeveloped buildings;
b. Additions to existing buildings;
c. Minor structures added to a site; or
d. New buildings within a previously approved phased project. (Ord. 2010-04, 1-26-2010)
11-18-4: SITE DESIGN STANDARDS:
A. Building Placement: The following standards shall be carefully considered as part of the overall development review:
1. All buildings shall be located with the main facade facing the principal street to which it has frontage.
2. Buildings located on corner lots shall orient main facades to each street and give equal treatment to each.
3. Buildings located on corner lots should include a prominent architectural feature of greater height or emphasis at the corner where the two (2) public
streets meet.
4. Buildings should be located as close to the front property line considering site, use, and other constraints or requirements.
5. Main entrances shall be oriented toward the street rather than parking in cases where buildings can be located adjacent to the public right of way.
B. Context: New development shall consider the site design and building placement of surrounding development in order to create a site which relates to
its surroundings and adds positively to the overall built environment in the site area. Additionally all developments shall consider natural features, such
as view corridors, water channels, topography, and vegetation, as integral features to be preserved, enhanced, and which will contribute to the site.
C. Miscellaneous Site Considerations: The following considerations shall be made during initial site planning:
1. Service And Loading Bays: Landscaped areas and walls shall be used to decrease noise levels and separate loading and service bays from
customer parking where possible. Service and loading bays (automotive, service, tire, etc.) should be oriented away from neighboring residential
areas and major public streets. The general public should be restricted from accessing such areas when possible.
2. Outdoor Refuse And Garbage Collection Containers: Outdoor refuse and garbage collection containers shall be fully screened from view using the
same materials as the building or approved masonry fencing. Enclosures shall also be surrounded by landscaping to further soften their visual
impact. The general public shall be restricted from accessing such areas.
3. Generators; Large Auxiliary Equipment: Generators and other large auxiliary equipment shall be placed at locations where they will be least intrusive
in terms of noise, appearance, and odors, particularly for occupants of neighboring properties. Site plans should also consider public utilities
equipment placement and communicate early in the planning process with the various public utility providers about potential utility equipment
placement on the site.
a. Equipment should be kept low to the ground.
b. Exhaust systems shall not protrude above the equipment.
c. Walls, landscaping, and other screening shall be used.
4. Open Spaces: The locations of all buildings and structures shall allow and provide an interconnected system of open space allowing open space and
landscaping areas to connect with similar open spaces and landscaping areas existing, or planned to be located, on adjacent properties.
5. Chainlink Fencing: Chainlink fencing shall not be permitted adjacent to a public right of way or in a required front yard.
6. Utilities: All utility distribution facilities, including electrical, telecommunications, and natural gas services shall be placed underground. Transformers,
terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals and other necessary appurtenances to the underground facilities may be placed aboveground where
necessary.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 314/359
D. Landscaping: Landscaping shall be used as a tool to enhance and beautify the site.
1. Outdoor amenities shall be provided for every development on a site with a combined building floor area totaling twenty thousand (20,000) square
feet or greater. Outdoor amenities are designed for pedestrians and create plazas or other focal points that are inviting to site patrons. These
amenities shall be located near entrances or other focal points within the development where they will be convenient and comfortable for users.
Restaurants and other similar uses are encouraged to provide additional outdoor seating areas for their patrons, but shall not include these areas as
an outdoor amenity if restricted to only paying customers. Outdoor amenities may include the following:
a. Seating areas including patios, decks, porches, benches, tables, and pergolas;
b. Water features;
c. Garden areas designed for active use.
2. Landscaping shall be integrated into the design, placement, and enhancement of pedestrian plazas, sitting areas, walkways, flagpoles, and signs.
This may be accomplished by giving special attention to any plantings immediately adjacent to pedestrian areas and walkways. This landscaping
shall not overgrow or impede pedestrian areas, but rather allow for detail and aesthetics more amenable to pedestrians.
3. Drought resistant shrubs and trees are encouraged wherever possible in conjunction with efficient low water use irrigation systems.
4. All proposed plants and landscape materials shall be consistent with (but not uniform) and of a similar scale with existing natural landscape,
neighboring landscape, and adjacent streetscape areas where appropriate. Drought tolerant plant materials are encouraged. Landscaping
improvements may also include berming, contouring, rocks, and boulders.
5. The size and spacing of landscape elements shall be consistent and establish a coordinated relationship to any existing or proposed streetscape
plantings. The size and spacing of landscape elements shall also be of appropriate scale and character to all proposed site structures and features.
E. Lighting: All exterior lighting shall provide for the illumination of buildings and grounds for safety purposes, but in an aesthetic manner. All exterior
lighting shall be reduced to the minimum levels necessary for safety and security purposes. The use of motion sensors and timers is encouraged.
1. Lighting schemes should include coordinating parking, wall, and pedestrian scaled fixtures which complement building architecture and site features.
2. Sensitively placed low light landscape lighting that highlights a site's desirable features is encouraged.
3. All off street parking area lighting shall be designed and installed to meet the following minimum requirements:
a. All lighting fixtures and poles shall be a decorative nature and painted a color as approved with site plan application.
b. The height of all lighting poles shall not exceed twenty feet (20'), measured to the top of the pole or luminary.
c. All light fixtures, including security lighting, shall be fully hooded or shielded and aimed and so that all direct illumination shall be confined to the
property boundaries of the source. All motion sensing light fixtures shall be fully shielded and adjusted, according to the manufacturer's
specifications, to turn off when detected motion ceases.
4. The following types of lighting shall be prohibited:
a. Exposed bulb fixtures;
b. Directional floodlights; and
c. Excessive or intense lighting of any kind.
5. Indoor lighting shall not be provided or constructed to provide lighting for any outdoor areas.
F. Parking And Circulation: The following measures shall be taken to ensure that needed parking areas are designed in such a way as to have a minimal
impact on the built environment as possible:
1. Developments which generate significant increases in traffic should include an analysis of the proposed development's impact on the current and
future transportation system, and methods to control such traffic.
2. Major internal circulation roadways that provide access from the public right of way or between buildings on the same site shall be separated from
parking areas using curb and gutter and a combination of any of the following methods:
a. Landscaping;
b. Pedestrian walkways; or
c. Lighting.
3. Pedestrian walkways shall be a minimum of five feet (5') wide.
4. Cross access for automobiles and pedestrians to future and existing commercial developments shall be provided during initial site planning and
construction, and be maintained in perpetuity.
5. The location and number of access points to the site, the interior circulation pattern, and the separation between pedestrians and vehicles shall be
designed to maximize safety and convenience, and should be harmonious with proposed and neighboring buildings.
G. Pedestrian Considerations: Site layout and design shall consider with equal weight the needs of pedestrians and automobiles. Measures shall be taken
to ensure adequate access and safety for pedestrians on the site.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 315/359
1. Pedestrian access from the public right of way through the site to main entrances shall be provided. These walkways shall be constructed of different
materials than the roadway or parking area, and provide for clearly defined crossings where there are points of conflict with automobiles.
2. Similar pedestrian access from public transit stations and stops into the site and to each building entrance shall be provided.
3. Differing roadway materials within parking lots shall be used directly in front of entrances to slow motorists and create a safer environment for
pedestrians.
4. Pedestrian drop off locations shall be convenient and safe for pedestrians.
5. Benches, pedestrian scaled lighting, bike racks, and other pedestrian amenities shall be placed appropriately throughout the site.
H. Security: Security of the site and CPTED (crime prevention through environmental design) principles should be considered in any site design. Many of
the goals of CPTED are supported by and accomplished through following the standards and guidelines already enumerated in this chapter. In addition
to these standards and guidelines, other measures should be considered with the following four (4) overlapping CPTED principles in mind:
1. Territoriality is a design concept that plainly demarcates private space from semipublic and public areas. Clear territoriality in the design of a site also
creates a sense of ownership wherein people will be more likely to defend and care for such spaces. Following this principle ultimately creates an
environment where intruders stand out and are more easily identified.
a. Symbolic barriers such as landscaping or changes in paving materials or patterns can be effective in creating defined public spaces.
b. Spaces which are designed for active use such as plazas, outdoor seating and eating areas, benches, fountains, and playgrounds add to the
sense of ownership.
2. Natural surveillance is a design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation. Provision of natural surveillance helps create
environments where there is sufficient opportunity for people engaged in their normal behavior to observe the space around them. Areas can be
designed so they are more easily observed through:
a. Landscape designs and follow up maintenance that allows for clear, unobstructed views of accessible areas;
b. Walkways which are visible, well lit, and overlooked by windows from nearby buildings;
c. Mixed uses that engage a site at all hours;
d. Use of unglazed or tinted windows and doors; and
e. Lighting of alcoves, stairwells, and other areas which may otherwise provide concealment.
3. Access control is a design concept directed primarily at decreasing criminal accessibility. Provision of natural access control limits access and
increases natural surveillance to restrict criminal intrusion, especially into areas where they will not be easily observed through:
a. Clearly marking entrances;
b. Restricting access to screened areas such as garbage receptacles, delivery areas, and outdoor storage areas; and
c. Eliminating design elements which allow access to roofs and upper levels.
4. Proper maintenance of landscaping, lighting treatments, and other features can facilitate the principles of CPTED.
I. Signs: The primary purpose of signs is to clearly identify businesses. Signs shall be integrated into the overall design of a commercial development
including materials, and shall add to the quality of the built environment without contributing to visual clutter. While the approval of signs requires a
separate review and approval process, their placement should be planned for during initial site planning and provide for required landscaping, lighting,
and other related considerations.
J. Noise Impact: Site design shall include provisions and strategies for limiting noise, particularly to adjacent property. The occupants of a proposed
development should be protected from noise from both outside and within the site through screening, setbacks, and building materials. Noise
generating equipment shall be located and buffered to minimize potential on site and off site impacts.
K. Screening Walls, Fences, And Other Visual Barriers: Walls, fences, and barriers that create a continuous surface greater than twenty feet (20') in length
shall be softened visually with acceptable landscaping. All walls and fences shall conform to the major architectural style of the site plan. (Ord. 2010-
04, 1-26-2010)
11-18-5: BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS:
A. Context: All building designs shall consider surrounding or nearby buildings and developments and implement design solutions which are sensitive to
those nearby buildings and developments. The review of this requirement shall be based on the following:
1. The buildings contribute positively to the overall character of the city and the neighborhood in which it is located;
2. The buildings reflect the character of surrounding development through the use of similar positive and desirable features;
3. The buildings demonstrate imaginative design; and
4. Where proposed building designs closely copy or mirror surrounding development, the buildings vary colors, materials, or architectural elements.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 316/359
B. Entrances: All building entrances shall be clearly articulated to indicate a transition from the exterior to the interior of the building. Every main entrance
shall have a special emphasis when compared to the other portions of the building. This shall be accomplished through the use of at least three (3) of
the following near entrances:
1. A prominent architectural feature that is unique to the overall building design;
2. Complementary yet differing building materials or colors;
3. Increased use of windows or glass;
4. Pedestrian amenities that may include patios, porches, special paving treatments, seating areas, or awnings; or
5. Increased landscaping.
C. Facade Articulation: Buildings designed with completely flat facades and monotone color schemes shall not be permitted. All buildings shall
demonstrate articulation of all facades.
1. Horizontal or vertical facade variations shall occur at least every thirty feet (30') or along a minimum of sixty percent (60%) of the horizontal length of
buildings with facades one hundred feet (100') or greater. This shall be accomplished by using methods such as:
a. Variation in the surface plane that may include pop outs, bays, and recesses;
b. Variation in the surface pattern such as arches, banding, and paneling; or
c. Distinguished treatment of windows, doors, and eaves that may include molding or framing.
2. Buildings with facades one hundred feet (100') or greater in total length shall have at least one significant facade variation from the primary wall
plane whose depth is at least five percent (5%) of the total facade length and whose width is at least twenty percent (20%) of the total facade length.
There shall be no uninterrupted facades one hundred feet (100') or greater in length.
D. Height And Roofline: All buildings shall demonstrate an appropriate roof height that is compatible with the building's location, and vary rooflines in order
to add architectural interest and avoid the appearance or sense of monotonous roofline expanses. All buildings shall:
1. Demonstrate appropriate roof height for the location based on zoning regulations and the height of buildings within the immediate area;
2. Provide roofline and parapet variations where there are long, continuous, and undisturbed rooflines fifty feet (50') or greater;
3. Use similar materials and colors on the back of false fronts, parapets, cornices, or other parts of the building which extend beyond the roofline or
main building so that the building appears cohesive from all views; and
4. Provide for screening of mechanical equipment and systems that need to be mounted on the roof. Any minimal portion of these pieces of equipment
that may not be fully shielded shall be painted a color which is compatible with the roofing or parapet materials.
E. Massing: Buildings shall have a composition which clearly relates to surrounding buildings, as well as to the overall scale of the built environment in
nearby residential or commercial neighborhoods. Proper massing reduces the impact of the massive bulk created by large buildings that may not
otherwise relate in scale to surrounding development. Vertical articulation, horizontal articulation, and multi-planed roof and awning designs should be
used to mitigate the impact that may occur on surrounding development and the overall landscape.
F. Materials: High quality, long lasting materials shall be required for all buildings in order to contribute to the aesthetics of the community over the long
term. Permanence in design and construction will add to the overall value and sustainability of the community.
1. A minimum of three (3) colors per elevation shall be required.
2. Color utilization should be sensitive to existing development within the vicinity and the natural landscape in which the project is situated.
3. All projects shall submit a sample board containing actual samples of all exterior surface materials, including roofing materials, in all the colors that
will be used. No photos shall be permitted.
G. Pedestrian Considerations: All buildings shall consider pedestrians as an integral part of the design. Additionally, buildings that contain more than one
story or that are taller than twenty feet (20') in height shall provide a clearly articulated and more detailed base that relates to pedestrians.
H. Windows: The majority of windows shall relate to the scale of the person.
1. Windows should be at eye level when possible and provide for transparency into the building.
2. Where buildings are adjacent to pedestrian walkways, transparent windows shall be used to relate the scale of the building and the building's interior
to pedestrians. Where transparent windows may not be desirable, tinted windows, false windows, or glass block shall be used.
3. Window awnings are an effective way to add detail and variation to a building, emphasize pedestrian scale windows, and create an exciting and
inviting environment. When placing awnings:
a. Quality materials shall be used which are durable and are able to withstand extremes in the weather;
b. Colors should be complementary to the color of the building on which the awning is located; and
c. Styles should be compatible with the architectural features and overall architecture of the building on which the awning is located.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 317/359
I. Architectural Details: Surface details, ornaments, and other building elements that enrich the character of a building shall be provided. Attention to detail,
including all building and architectural design elements shall be required. The following architectural details are desirable and encouraged:
1. Stonework;
2. Exposed beams and columns;
3. Cornices, moldings, bands, pop outs, decorative vents, cast or sculpted features;
4. Covered walkways, breezeways, bays, and balconies;
5. Courtyards and patios;
6. Wide roof overhangs; and
7. Accessories such as art features, benches, pots, lamps, artwork, and sculptures.
J. Building Additions: All additions to existing buildings shall incorporate the predominant architectural features, materials, and colors of the existing
building. (Ord. 2010-04, 1-26-2010)

necessary to a point designated by the Planning Commission. Such walkways shall be a minimum of four feet (4') in width, but may be required to be
wider where determined necessary by the Planning Commission. The subdivider shall surface the full width of the walkway with concrete surface,
install a chainlink fence or its equal, four feet (4') high on each side and the full length of each walkway and provide, in accordance with the
standards and rules and regulations, barriers at each walkway entrance to prevent the use of the walkway by any motor vehicle or by any other
nonmotorized vehicle wider than four feet (4').
4. Business Or Industrial Uses: Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be designed specifically for such purposes with adequate space set
aside for off-street parkingand delivery facilities as specified in Title 11 of this Code.
B. Lots:
1. Arrangement: The lot arrangement and design shall be such that the lots will provide satisfactory and desirable sites for buildings and be properly
related to topography, to the character of surrounding development and to existing requirements.

Code for the zone in which the subdivision is located.
3. Adjoin Street: Each lot shall abut on a street shown on the subdivision plat or on an existing publicly-dedicated street, which has become public by
right of use and which is more than twenty six feet (26') wide. Double frontage lots shall be prohibited, except where unusual conditions make other
designs undesirable (i.e., the backing of lots on a major street with limited access).
4. Access Strips: Where it is impractical to extend streets to serve lots and the Planning Commission so determines, paved access strips not less than
fourteen feet (14') in width may be provided in lieu of streets. No portion of any strip shall be located at a distance greater than two hundred feet
(200') from the nearest street or highway, such distance being measured along the center line of the strip. Such strip shall provide access only to the

Chapter 1
AUTHORITY, FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
13-1-1: FINDINGS OF FACT:
A. Periodic Inundation: The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Cumulative Effect Of Obstructions: These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which
increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed,
elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 89-1, 1-10-1989)
13-1-2: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this Title to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to
specific areas by provisions designed:
A. Protection: To protect human life and health;
B. Minimize Expenditures: To minimize expenditure of public monies for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize Need For Rescue Efforts: To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense
of the general public;
D. Minimize Interruptions: To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize Damage: To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Maintain Stable Tax Base: To help maintain a stable taxbase by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to
minimize future flood blight areas;
G. Notification To Potential Buyers: To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure Responsibility: To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 89-1, 1-10-1989)
13-1-3: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Title includes methods and provisions for:
A. Restricting Uses: Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion, or flood heights or
velocities;
B. Protection Of Facilities: Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood at the time of
initial construction;
C. Controlling Alterations: Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, streams, channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or
channel flood waters;
D. Development Control: Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas. (Ord. 89-1, 1-10-1989)

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this title shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 341/359
to give this title its most reasonable application:
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by
high velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and depositions; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial

A. The overflow of inland tidal waters.
B. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have
been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the
extent of depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood
modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system, which consists of a levee or levees and associated structure, such as closure, and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, isnot considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of section 60.3 of the national flood insurance
program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: Means, for purposes of the national flood insurance program, the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
PLANNING COMMISSION1: An official body established by the city council of Clearfield City, which shall administer this title.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
A. Built on a single chassis;
B. Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
C. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (pub. L.97-348),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation
for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction"

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=372 343/359
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimumnecessary conditions, or
B. Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this title when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this title. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Title 14
IMPACT FEES
Chapter 1
IMPACT FEES
14-1-1: FINDINGS AND AUTHORITY:
The city council finds and determines that growth and development activity in the city will create additional demand and need for sanitary sewer, publicly
owned parks, open space and recreational facilities, storm drainage and culinary water facilities in the city; and the city council finds that growth and
development activity should pay a proportionate share of the cost of such planned facilities needed to serve the growth and development activity. The city
council further finds that impact fees are necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in
comparison to the benefits already received and yet to be received. Therefore, pursuant to Utah Code Annotated, title 11, chapter 36a (the "impact fees

in the appendices accurately describe or capture the impacts of a development activity on planned facilities, the impact fee administrator may conduct
independent fee calculations. The impact fee administrator may impose alternative impact fees on a specific development activity based solely on
these calculations. The alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer.
7/15/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

B. Fee Payer; Submission Of Calculation: If a fee payer opts not to have the impact fees determined according to the schedules set forth in the
appendices, then the fee payer shall prepare and submit to the impact fee administrator an independent fee calculation for the development activity for
which final plat, PD, site plan, or other development approval, or a building permit is sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon
which the independent fee calculation was made. The appropriate city staff persons shall review the independent fee calculation and provide an
analysis to the building official concerning whether the independent fee calculation should be accepted, rejected or accepted in part. The building
official may adopt, reject or adopt in part the independent fee calculation based on the analysis prepared by appropriate city staff persons and based
on the specific characteristics of the development activity, and/or principles of fairness. The impact fees or alternative impact fees and the calculations
shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer.
C. Fee For Review By City Staff: Any fee payer submitting an independent fee calculation will be required to pay the city a fee to cover the cost of
reviewing the independent fee calculation. The amount of the fee shall be in accordance with the city's current consolidated fee schedule.
D. Consideration By City: While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in the city capital improvements plan are valid, the building official
shall consider the documentation submitted by the fee payer and the analysis prepared by the appropriate city staff persons, but is not required to
accept such documentation or analysis which the building official reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require
the fee payer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The building official is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case by
case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development activity, and/or principles of fairness. The impact
fees or alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer.

development activity will occur. No appeal shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at issue have been paid.
B. Determinations Appealable: The impact fee administrator's determinations with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development
approval and/or a building permit, the availability of an exemption, the availability or value of a credit, or the building official's decision concerning the
independent fee calculation which is authorized in section 14-1-15 of this chapter, or the impact fees imposed by the impact fee administrator pursuant
to section 14-1-5 of this chapter, or any other determination which the impact fee administrator is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, can be
administratively appealed to the city council pursuant to Utah Code Annotated section 11-36a-703, as amended.
C. Time Limit; Filing; Fee: Administrative appeals shall be taken within thirty (30) days after payment of an impact fee. Appeals shall be taken to the city
council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city recorder, specifying the grounds thereof, and depositing an administrative fee in the amount set

fee. The impact fee administrator shall transmit to the city council and within two (2) weeks of the written request for information, to the person
appealing the fee, all papers constituting the record for the determination, including the written analysis required by title 11, chapter 36a of the Utah
code (the act), as amended, and any other relevant information relating to the impact fee.
D. Conduct Of Hearing: The city council shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal, give notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same. At the
hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. If the matter which is the subject of the appeal requires development approval which
also requires a hearing before the city council, both the appeal and the development approval hearing may be combined in a single hearing.
E. Findings Of Fact: The city council is authorized to make findings of fact regarding the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the
availability or amount of the credit or the accuracy or applicability of an independent fee calculation. The decision of the city council shall be final,
except as provided in subsection J of this section and shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the appeal was filed.
F. Decision: The city council may, so long as such action is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or part, or may
modify the determination of the impact fee administrator with respect to the amount of the impact fees imposed or the credit awarded upon a
determination that is proper to do so based on principles of fairness, and may make such order, requirements, decision or determination as ought to be
made, and to that end shall have the powers which have been granted to the impact fee administrator by this chapter.
G. Reconsideration: Any fee payer who believes that the decision of the city council is based on erroneous procedures, errors of law or fact, error in
judgment, or has discovered new evidence which could not be reasonably available at the prior hearing, may make a written request for
reconsideration by the city council within ten (10) working days of the date the decision is rendered. Such fee payer is the "appellant" for the purpose of
this subsection. This request shall set forth the specific errors or new information relied upon by such appellant, and the city council may, after review of
the record, take further action as it deems proper.
H. Stay Of Appeal: The filing of a request for reconsideration shall effectively stay the appeal period until the city council takes further action.
I. Flaws In Program: Where the city council determines that there is a flaw in the impact fee program or that a specific exemption or credit should be
awarded on a consistent basis or that the principles of fairness require amendments to this chapter, they shall issue a decision requiring that such a
modification, change or elimination of a fee or fee requirement, as is deemed necessary to correct the flaw, be made.
J. District Court Review: Any fee payer aggrieved by a decision of the city council may submit an appeal of the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction
as set forth in title 11, chapter 36a of the Utah code (the act), as amended. (Ord. 2013-07, 5-28-2013, eff. 9-1-2013)

Chapter 2
REIMBURSEMENT FOR IMPROVEMENTS
14-2-1: REIMBURSEMENT FROM PROPERTY OWNERS AND/OR DEVELOPERS FOR IMPROVEMENTS:
A. Improvement Costs: The city shall be entitled to collect from property owners and/or developers of property, prior to the issuance of any permit or
approval, the costs of any improvements for which either the city or another developer has paid for and constructed which would constitute a project
improvement to the property owner's/developer's development activity. The project improvements shall include any improvement which specifically
benefits the development activity by providing improvements which would need to be installed by the property owner/developer prior to development.
The property owner's/developer's reimbursement costs shall be calculated by the city engineer, based upon the city's and/or the other developer's
actual costs for property acquisition, design, construction and installation of the improvements. The city may withhold the issuance of a permit or final
approval until such time as the property owner's/developer's share of the costs previously incurred by the city and/or another developer has been paid.
B. Reimbursement Agreements:
1. The city is authorized to enter into reimbursement agreements with developers for improvements to water, sewer, stormwater, roads, or parks which
extend, expand, or improve the city's water, sewer, stormwater, roads, or parks, beyond what is required to service or benefits the subdivision or
development proposed by the developer. Such reimbursement agreements are not mandatory, but instead may be used at the discretion of the city
council upon advice from the city engineer, public works director, city manager, and city attorney. The amount to be reimbursed to the developer shall
be set forth in the reimbursement agreement as determined by the city engineer, subject to the review and approval of the city council, giving
consideration to the improvements required for and/or benefiting the developer's development as well as those improvements which extend, expand
or improve the city's water, sewer, stormwater, roads, or parks beyond what is required for the development.
2. The city shall, in all cases, be immune and not liable for any payments to the developer if a reimbursement agreement is determined to be
unenforceable. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to pursuant to a reimbursement agreement approved by the city council and fully executed by all
parties thereto, the responsibility for payment of costs incurred by a developer for property acquisition, design, construction and installation of the
required improvements or facilities shall rest entirely with the developer. The city shall have no obligation to reimburse a developer for any amounts
unless and until funds have actually been received by the city from other property owners/developers pursuant to this section. Developers shall only
be eligible to receive reimbursement funds for those costs actually incurred and expended by the developer for property acquisition, design,
construction and installation of the required improvements or facilities which are in excess of the developer's own share of said costs, as determined
by the city.
3. Reimbursement agreements shall not confer a benefit upon any third party and shall be in a form approved by the city attorney. Prior to entering into
a reimbursement agreement with a developer pursuant to this section, the city will first hold a public hearing on the matter after providing ten (10)
days' written notice to property owners upon whose property the reimbursement agreement would subject future development activity to reimbursing
either the city or another developer for improvements previously installed. (Ord. 2014-07, 4-22-2014)

original works of art; community participation in the creation of original works of art; community building through the presence of and identification with
original works of art; and a reduction in the incidence of graffiti and other crime. (Ord. 2018-15, 9-11-2018)
