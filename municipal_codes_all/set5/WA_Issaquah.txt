This chapter constitutes the City’s rules and regulations to carry out and implement the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.020 Public records officers.

The City Clerk shall serve as the public records officer for all City records, except those maintained by the Issaquah Police Department. The Office Supervisor for the Police Department shall serve as the public records officer for all records maintained by the Issaquah Police Department. Contact information for the City Clerk and Office Supervisor for the Police Department will be made available to the public in a manner reasonably calculated to provide notice of to whom members of the public may direct requests, such as posting such contact information at City Hall, the Police Department, or on the City’s Internet website. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.030 Maintenance of records.

A. All substantive and procedural rules of general applicability, including but not limited to ordinances and resolutions of the City Council, minutes of the regular meetings of the City Council, and statements of general policy, and all public contracts, deeds, easements and leases shall be indexed and maintained by the City Clerk.

B. All police records shall be maintained in the Issaquah Police Department. Access to police records shall be in accordance with the policy established by the Police Department, pursuant to laws including but not limited to Chapter 42.56 RCW, Chapter 10.97 RCW (Criminal Records Privacy Act), and Chapter 13.50 RCW (Keeping and Release of Juvenile Records).

C. All other records of the City relating to the specific function or responsibility of a particular department shall be maintained for the use of the department and the general public in the office of the particular department. Such records shall include, but not be limited to: planning policies and goals, and interim and final planning decisions; factual staff reports and studies; factual consultant’s reports and studies; scientific reports and studies; and any other factual information derived from tests, studies, reports or surveys, whether conducted by City employees or others. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.040 Index of public records – Findings.

A. The Public Records Act requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

B. RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that an agency need not maintain such an index if to do so would be unduly burdensome, but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome or would interfere with agency operations.

C. The City is comprised of numerous departments, their divisions and subdivisions, many if not all of which maintain separate databases and/or systems for the indexing of records and information.

D. Because the City has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems, formats and/or databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a current index of all records. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.050 Index of public records – Order.

Based upon the findings set forth in IMC 1.28.040, and pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the City Council orders the following:

A. The City is not required to maintain an all-inclusive index of public records due to the undue burden and near-impossibility of maintaining such an index.

B. The City will make available for inspection and/or copying all public records, including any indexes that are maintained by the City as set forth in IMC 1.28.030, except to the extent that such records are exempt from public disclosure. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.060 Disclosure of public records.

Unless exempt from disclosure under this chapter or other law, public records shall be available for inspection and copying in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.070 Procedure for inspection or copying.

A. All persons desiring to inspect or obtain a copy of any public record must make their request in writing to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall create and avail for public use a standard form by which a requester may specify particular public records and provide the requester’s relevant contact information. Reasonable assistance as may be necessary to help a requestor locate particular records shall be provided either by the City Clerk or by the City department maintaining the records; provided, that the provision of such assistance shall not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the City Clerk, the department, or the assisting employee.

B. Except to the extent required or authorized by law, the City Clerk or other City employee shall not distinguish among persons requesting records. Persons requesting records shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request, except to establish whether the inspection or copying would violate Chapter 42.56 RCW or other statute or ordinance that exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to certain persons. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.080 Processing public records requests – Review of decision.

A. Responses to requests for public records shall be made promptly pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW. Within 5 business days of the date of receipt by the City of a written request for a record, the City Clerk shall:

1. Provide the record; or

2. Acknowledge that the City has received the request and (a) provide a reasonable estimate of the time the City will require to respond to the request, or (b) request clarification; or

3. Deny the public record request in whole or in part.

B. Public records may be made available on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of requested records are assembled or made ready for public inspection or copying. Additional time to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the intent of the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt. If a public records request is unclear, the City Clerk may ask the requestor to clarify what information the requestor is requesting. If the requestor fails to clarify the request, the City need not further respond to or process the request.

C. If the City Clerk determines that the document is exempt in part but can be made available after deletion of exempt portions, the request shall be granted; provided, that such exempt portions shall first be deleted. If the City Clerk determines to deny the request, in whole or in part, a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial shall be provided to the requestor; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the City to disclose portions of a requested document if the entire document is exempt from disclosure.

D. In the event the City Clerk denies inspection of all or any part of a request, the City Clerk may seek review by the City Attorney. The City Clerk will notify the requestor by mail of the decision to grant or deny the request. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.090 Exemptions.

The City adopts by reference the exemptions from public disclosure contained in Chapter 42.56 RCW, including any future amendments thereto or recodification thereof, along with any other exemption or exception to the Public Records Act provided by law, including but not limited to those exemptions set forth in Appendix C to “Public Records Act for Washington Cities and Counties,” Municipal Research and Services Center, Report No. 61, May 2007, as may be amended from time to time, a copy of which shall be maintained in the office of the City Clerk. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.100 Reimbursement for copying costs.

A. No fee shall be charged for the inspection of public records. Any person who requests a copy of any public record from the City shall pay to the City Clerk or designee a copying charge. The copying charges for public records, including but not limited to photocopies, maps, photographs including slides, audio tape recordings, video tape recordings and diskettes shall be included in a fee schedule maintained by the City Clerk. Nothing herein shall be construed to apply to charges for accident reports pursuant to RCW 46.52.085.

B. The City may charge all costs directly incident to shipping such public records, including but not limited to the cost of postage or delivery charges and the cost of any container or envelope pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(7).

C. The City may, at its discretion, require the requestor to deposit a sum in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request. If the records are made available on a partial or installment basis, the City may charge for each part of the request as it is provided. If an installment of a records request is not paid for or reviewed within 20 days after the City provides notice of availability of the installment, the City is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009). 


1.28.110 Model Rules and administrative procedures.

The City may, in its discretion, follow the Public Records Act Model Rules on file at the City Clerk’s Office. The Mayor, upon recommendation of the City Clerk, may issue additional administrative procedures for the implementation of this chapter. (Ord. 2551 § 1, 2009).

2. That the people have the right to expect from their elected representatives the utmost integrity, honesty and fairness in their dealings;

3. That the people shall be assured that the private financial dealings of their public officials, and of candidates for those offices, present no conflict of interest between the public trust and private interest;

4. That our representative form of government is founded on a belief that those entrusted with the offices of government have nothing to fear from full public disclosure of their financial and business holdings, provided those officials deal honestly and fairly with the people;

5. That public confidence in municipal government is essential and must be promoted by all possible means;

6. That public confidence in municipal government can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of the officials in all public transactions and decisions;

7. That small contributions by individual contributors are to be encouraged;

8. That the public’s right to know of the financing of political campaigns far outweighs any right that this matter remain secret and private;

9. That, mindful of the right of individuals to privacy and of the desirability of the efficient administration of government, full access to information concerning the conduct of municipal government must be assured as a fundamental and necessary precondition to the sound governance of a free society; and

10. That, while a candidate’s contributions of his or her own resources cannot be limited under law, candidates for municipal government offices are encouraged to engage in fair play and respect the spirit of our community by not utilizing excessive amounts of self-funding during a campaign.

B. The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political campaigns so as to assure continuing public confidence of fairness of elections, so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In promoting such complete disclosure, however, this section shall be enforced so as to ensure that the information disclosed will not be misused by arbitrary and capricious purposes and to ensure that all persons reporting under this chapter will be protected from harassment and unfounded allegations based on information they have freely disclosed.

C. Further, it is the intent of the Council that this chapter be interpreted and applied consistent with the de minimus maxim, that inadvertent minor violations of this chapter may be corrected and cured without full penalty in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter. (Ord. 2554 § 1, 2009).

In accordance with Chapter 141, Laws of 1923, and Acts amendatory thereof, being Chapter 35.54 RCW, the City establishes and creates a fund for the purpose of guaranteeing, to the extent of such fund, the payment of its bonds and warrants issued to pay for any local improvement ordered in Local Improvement District No. 8, heretofore created, and in any local improvement districts in the City created subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. This fund shall be known and designated as Local Improvement Guaranty Fund. (Ord. 723 § 1, 1959).


3.32.020 Tax levy authority. 

After the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, there shall be levied, from time to time as other taxes are levied, such sums as may be necessary to meet the financial requirements of the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund created by this chapter. Whenever the City shall have paid out of the Guaranty Fund any sum on account of principal and interest on a local improvement bond or warrant guaranteed under the provisions of this chapter, the City, as Trustee for such fund, shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the holder of the bond, interest coupon or warrant so paid; and the proceeds thereof, or of the underlying assessments, shall become a part of the fund. (Ord. 723 § 2, 1959). 


3.32.030 Defaulted interest coupon, bond, or warrant – Payment. 

Whenever any interest coupon, bond, or warrant guaranteed under the provisions of the laws of the State in pursuance of the ordinance codified in this chapter is passed shall be in default, the City Clerk is authorized and directed, upon the presentation and delivery of such defaulted bond, coupon or warrant, to execute, sign and deliver to the person or persons presenting the same, in the order of their presentation, and the Treasurer shall honor and pay, a warrant on the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund in such amount as may be necessary to pay in full any such coupon, bond or warrant with any interest that may be due thereon. Any defaulted coupon, bond, or warrant received by the City Clerk under the provisions of this chapter shall be held for the benefit of the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund. (Ord. 723 § 3, 1959). 


3.32.040 Warrant issuance for accrued liability. 

Warrants drawing interest at a rate not to exceed 6 percent shall be issued, as other warrants are issued by the City, against the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund to meet any liability accruing against it; and at the time of making its annual budget and tax levy, the City shall provide for the levying of a sum sufficient, with the other resources of the fund, to pay warrants so issued during the preceding fiscal year. Such warrants shall at no time exceed 5 percent of the outstanding bond obligations guaranteed by the fund. (Ord. 723 § 4, 1959).


3.32.050 Payment of interest and surplus into fund. 

The City Treasurer is authorized and directed to pay into such Local Improvement Guaranty Fund all interest received from bank deposits of the fund, as well as any surplus remaining in any Local Improvement District Fund guaranteed under the State Laws after the payment of all outstanding bonds or warrants payable primarily out of such Local Improvement District Fund. (Ord. 723 § 5, 1959). 


3.32.060 Liability of City – Remedy. 

Neither the owner nor the holder of any bond, interest coupon, or warrant issued against a Local Improvement Fund after the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall have any claim therefor against the City, except for payment from the special assessments made for the improvement for which the bond or warrant was issued, and except as against the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund created by this chapter; and the City shall not be liable to any holder or owner of such bond, interest coupon, or warrant for any loss to the Guaranty Fund occurring in the lawful operation thereof by the City. The remedy of the holder or owner of a bond or warrant in case of nonpayment shall be confined to the enforcement of the assessment and to the guaranty fund. A copy of RCW 35.45.070, the provisions of which are included in this section, shall be plainly written, printed, or engraved on each bond issued and guaranteed under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 723 § 6, 1959). 


3.32.070 Foreclosure of delinquent assessments.

If, on the first day of January, in any year, two installments of any local improvement assessment are delinquent, or if the final installment thereof has been delinquent for more than one year, the City Attorney is authorized to commence foreclosure proceedings on the delinquent assessment or delinquent installments by an appropriate action on behalf of the City in King County Superior Court. The foreclosure proceeding shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 35.50 RCW, as now exists or as may hereafter be amended. The proceedings shall be commenced on or before November 1st of that year. (Ord. 2826 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2712 § 2, 2014).


3.32.080 Notice to property owner.

In accordance with RCW 35.50.030 as now exists or as may hereafter be amended, the City Finance Director, or other authorized City official, shall send by certified mail to each person whose name appears on the assessment roll and/or County tax rolls as taxpayer or owner of the property charged with any delinquent assessment or installment, at each address listed on said assessment roll and/or County tax roll, a notice at least 30 days before commencement of any action to foreclose a delinquent assessment or installment. The notice shall state the amount due on each separate lot, tract or parcel of land, including foreclosure cost and the date after which the foreclosure proceedings will commence. (Ord. 2712 § 3, 2014).


3.32.090 Acceleration of installments – Attorney’s fees.

Upon failure to pay any installment due, the City Finance Director or other authorized City official may declare the entire assessment, including interest, and penalties, due and payable and the collection thereof may be enforced by foreclosure in accordance with Chapter 35.50 RCW as it now exists or may hereafter be amended.  In case of foreclosure, there shall be added to the costs and expenses such reasonable attorneys’ fees as the court may adjudge to be equitable, and the amount thereof shall be apportioned to each delinquent assessment or installment appearing on that roll. When one or more delinquent installment is paid before the foreclosure proceedings are completed, payment of such costs shall be a prerequisite to the City’s dismissal of such proceedings unless otherwise ordered by the court. (Ord. 2826 § 2, 2018; Ord. 2712 § 4, 2014).


3.32.100 Penalty rate.

Each LID assessment or installment thereon shall be subject at the time of any delinquency to a charge of five percent penalty per annum (calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the number of days delinquent) levied on the total amount of principal and interest due upon that installment.

Within 5 business days of receiving such report, the City Clerk will mail notice that the report has been filed to any person who filed a written protest at or prior to the public hearing on the assessment roll, in accordance with RCW 35.44.080. A copy of the hearing examiner’s report will be available to the public in the office of the City Clerk. 

C. Council’s Consideration of Recommendations. Upon receipt of the hearing examiner’s report of his or her findings and recommendations, the City Council will review the same. As soon as all timely appeals from the findings and recommendations have been decided or the time allowed for filing appeals has expired with no appeals having been filed, the City Council may accept the assessment roll as prepared, or may correct, revise, raise, lower, change or modify the roll or any part thereof, or may set aside the roll and order the assessment to be made de novo, and at the conclusion thereof, confirm the assessment roll by ordinance. If an appeal has been filed from the findings on recommendations of the hearing examiner, it shall be heard and determined and the results thereof incorporated into the assessment roll before it is confirmed.

B. Upon the filing of a notice of appeal, the City Clerk will promptly notify the City Attorney and furnish a copy of the notice to the City Council and the hearing examiner. Within 15 days following the filing of a notice of appeal, the City Council will set a time and place for a hearing on the appeal before the City Council, provided the time shall be as soon as practicable in order to avoid accumulating additional interest on the obligations of the local improvement district. The City Clerk shall promptly mail notice to the appellant of the time and place for the hearing on the appeal. 

C. Review by the City Council on appeal shall be limited to and shall be based solely on the record from the public hearing; provided, however, that the City Council may permit oral or written arguments or comments when confined to the content of the record of the hearing below. No new evidence may be presented. Written arguments will not be considered unless filed with the City Council at least 1 day prior to the hearing on appeal, and the City Council may determine the appeal on the record, with or without written argument.

The City Council will reduce its determination to writing, file the original in the record of the local improvement district, and transmit a copy of the same to the appellant. In accordance with IMC 3.34.010(C), no ordinance confirming an assessment roll may be enacted by the Council until all appeals to the Council are decided.

Section:

3.59.010    Findings and purpose.

3.59.020    Administrative adjustment authorized.

3.59.030    New service fees.


3.59.010 Findings and purpose.

The City Council has established fees, rates, and charges in order to recover all or part of the cost of providing public service. The City Council finds and determines that small regular adjustments in these fees for inflation is preferable to fewer but larger more significant increases over time. The Council also finds that the required Council approval of a fee, rate or charge may delay implementation of a new program or service. Therefore, the Council adopts this chapter authorizing the Mayor to administratively adjust certain fees, rates and charges for inflation and to establish new service fees when both the new service and fee are similar to an existing service and fee. (Ord. 2615 § 2, 2011).


3.59.020 Administrative adjustment authorized.

A. The Mayor may approve adjustments to the following fees, rates, and charges using the Consumer Price Index for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area as measured from July 1st to July 1st: 

	Chapter 3.64 IMC	Application fees for zoning and subdivision actions

	Chapter 3.65 IMC	Public works services

	Chapter 3.65 IMC	Telecommunication uses of public rights-of-way

	Chapter 5.10 IMC	Adult entertainment license

	Chapter 5.14 IMC	Special event/special use permit

	Chapter 13.100 IMC	Water availability determinations

	Chapter 16.04 IMC	Construction administrative codes

	Chapter 16.06 IMC	Fire code permit fees

	Ordinance 2290	Parks and recreation fees

Any administrative adjustment in fees, rates, and charges shall be calculated in July or as soon thereafter as practical.

B. The decision whether or not to administratively adjust some or all of the fees in subsection A of this section for inflation during any given year is at the discretion of the Mayor. Small increases in inflation over multiple prior years may be indexed in a single adjustment provided that the years to be indexed are consecutive and the fees, rates, and charges were not previously indexed. 

C. The adjusted fees, rates, and charges may be rounded to a whole or more convenient amount, provided the rounding does not exceed 1 percent of the individual fee or charge prior to rounding. The maximum administrative adjustment, including rounding, for a single year or for multiple years in a single adjustment shall not exceed 7 percent of the fee, rate, or charge prior to indexing. The fees, rates, and charges shall not be adjusted for inflation should the index remain unchanged.

D. A copy of the adjusted fees, rates, and charges shall be provided to the City Council but the revised fees shall become effective without further Council review or action.

E. The Mayor is authorized to increase some or all of the fees for parks and recreation as established by Ordinance No. 2290 for nonresidents in an amount up to 20 percent; provided, that such differential rate is not prohibited and otherwise furthers the mission of the parks and recreation department. A copy of the nonresidential rates shall be provided to the City Council as provided in subsection D of this section. (Ord. 2725 § 1, 2014; Ord. 2615 § 3, 2011).


3.59.030 New service fees.

The Mayor may approve a fee for a new service when:

A. The new service is similar to an existing service; and

B. The fee for the new service is similar to the fee for the existing service; and

C. The fee for the existing service was initially approved by the City Council. (Ord. 2615 § 4, 2011).

1. As a condition of receiving an exemption under this subsection, the owner shall execute and record in King County’s real property title records a City-drafted lien, covenant, or other contractual provision against the property that provides that the proposed housing unit or development will continue to be used for low, moderate or mid-moderate income affordable housing. In the event that the property does not comply with the affordability requirements of the covenant then the owner shall pay a school impact fee based upon the schedule then in effect. The lien, covenant, or other contractual provision shall run with the land and apply to subsequent owners and assigns in the event that the housing unit(s) are exempted.

2. Any request for an exemption under this subsection shall be made prior to issuance of a building permit. If a building permit is not required for the development, then the exemption request shall be made when the first development permit is applied for. Any request not made when required by this subsection shall be deemed waived.

3. The Issaquah School District shall pay or bear the cost of the impact fees that are not collected pursuant to this exemption.

C. Rebuilding of legally established dwelling unit(s) destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, act of God or other accident or catastrophe, or remodeling of existing legally established dwelling unit(s); provided, that such rebuilding takes place within a period of 1 year after destruction, and so long as no additional dwelling units are created.

D. Condominium projects in which existing dwelling units are converted into condominium ownership and where no new dwelling units are created.

E. Any development activity that is exempt from the payment of an impact fee pursuant to RCW 82.02.100, due to mitigation of the same system improvement under the State Environmental Policy Act.

F. Any development activity for which school impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a condition of plat approval to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve school facilities, unless the condition of the plat approval provides otherwise; provided, that the condition of the plat approval predates the effective date of fee imposition as provided in IMC 3.63.070(C).

G. Any development activity for which school impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a voluntary agreement entered into with the District to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve school facilities, unless the terms of the voluntary agreement provide otherwise; provided, that the agreement predates the effective date of fee imposition as provided in IMC 3.63.070(C).

H. Accessory Units. A development permit for an accessory unit shall not be assessed a school impact fee. (Ord. 2839 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2746 § 6 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 2529 §§ 2, 3, 2008; Ord. 2074 § 4, 1995).


3.63.040 Interlocal agreement between the City and District.

As a condition of the City’s authorization and adoption of a school impact fee ordinance, the City and District shall enter into an interlocal agreement governing the operation of the school impact fee program, and describing the relationship and liabilities of the parties thereunder. (Ord. 2074 § 5, 1995).


3.63.050 Submission of District capital facilities plan and data.

A. On an annual basis, the District shall submit the following materials to the City Council:

1. The District’s capital facilities plan (as defined in IMC 3.63.020 herein) and adopted by the school board;

2. The District’s enrollment projections over the next 6 years, its current enrollment and the District’s enrollment projections and actual enrollment from the previous year;

3. The District’s standard of service;

4. The District’s overall capacity over the next 6 years, which shall take into account the available capacity from school facilities planned by the District but not yet built and be a function of the District’s standard of service as measured by the number of students which can be housed in District facilities;

5. An inventory of the District’s existing facilities.

B. To the extent that the District’s standard of service identifies a deficiency in its existing facilities, the District’s capital facilities plan must identify the sources of funding other than impact fees, for building or acquiring the necessary facilities to serve the existing student population in order to eliminate the deficiencies within a reasonable period of time.

C. Facilities to meet future demand shall be designed to meet the adopted standard of service. If sufficient funding is not projected to be available to fully fund a capital facilities plan which meets the adopted standard of service, the District’s capital facilities plan should document the reason for the funding gap, and identify all sources of funding that the District plans to use to meet the adopted standard of service.

D. The District shall also submit an annual report to the City Council showing the capital improvements which were financed in whole or in part by the impact fees. 

E. In its development of the financing plan component of the capital facilities plan, the District shall plan on a 6-year horizon and shall demonstrate its best efforts by taking the following steps:

1. Establish a 6-year financing plan, and propose the necessary bond issues and levies required by and consistent with that plan and as approved by the school board consistent with RCW 28A.53.020, 84.52.052 and 84.52.056 as amended; and

2. Apply to the state for funding, and comply with the state requirements for eligibility to the best of the District’s ability. (Ord. 2074 § 6, 1995).


3.63.060 Annual council review.

On at least an annual basis, the City Council shall review the information submitted by the District pursuant to IMC 3.63.050(A) herein. The review shall occur in conjunction with any update of the capital facilities plan element of the City’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2074 § 7, 1995).


3.63.070 Impact fee program elements. 

A. The City shall impose impact fees on every development activity in the City for which a fee schedule has been established.

B. Any impact fee imposed shall be reasonably related to the impact caused by the development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of school facilities that are reasonably related to the new development. The impact fee formula shall account in the fee calculation for future revenues the District will receive from the development. 

C. The impact fee shall be based on the capital facilities described in the capital facilities plan developed by the District and approved by the School Board, and adopted by reference as part of the capital facilities element of the City’s comprehensive plan for the purpose of establishing the fee program. (Ord. 2855 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2074 § 8, 1995).


3.63.080 Fee calculations – Application fee.

A. The fee shall be calculated and assessed at building permit issuance, unless otherwise specified on a final plat. The fee shall be based generally on the formula set forth in the adopted Issaquah School District capital facilities plan, but the Issaquah City Council may impose a greater or lesser fee than the formula may otherwise provide in order to ensure that such fees reflect a proportionate share of the cost of school facilities reasonably related to new development in the City.

B. Separate fees shall be calculated for single-family and multifamily types of dwelling units, and separate student generation rates must be determined by the District for each type of dwelling unit. For the purpose of this chapter, mobile homes shall be treated as single-family dwellings and duplexes shall be treated as multifamily dwellings.

C. The fee shall be calculated on the basis of a District-wide service area, using the appropriate factors and data to be supplied by the District, as indicated in the adopted Issaquah School District capital facilities plan. The fee calculations shall also be made on the basis of a District-wide service area to assure maximum utilization of all school facilities in the District used currently or within the last 2 years for instructional purposes. The fee shall be uniform for each single-family type and multifamily type of new development occurring within the boundaries of the City of Issaquah.

D. Applications for a change of use shall receive credit based on the existing use. This credit is calculated by deducting the fee amount of the existing use from the fee of the proposed use.

E. The formula used to calculate the fee shall provide a credit for the anticipated tax contributions that would be made by the development based on historical levels of voter support for bond issues in the District.

F. The formula shall also provide for a credit for school facilities or sites actually provided by a developer which the District finds acceptable.

G. The City may also impose an application fee to cover the reasonable costs of administration of the impact fee program. The application fee shall be assessed and collected on the date a complete application is filed for approval or issuance of a final plat, final short plat, a cluster development, site development permit, residential building permit, mobile home permit, or mobile home park site plan, where the application fee for the lot or unit at issue has not been previously paid. (Ord. 2855 § 2, 2018; Ord. 2523 § 2, 2008; Ord. 2214 § 2, 1998; Ord. 2074 § 9, 1995).


3.63.085 Deferral of single-family residential impact fees.

A. An applicant for a building permit for a single-family detached or attached residence may request a deferral of the full impact fee payment until the date of final inspection or 18 months from the date of building permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of impact fees shall be granted under the conditions set forth in this section.

B. An applicant for deferral must request the deferral at the time of building permit application and must receive the deferral no later than the time of issuance of a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.

C. To receive a deferral, an applicant must:

1. Submit a separate application for deferral for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the applicant wishes to defer payment of the impact fees. Each application must be accompanied by the nonrefundable administrative fee established by the City Council in order to reimburse the City for all costs associated with the deferral.

2. Grant and record a deferred impact fee lien against the property in favor of the City in the amount of the deferred impact fee. The deferred impact fee lien must:

a. Be in a form approved by the City;

b. Be signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed;

c. Include the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property;

d. Be recorded in King County;

e. Be binding on all successors in title after the recordation; and

f. Be junior and subordinate to 1 mortgage for the purpose of construction granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

3. Notice shall be provided within a week of building permit issuance by posting each property using the following notice method: 

a. 4-Foot by 4-Foot Board. The responsibility for posting the sign rests with the project applicant. The sign shall be designed as follows:

i. Size. 4-by-4-foot constructed of wood;

ii. Color. Yellow background, black lettering;

iii. Lettering Style. Helvetica or similar style; signs shall be prepared using templates or attachable letters. Hand-lettered signs are not acceptable;

iv. Content of Sign/Notice. The title shall be in 3-inch capital letters, and the remaining sign contents shall be in 1.5-inch upper and lower case (see Permit Center for diagram). The content must include:

(A) The title “NOTICE OF DEFERRED IMPACT FEES”;

(B) “City of Issaquah”;

(C) “Notice that these fees must be paid to the City by the Applicant before house can be occupied”;

(D) The name, address and telephone number of the applicant;

(E) The name, address and telephone number of the Development Services Department;

(F) Other information as the Director/Manager may determine to be necessary to adequately notify potential home owners of the pending requirement;

v. Location. The sign shall be installed:

(A) Midpoint on the street frontage from which the site is addressed or as otherwise directed by the Director/Manager;

(B) At either a location 10 feet back in from the property line or signs which are structurally attached to an existing building shall be exempt from the setback provision; provided, that no sign is located more than 10 feet back from the property line without approval from the Director/Manager; and

(C) The sign must be easily read from the surrounding vicinity and must not be visually obstructed in any way, including, but not limited to, obstruction by vegetation or any other obstruction;

vi. Installation. The sign must be secured to a 4-inch by 4-inch wood post, long enough to set the post 36 inches below grade and back fill with dirt (see Permit Center for diagram);

vii. Certification of Installation. The project applicant must notify the Permit Center that the sign has been posted to proper specifications by submitting a signed “Notification of Sign Installation” to the Permit Center before deferral of impact fees may occur (obtain such forms from the Permit Center);

viii. Maintenance and Signage Removal. The project applicant shall be required to maintain the sign and surrounding area in good condition until 14 days after the deferred impact fees have been paid to the City. Removal of the sign prior to the deferred impact fees being paid may invalidate or postpone any other decision-making or permit process. The sign must be removed by the project applicant no later than 30 days after the deferred impact fees have been paid to the City, and the post holes must be filled to prevent public injury. 

D. The amount of the impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

E. The City shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. No temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) will be granted on a residence that is part of the deferral program. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the City shall execute a release of the deferred impact fee lien for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or the property owner at the time of the release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at his or her expense.

F. The extinguishing of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation of the applicant or the property owner to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

G. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with the deferral and in accordance with the terms and conditions provided in this section, the City may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

H. Each applicant for a single-family detached or attached residential construction permit, in accordance with his or her contractor registration number or other unique identification number, shall be entitled to annually receive deferrals for the first 20 single-family residential construction building permits. For purposes of this subsection, an “applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant. (Ord. 2771 § 1, 2016).


3.63.090 Maintenance of fees collected.

The impact fee and the application fee shall be collected by the City, and maintained in separate accounts. All school impact fees shall be paid to the District from the school impact fee account monthly. The City shall retain all application fees associated with the City’s administration of the impact fee program. (Ord. 2214 § 3, 1998; Ord. 2074 § 10, 1995).


3.63.100 Assessment and collection of impact fees.

A. Impact fees shall be imposed upon development activity in the City as follows:

1. $14,501 per single-family residential unit;

2. $9,583 per multifamily residential unit.

These fees may be collected by the City from any applicant where such development activity requires final plat, PUD approval, issuance of a residential building permit or a mobile home permit, and the fee for the lot or unit has not previously been paid.

B. For a plat applied for on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, 50 percent of the impact fees due on the plat shall be assessed at the time of final approval and collected from the applicant prior to the recording of the final plat, using the impact fee schedule in effect at the time of final plat approval. The balance of the assessed fee shall be allocated to the dwelling units in the project, and shall be collected when the building permits are issued, based on the fee schedule in effect at the time of building permit issuance. Residential developments proposed for short plats shall not be governed by this subsection, but shall be governed by subsection D of this section.

C. If on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter a plat has already received preliminary approval, such plat shall not be required to pay 50 percent of the impact fees at the time of final approval, but the impact fees shall be assessed and collected from the lot owner at the time the residential building permits are issued, using the impact fee schedules then in effect at the time of building permit issuance. If on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter an applicant has applied for preliminary plat approval, but has not yet received such approval, the applicant shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection B of this section.

D. For existing lots or lots not covered by subsection B of this section, for application for single-family and multifamily residential building permits, a site development permit, a cluster development permit or a short plat approval, the total amount of the impact fees shall be assessed and collected from the applicant when the building permit is issued, using the impact fee schedules in effect at the time of building permit issuance.

E. The City shall not grant final plat approval nor issue the required residential building permit unless and until the impact fees set forth in the impact fee schedule have been paid.

F. Any application for preliminary plat approval or multifamily development which has been approved subject to conditions requiring the payment of impact fees established pursuant to this chapter shall be required to pay the fee in accordance with the conditions of approval. (Ord. 2876 § 1, 2019; Ord. 2856 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2822 § 1, 2017; Ord. 2776 § 1, 2016; Ord. 2743 § 1, 2015; Ord. 2718 § 1, 2014; Ord. 2693 § 1, 2013; Ord. 2659 § 1, 2012; Ord. 2623 § 1, 2011; Ord. 2597 § 1, 2010; Ord. 2564 § 1, 2009; Ord. 2553 § 4 (Exh. B3), 2009; Ord. 2529 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2523 § 2, 2008; Ord. 2509 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2467 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2451 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2400 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2376 § 1, 2003; Ord. 2351 § 1, 2002; Ord. 2302 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2237 § 1, 1999; Ord. 2214 § 4, 1998; Ord. 2191 § 1, 1998; Ord. 2163 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2143 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2074 § 11, 1995).


3.63.110 Determination of the fee, adjustments, exceptions and appeals.

A. The City shall determine a developer’s impact fee, based upon the fee schedule adopted in IMC 3.63.100(A). 

B. The fee amount established in the schedule shall be reduced by the amount of any payment previously made for the lot or development activity in question, either as a condition of approval or pursuant to a voluntary agreement.

C. Whenever a developer is granted approval subject to a condition that the developer actually provide a school facility acceptable to the District, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for the actual cost of providing the facility, against the fee that would be chargeable under the formula provided by this chapter. The cost of construction shall be estimated at the time of approval, but must be documented, and the documentation confirmed after the construction is completed to assure that an accurate credit amount is provided. If construction costs are less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as a school impact fee.

D. The standard impact fees may be adjusted, if one of the following circumstances exists; provided, that any discount used in the fee formula fails to adjust for the error in the calculation or fails to ameliorate for the unfairness of the fee:

1. The developer demonstrates that an impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or

2. Unusual circumstances identified by the developer demonstrate that if the standard impact fee amount was applied to the development, it would be unfair or unjust.

E. In cases where a developer requests an independent fee calculation, adjustment exception or a credit pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(3), the City shall consult with the District and the District shall advise the City prior to the City making the final impact fee determination.

F. A developer may provide studies and data to demonstrate that any particular factor used by the District may not be appropriately applied to the development proposal. 

G. Any appeal of the decision of the City with regard to fee amounts shall follow the process for the appeal of the underlying development application, as set forth in the Issaquah Municipal Code. Any errors in the formula identified as a result of the appeal should be referred to the Council for possible modification. 

H. Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a permit or other approval of development activity. (Ord. 2855 § 3, 2018; Ord. 2771 § 2, 2016; Ord. 2074 § 12, 1995).


3.63.120 Impact fee accounts and refunds.

A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the District solely for the District’s school impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the District, based in part on its report prepared pursuant to IMC 3.63.050, shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. The District shall submit a copy of this report to the City Council. The City shall maintain separate school impact fee and administration fee accounts pursuant to IMC 3.63.090, and shall prepare a report on the source and amount of all school impact fees collected and transferred to the District.

B. Impact fees for the District’s system improvements shall be expended by the District only in conformance with the capital facilities plan element of the comprehensive plan. 

C. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the District for a permissible use within 6 years of receipt by the District, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 6 years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified to the City by the District in a written report.   The City Council shall identify the District’s extraordinary and compelling reasons for the fees to be held longer than 6 years in the Council’s own written findings.

D. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within 6 years of receipt of the funds by the District on school facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The District shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States postal service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the County tax records.

E. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the District in writing within 1 year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the District in conformance with the capital facilities plan within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this 1-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.

F. Should the City seek to terminate any or all school impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a school impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least 2 times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the County tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of 1 year. At the end of 1 year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the District, but must be expended by the District, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated. 

G. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:

1. The developer does not proceed to finalize the development activity as required by statute or City Code including the Uniform Building Code; and

2. No impact on the District has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the District has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the District has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of 3 years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the District and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The District shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in IMC 3.63.110.

H. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the District on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 2074 § 13, 1995).

Sections: 

3.70.010    Small works roster procedures.

3.70.020    Limited small works roster procedures.


3.70.010 Small works roster procedures.

A. Cost. The City need not comply with formal sealed bidding procedures for the construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property where the estimated cost is within the limits, as set forth in RCW 35.23.352 for single-craft or multiple-crafts or within the limits as set forth by RCW 39.04.155, for the use of the small works roster. The estimated cost must include the costs of labor, material, equipment and sales and/or use taxes as applicable. The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the small works roster process.

B. Number of Rosters. The City may create a single general small works roster, or may create a small works roster for different categories of anticipated work. Said small works rosters may make distinctions between contractors based upon different geographic areas served by the contractor.

C. Contractors on Small Works Roster(s). The small works roster(s) shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the roster(s), and are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state.

D. Publication. At least once a year, the City shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the City a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit the names of contractors for such roster or rosters. Responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time that they submit a written request and necessary records. The City may require master contracts be signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster. An interlocal contract or agreement between the City and other local governments establishing a small works roster or rosters to be used by the parties to the agreement or contract must clearly identify the lead entity that is responsible for implementing the small works roster provisions.

E. Electronic, Telephone or Written Quotations. The City shall obtain electronic, telephone, or written quotations for public works contracts from contractors on the appropriate small works roster to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, as defined in RCW 43.19.1911, as follows:

1. A contract awarded from a small works roster need not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitations. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes;

2. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster. As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least 5 contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that attempts to equitably distribute opportunities among the contractors on the appropriate roster;

3. If the estimated cost of the work is above $65,000 for multi-craft or $40,000 for single-craft projects up to the limits of use of small works roster as set forth in RCW 39.04.155, the City may choose to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster but must also notify the remaining contractors on the appropriate small works roster that quotations on the work are being sought. The City has the sole option of determining whether this notice to the remaining contractors is made by:

a. Publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the area where the work is to be done;

b. Mailing a notice to these contractors; or

c. Sending a notice to these contractors by facsimile or other electronic means;

4. For purposes of this section, “equitably distribute” means that the City may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services. At the time bids are solicited, the City representative shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor’s bid for the same project;

5. A written record shall be made by the City representative of each contractor’s bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone inquiry; and

6. At least once every year a list of contracts awarded under this section shall be furnished to the City Council and the Mayor, and shall be made available to the general public. The list shall contain the name of the contractor or vendor awarded the contract, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed or items purchased under the contract, and the date it was awarded. The list shall also state the location where the bid quotations for these contracts are available for public inspection. 

F. Determining Lowest Responsible Bidder. To the extent consistent with applicable commitment authority, the Mayor shall award the contract for the public works project to the lowest responsible bidder; as provided in RCW 39.04.350 and the bid documents. All bids may be rejected and the City may call for new bids. 

G. Life Cycle Costing. In considering bids for the construction of public works projects, whenever there is reason to believe that applying the “life cycle costing” method to bid evaluation would result in the lowest total cost to the City, first consideration shall be given to the bid with the lowest life cycle cost which complies with the specifications. “Life cycle cost” means the total cost of an item to the City over its estimated useful life, including costs of selection, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and, where applicable, disposal, as far as these costs can reasonably be determined, minus the salvage value at the end of its estimated useful life. The “estimated useful life” of an item means the estimated time from the date of acquisition to the date of replacement or disposal, determined in any reasonable manner.

H. Award. All of the telephone bids or quotations shall be collected and presented at the same time to the City for consideration, determination of the lowest responsible bidder and award of the contract. (Ord. 2582 §§ 1 – 4, 2010; Ord. 2422 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2342 § 1, 2002).


3.70.020 Limited small works roster procedures.

A. Cost. In lieu of awarding public works contracts under IMC 3.70.010, the City may award a contract for work, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property where the estimated cost does not exceed $35,000, which includes the costs of labor, material, equipment and sales and/or use taxes as applicable, using the limited small works roster procedures of this section. Public works contracts awarded under this section are exempt from the other requirements of the small works roster process outlined in IMC 3.70.010(E). The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the limited small works roster process established herein.

B. Electronic or Written Quotations. The City shall solicit electronic or written quotations from contractors on the appropriate small works roster established under IMC 3.70.010 and shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder, as defined in RCW 43.19.1911. The following procedures shall be utilized:

1. A contract awarded using the limited small works roster process need not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes;

2. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster. As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least 3 contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that attempts to equitably distribute the opportunities among the contractors on the appropriate roster; 

3. For purposes of these procedures, “equitably distribute” means that the City may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services. At the time bids are solicited, the City representative shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor’s bid for the same project;

4. A written record shall be made by the City representative of each contractor’s bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by electronic request; and

5. The City shall maintain a list of the contractors contacted and the contracts awarded under the limited small works roster process for a period of 24 months. The list shall contain the name of the contractor, the contractor’s registration number, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed, and the date the contract was awarded. 

C. Bonds and Retainage. For limited public works roster projects, the City may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of Chapter 39.08 RCW and the retainage bond requirements of Chapter 60.28 RCW, and thereby assume full responsibility and liability for the contractor’s nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialmen, suppliers, and taxes imposed under RCW Title 82 that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project; provided, however, that such a waiver by the City shall not constitute a waiver of the City’s right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor’s behalf by the City.

D. Determining Lowest Responsible Bidder – Award. The City shall determine the lowest responsible bidder and award the contract as provided in IMC 3.70.010. (Ord. 2582 § 5, 2010; Ord. 2422 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2342 § 1, 2002).

3.71.040 Exemptions.

A. The following are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

1. Low, moderate and mid-moderate income affordable housing; provided, that the applicant shall record a City-drafted covenant that prohibits using the affordable housing units for any purpose other than for low, moderate or mid-moderate income affordable housing. At a minimum, the covenant must address price restrictions and household income limits for the low, moderate or mid-moderate income affordable housing, and that if the affordable units are converted to a use other than for low, moderate or mid-moderate income affordable housing, the property owner must pay the applicable impact fees in effect at the time of conversion. Covenants must be recorded with the applicable County Auditor or recording officer. The covenant shall run with the land and apply to subsequent owners and assigns of housing units that receive a low, moderate, or mid-moderate income affordable housing exemption from impact fees. Any claim or request for an exemption under this section shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. If a building permit is not required for the development, then the claim shall be made when the first development permit is applied for. Any claim not made when required by this section shall be deemed waived.

2. Buildings or structures constructed by a regional transit authority, pursuant to RCW 82.02.090(1).

3. City Projects. An applicant proposing the development of a City project shall not be assessed a traffic impact fee.

4. The reconstruction of a building destroyed by fire, explosion or other accident when the building size and type after reconstruction are equal to or less than the development before the accident.

5. Accessory Units. A development permit for an accessory unit shall not be assessed a traffic impact fee.

B. A change of use to an existing building is not a measurable impact to public facilities and is therefore not subject to impact fees; provided, that the change of use occurs within 1 year of the prior use. The expansion of a building or a change of use after more than 1 year is subject to this chapter. (Ord. 2839 § 3, 2018; Ord. 2746 § 6 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 2733 § 1 (Exh. E), 2015; Ord. 2461 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2405 § 17, 2004; Ord. 2145 § 5, 1997. Formerly 18.15.040).


3.71.050 Traffic impact fee program elements.

A. The City shall mitigate the impacts of new developments on the City’s traffic system by imposing traffic impact fees on every development permit, except as provided in IMC 3.71.040, Exemptions.

B. Any impact fee imposed shall be reasonably related to the impact created by the development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements that are reasonably related to the new development.

C. The impact fee imposed may include costs for system improvements previously incurred by the City to the extent that new development will be served by the previously constructed improvements; provided, that such fee shall not be imposed to correct any system improvement deficiencies.

D. The impact fee imposed shall be determined and calculated using the methods established in the Traffic Rate Study.

E. The impact fee calculation shall include a credit for the fair market value of any dedication of land or improvements to land which are listed in the Traffic Rate Study and which are not primarily for the purpose of access to the development or necessary for circulation within the site. The fair market value of the dedication shall be measured at the time of the dedication to the City. (Ord. 2733 § 1 (Exh. E), 2015; Ord. 2569 § 2 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 2473 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2461 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2290 § 4, 2000; Ord. 2258 §§ 2, 3, 1999; Ord. 2145 § 6, 1997. Formerly 18.15.050).


3.71.060 Traffic impact fee technical methods.

A. The Traffic Rate Study and other data and information necessary to calculate the impact fee shall be available to the public. Data such as traffic counts, road capacities, and system improvement projects and costs, and resulting fee schedules, will be updated as necessary. Forms and procedures will be established administratively.

B. The Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, latest edition, or other information where appropriate, shall be used to determine the gross trip generation rate per unit of land use for a proposed development.

C. The gross trip generation rate shall be reduced by a factor that eliminates “pass-by trips” for land uses where such pass-by trips occur, since such trips generate no new vehicle trips on City streets.

D. The final impact fee per unit of land use shall be the number of net new trips generated by the proposed use multiplied by the unit of measure for the use multiplied by the impact fee per unit of measure.

E. The impact fee rates shall be based only on capacity improvements necessary to serve anticipated growth and not those that remove existing capacity deficiencies. In the event that a single capacity improvement project includes elements which serve both existing deficiencies and the needs of growth, the proportion of capacity and cost attributable to existing deficiencies shall not be counted. (Ord. 2733 § 1 (Exh. E), 2015; Ord. 2642 § 1, 2012; Ord. 2607 § 1, 2011; Ord. 2580 § 1, 2010; Ord. 2548 § 4, 2009; Ord. 2473 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2461 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2145 § 7, 1997. Formerly 18.15.060).

3.71.061 Impact rates.

A. The impact fee rates listed in the tables in Section IV.C of the 2019 City of Issaquah Transportation Impact Fee and Pedestrian and Bicycle Mitigation Fee Update (“the Rate Study”) attached as Exhibit A to Ordinance No. 2877 are based on the methods outlined in IMC 3.71.050 and 3.71.060 and shall be applied to the uses listed in said tables.

B. The impact fee for any use not listed in the table in Section IV.C of the Rate Study shall be determined by the Director using:

1. The impact fee rate for the use listed most similar to the use not listed; or

2. The trip generation rate for the proposed use from the latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers and the methodology outlined in the Rate Study and IMC 3.71.050 and 3.71.060 to calculate the impact fee; or

3. Studies and data provided by the applicant and the methodology outlined in the Rate Study and IMC 3.71.050 and 3.71.060 to calculate the impact fee;

4. The applied impact fee rate may be adjusted in accordance with IMC 3.71.080.

C. The traffic impact fee rates shall be updated annually using the following procedures:

1. The Director shall use the construction cost index published by the Engineering News Record to calculate annual inflation adjustments in the impact fee rates. The traffic impact fees shall not be adjusted for inflation should the construction cost index remain unchanged or decrease in value.

2. The indexed impact fee rates shall be calculated in January, or as soon thereafter as the latest construction cost index information is published by Engineering News Record, and shall become effective immediately thereafter. A copy of the indexed impact fee rates shall be provided to the City Council but the indexed rates shall become effective without further Council review.

D. The Administration shall review the traffic impact fee rates annually to determine when a new traffic impact fee study should be prepared and recommend to the City Council when a new study should be prepared; provided, that the traffic impact fee study shall be updated, generally, at least every 3 years.

viii. Maintenance and Signage Removal. The project applicant shall be required to maintain the sign and surrounding area in good condition until 14 days after the deferred impact fees have been paid to the City. Removal of the sign prior to the deferred impact fees being paid may invalidate or postpone any other decision-making or permit process. The sign must be removed by the project applicant no later than 30 days after the deferred impact fees have been paid to the City, and the post holes must be filled to prevent public injury. 

D. The amount of the impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

E. The City shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. No temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) will be granted on a residence that is part of the deferral program. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the City shall execute a release of the deferred impact fee lien for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or the property owner at the time of the release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at his or her expense.

F. The extinguishing of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation of the applicant or the property owner to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

3.71.090 Impact fee accounts and refunds.

A. Impact fees shall be retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the City solely for traffic impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which traffic impact fees were imposed. Annually, the City shall prepare a report on the source and amount of all traffic impact fees collected, interest earned, and traffic improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.

B. Impact fees for the City’s traffic facilities improvements shall be expended by the City only in conformance with the projects listed in the Traffic Rate Study based on the Capital Facilities Element of the Comprehensive Plan.

C. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the City for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the City, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified in writing by the City.

D. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered by the City for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt of the funds. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis.

E. The City shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States postal service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the County tax records if an impact fee is not expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt.

F. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the City in writing within 1 year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given by the City, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the City in conformance with the Capital Facilities Element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this 1-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.

G. Should the City seek to terminate any or all traffic impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a traffic impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least 2 times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the County tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of 1 year.

Forms and procedures will be established administratively. (Ord. 2523 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2461 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2229 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.16.060).


3.73.070 Fee collection.

A. At the time of issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be calculated based on the fee schedule established in the table set forth as Exhibit III-6 in the 2019 City of Issaquah Fire Impact Fee and General Government Buildings and Law Enforcement Mitigation Fee Update (the “Rate Study”) attached to Ordinance No. 2877. Except as provided in IMC 3.73.075, no building permit shall be issued until the impact fee has been paid in full by the applicant; provided, that payment of fees may be phased if the building permit for the development is also phased. The fire protection impact fee shall be collected by the City, and maintained in a separate account, as required by IMC 3.73.090. Fire protection impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a building permit, or other development approval.

B. Fire impact fee rates shall be updated annually using the following procedures:

1. The Director shall use the Building Cost Index published by Engineering News Record to calculate annual inflation adjustments in the impact fee rates. The impact fees shall not be adjusted for inflation should the index remain unchanged. 

2. The indexed impact fee rates shall be calculated in January, or as soon thereafter as the latest index information is published by Engineering News Record, and shall become effective immediately thereafter. A copy of the indexed impact fee rates shall be provided to the City Council but the indexed rates shall become effective without further Council review.

3. The administration shall review the fire impact fee rates annually to determine when a new fire impact fee rate study should be prepared and recommend to the City Council when a new study should be prepared; provided, that the fire impact fee study shall be updated at least every 3 years. (Ord. 2877 § 3, 2019; Ord. 2771 § 7, 2016; Ord. 2523 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2461 §§ 3, 8, 2006; Ord. 2283 § 5, 2000; Ord. 2229 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.16.070).

viii. Maintenance and Signage Removal. The project applicant shall be required to maintain the sign and surrounding area in good condition until 14 days after the deferred impact fees have been paid to the City. Removal of the sign prior to the deferred impact fees being paid may invalidate or postpone any other decision-making or permit process. The sign must be removed by the project applicant no later than 30 days after the deferred impact fees have been paid to the City, and the post holes must be filled to prevent public injury. 

D. The amount of the impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

E. The City shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. No temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) will be granted on a residence that is part of the deferral program. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the City shall execute a release of the deferred impact fee lien for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or the property owner at the time of the release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at his or her expense.

1. The applicant demonstrates that a fire protection impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or 

2. The applicant provides studies and data that, when considered, suggest that adjustment of the fee would be appropriate; provided, that the study is supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions in such study, the study is prepared using generally accepted methods of planning, engineering and financial analysis and the study is performed by a person with qualifications and experience in the costs, benefits and financing of public facilities; or 

3. Unusual circumstances exist which, when considered, suggest that imposition of the standard fee would be unfair.

B. The Director shall consider the documentation submitted by the applicant, but is not required to accept such documentation which the Director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable.

C. Any appeal of the decision of the City with regard to fire protection impact fee amounts shall follow the process for the appeal of the underlying development permit, as set forth in the Issaquah Land Use Code, and IMC 3.73.120. (Ord. 2461 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2229 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.16.080).


3.73.090 Fire protection impact fee accounts and refunds.

A. Fire protection impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest bearing account established by the City solely for fire protection impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which said fees were imposed. Annually, the City shall prepare a report on the source and amount of all fire protection impact fees collected, interest earned, and the fire protection facilities that were financed in whole or in part by said fees. 

B. Fire protection impact fees shall be expended by the City only in conformance with the Capital Facilities Element of the Comprehensive Plan.

C. Fire protection impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the City for a permissible use within 6 years of receipt by the City, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 6 years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified in written findings by the City. 

D. The current owner of property on which a fire protection impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the City fails to expend or encumber the fees within 6 years of receipt of the fees by the City on fire protection facilities intended to benefit the development for which said fees were paid. In determining whether fire protection impact fees have been encumbered, such fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The City shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of the claimants. 

E. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the City in writing within 1 year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any fire protection impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the City in conformance with the Capital Facilities Element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this 1 year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of fire protection impact fees shall include interest earned on such fees.

F. Should the City seek to terminate any or all fire protection impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least 2 times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail to the last known address of claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of 1 year. At the end of 1 year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the City, and must be expended by the City consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The notice requirements set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

G. An applicant may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the fire protection impact fees, when:

1. The applicant does not proceed to finalize the development; and 

2. No impact on the City has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the City has expended or encumbered the fire protection impact fees in good faith prior to the application for refund. In the event that the City has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, within a period of 3 years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the City and provide receipts of fire protection impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The City shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in IMC 3.73.120.

H. Interest due upon the refund of fire protection impact fees required by this chapter shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the City on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 2461 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2229 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.16.090).


3.73.100 Processing.

The City shall determine any applicable fire protection impact fees as a normal part of processing a development permit. (Ord. 2461 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2229 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.16.100).


3.73.110 Other authority.

Chapter 3.74 METHODS TO MITIGATE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS

Sections:

3.74.010    Purpose.

3.74.020    Definition of development.

3.74.030    Determination of direct impact.

3.74.040    Costs.

3.74.050    Mitigation of direct impacts.

3.74.060    Methods of mitigation.

3.74.070    Appeals.


3.74.010 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to provide alternatives for prospective developers of land within the City to mitigate the direct impacts that have been specifically identified by the City as a consequence of proposed development, and to make provisions for, including but not limited to, police, general governmental buildings and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be considered in conjunction with the provisions of Chapters 3.71, 3.72 and 3.73 IMC. No development shall be required to provide duplicate mitigation for the same impacts. (Ord. 2733 § 3 (Exh. G), 2015; Ord. 2461 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2230 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.18.010).


3.74.020 Definition of development.

For purposes of this chapter, the term “development” shall include, but not be limited to, subdivisions, short subdivisions, binding site plans, building permits and any other development permits defined by the Land Use Code. (Ord. 2733 § 3 (Exh. G), 2015; Ord. 2461 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2230 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.18.020).


3.74.030 Determination of direct impact.

Before any development is given the required approval or is permitted to proceed, the official or body charged with deciding whether such approval should be given shall determine direct impacts, if any, that are a direct consequence of the proposed development and which require mitigation, considering, but not limited to, the following factors:

A. Predevelopment versus postdevelopment need for services such as City streets, sewers, water supplies, drainage facilities, parks, playgrounds, recreational facilities, schools, police services, fire services, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and other municipal facilities or services;

B. Likelihood that a direct impact of a proposed development would require mitigation due to the cumulative effect of such impact when aggregated with the similar impacts of future development in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development;

C. Size, number, condition and proximity of existing facilities to be affected by the proposed development;

D. Nature and quantity of capital improvements reasonably necessary to mitigate specific direct impacts identified as a consequence of the proposed development;

E. Likelihood that the users of the proposed development will benefit from any mitigating capital improvements or programs; and

F. Any significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed development identified in the process of complying with the Environmental Policy Ordinance (Chapter 18.10 IMC) or the State Environmental Policy Act. (Ord. 2733 § 3 (Exh. G), 2015; Ord. 2461 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2230 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.18.030).


3.74.040 Costs.

The cost of any investigations, analysis or reports necessary for a determination of direct impact shall be borne by the applicant. (Ord. 2733 § 3 (Exh. G), 2015; Ord. 2461 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2230 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.18.040).


3.74.050 Mitigation of direct impacts.

The official or body charged with granting the necessary approval for a proposed development shall review an applicant’s proposal for mitigating any identified direct impacts and determine whether such proposal is a reasonable and acceptable mitigation measure considering the cost and land requirements of the required improvement and the extent to which the necessity for the improvement is attributable to the direct impacts of the proposed development. No official or body shall approve a development unless reasonable provisions have been made to mitigate identified direct impacts that are direct consequences of such development. (Ord. 2733 § 3 (Exh. G), 2015; Ord. 2461 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2230 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.18.050).


3.74.060 Methods of mitigation.

A. The methods of mitigating identified direct impacts required as a condition of any development approval may include, but are not limited to, dedication of land to any public body, off-site improvement, on-site improvements, and other capital or noncapital methods that may effectively reduce direct impacts.

B. In lieu of a dedication of land or to mitigate a direct impact that has been identified as a consequence of a proposed development, the City may approve a voluntary payment agreement with the developer, which shall be subject to the following provisions:

1. The official or body approving development must find that the money offered will mitigate or is a satisfactory alternative to mitigate the identified direct impact.

a. Police mitigation shall be assessed using the rate study for law enforcement facilities, as referenced in IMC 18.10.260, SEPA – Policies.

b. General government buildings mitigation shall be assessed based on the rate study for general government buildings, as referenced in IMC 18.10.260, SEPA – Policies.

c. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation shall be assessed based on the Nexus Study for Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities, as referenced in IMC 18.10.260, SEPA – Policies.

d. Police, general governmental buildings and bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation calculations shall be updated annually, using the following procedures:

i. The Director shall use the National Construction Cost Index to calculate annual inflation adjustments in the mitigation fee rates. The mitigation fees shall not be adjusted for inflation should the index remain unchanged.

ii. The indexed mitigation fee rates shall be calculated in January, or as soon thereafter as the latest index information is published by National Construction Cost Index, and shall become effective immediately thereafter. A copy of the indexed mitigation fee rates shall be provided to the City Council but the indexed rates shall become effective without further Council review.

e. The administration shall review the police, general governmental buildings and bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation fee rates annually to determine when new police, general governmental buildings and bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation fee rate studies should be prepared; provided, that the police, general governmental buildings, bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation fee study shall be updated at least every 3 years.

f. Police, general governmental buildings and bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation rates calculated by the City may be adjusted by the Director, if 1 of the following circumstances exist:

i. The applicant demonstrates that an impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or

ii. Studies and data provided by the applicant demonstrate that 1 or more of the factors used to calculate the impact fee may not be appropriate for the particular use.

2. The payment shall be held in a reserve account and may only be expended to fund a capital improvement or program agreed upon by the parties to mitigate the identified direct impact.

3. No building permit shall be issued until the voluntary payment has been paid in full by the applicant; provided, that payment of fees may be phased if the building permit for the development is also phased.

4. The payment shall be expended in all cases within 5 years of collection, unless otherwise agreed to by the developer.

5. Any payment not expended within 5 years of collection shall be refunded to the property owners of record at the time of the refund with interest at the rate earned in the City’s reserve accounts applicable at the time of refund. If the payment is not expended within the 5 years due to delay attributable to the developer, the payment shall be refunded without interest.

6. Property owners entitled to a refund and/or interest under the provisions of this chapter may voluntarily and in writing waive their right to a refund for specified time in the interest of providing the designated capital improvement or other capital improvement or program identified by the property owner, and acceptable to the City.

7. The developer may voluntarily and in writing waive on behalf of the developer and subsequent purchasers the right to interest and/or a refund in order to facilitate completion of an improvement. Under no condition shall such a waiver be required as a condition of approval. Such waiver shall be recorded with the County where the property is situated and shall be binding on subsequent owners.

C. The developer or applicant may choose to pay a fee in lieu of reservation of all or portions of open space areas required. If the applicant offers to pay money in lieu of open space and if the City accepts the offer, the amount shall be determined based upon the square footage of open space which otherwise would have been required to be provided times the then current market value per square foot of similarly situated property. (Ord. 2877 § 5, 2019; Ord. 2733 § 3 (Exh. G), 2015; Ord. 2624 § 6 (Exh. A5e), 2011; Ord. 2523 § 5, 2008; Ord. 2461 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2283 § 5, 2000; Ord. 2230 § 1, 1999. Formerly 18.18.060).

5.04.040 Definitions.

In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular. 

“Business” includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly.

“Business and occupation tax” or “gross receipts tax” means a tax imposed on or measured by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the business. 

“Commercial or industrial use” means the following uses of products, including byproducts, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:

1. Any use as a consumer; and

2. The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.

“Delivery” means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer’s representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer’s representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. “Dominion and control” means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer’s own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer’s representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property, and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer’s representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer’s representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (RCW Title 62A) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.

“Digital automated service,” “digital code,” and “digital goods” have the same meanings as in RCW 82.04.192.

“Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(b).

“Director” means the Finance Director of the City or any officer, agent or employee of the City designated to act on the Director’s behalf.

“Eligible gross receipts tax” means a tax which:

1. Is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within IMC 5.04.050; and 

2. Is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts and is not an income tax or value added tax; and

3. Is not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales price; and 

4. Is not a sales or use tax, business license fee, franchise fee, royalty or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege; and

5. Is a tax imposed by a local jurisdiction, whether within or without the State of Washington, and not by a country, state, province, or any other nonlocal jurisdiction above the county level.

The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection 1 of this definition.

The City expressly intends that engaging in business include any activity sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the tax under the law and the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Washington.

1. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax, with respect to a sale of goods or services, to a jurisdiction in which the goods are delivered or the services are provided may deduct an amount equal to the gross receipts used to measure that tax from the measure of the tax owed to the City.

2. Notwithstanding the above, a person that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax in more than 1 jurisdiction on the gross income derived from intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall assign those gross receipts to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located).

3. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with another city may deduct an amount equal to the contract price used to measure the tax due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the City.

5.04.092 Allocation and apportionment of income when activities take place in more than 1 jurisdiction.

Effective January 1, 2008, gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of Chapter 82.14A RCW, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:

A. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under IMC 5.04.050(A)(7) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.

B. In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.

C. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

1. The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;

2. If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;

3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;

4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and

5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.

D. If none of the methods in subsection C of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, then the City and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the City to use an alternative method under this subsection. The City may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the City are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.

E. For purposes of subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, “receive” has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.

F. Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other activities taxed under IMC 5.04.050(A)(7) shall be apportioned to the City by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service-income factor and the denominator of which is 2.

1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the City during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the City if: 

a. The individual is primarily assigned within the City;

b. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs 50 percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the City; or

c. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of his or her service in any city and the employee resides in the City.

2. The service-income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service-income of the taxpayer in the City during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service-income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service-income is in the City if the customer location is in the City.

3. Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service-income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the City, and the gross income is attributable under subsection (F)(2) of this section to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (F)(3), “not taxable” means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.

4. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the City, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrators may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:

a. Separate accounting;

b. The exclusion of any 1 or more of the factors;

c. The inclusion of 1 or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the City; or

d. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

5. The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (F)(4) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

a. That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the City; and

b. That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable.

The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

6. If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F.

7. A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.

A. Other than any annual license fee or registration fee assessed under this chapter, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in quarterly installments. At the Director’s discretion, businesses may be assigned to a monthly or annual or other reporting period depending on the tax amount owing or type of tax; provided, however, that businesses with taxable income equal to or less than $20,000 and increasing to $100,000 effective January 1, 2015, per calendar year may file their B&O tax returns on an annual reporting basis. Until December 31, 2020, tax payments are due on or before the last day of the next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered by the return.

The last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or City or federal legal holiday, in which case the last day of such period shall be the next succeeding day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or City or federal legal holiday.

G. If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make a return as and when required in this chapter, the Director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the Director’s estimate of the tax or fees due. Such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the City by the taxpayer. The Director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 2880 § 4, 2019; Ord. 2724 §§ 3, 4, 2014; Ord. 2674 § 1, 2013; Ord. 2654 § 1, 2012; Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).

A. Taxes shall be paid to the Director in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the Director. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the Director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

B. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the City by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the post office upon the envelope containing it. The Director may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the City electronically shall be deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the Director.

C. If a written request is received prior to the due date, the Director, for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and file returns.

D. The Director shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received or refunded. The Director shall apply payments first against all penalties and interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer.

Any license issued upon payment with an NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the Director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $40.00 NSF fee) is received.

G. The Director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees, when and as due under this chapter.

All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and State tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the Director or its duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the Director or a duly authorized agent.

A. If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the City, it shall be sufficient if such person (1) produces within the City such books and records as may be required by the Director, or (2) bears the cost of examination by the Director’s agent at the place where such books and records are kept; provided, that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the Director the estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.

The Director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the City by the taxpayer. The Director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).


5.05.080 Accounting methods.

A. A taxpayer may file tax returns in each reporting period with amounts based upon cash receipts only if the taxpayer’s books of account are kept on a cash receipts basis.

B. The Director shall compute interest in accordance with RCW 82.32.050, as it now exists or as it may be amended.

A. If, upon receipt of an application for a refund, or during an audit or examination of the taxpayer’s records and tax returns, the Director determines that the amount of tax, penalty, or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than 4 years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

B. The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the Director discovers that a refund or credit is due.

C. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the Director and by the issuance of a City check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the City may provide.

D. Any final judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction for tax, penalties, interest, or costs paid by any person shall be paid in the same manner as provided in subsection C of this section, upon the filing with the Director a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

E. The Director shall compute interest on refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed a taxpayer in accordance with RCW 82.32.060, as it now exists or as it may be amended.

No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection D if the person who has engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the Director of the need to be licensed.

E. If the Director determines that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from the taxpayer’s failure to follow specific written tax reporting instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

F. If the Director finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable, the Director shall assess a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(6), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

5.05.140 Cancellation of penalties. 

A. The Director may cancel any penalties imposed under IMC 5.05.130(A) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date. The Director has no authority to cancel any other penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in subsection C of this section. 

B. A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the Director within 30 days after the date the Department mails the notice that the penalties are due. The request must be in writing and contain competent proof of all pertinent facts supporting a reasonable cause determination. In all cases the burden of proving the facts rests upon the taxpayer. 

C. The Director may cancel the penalties in IMC 5.05.130(A) 1 time if a person:

2. Was unaware of its responsibility to file and pay tax; and

5.05.150 Taxpayer quitting business – Liability of successor.

A. Whenever any taxpayer quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of his business or his stock of goods, any tax payable hereunder shall become immediately due and payable. Such taxpayer shall, within 10 days thereafter, make a return and pay the tax due. 

B. Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the City from the taxpayer until such time as: (1) the taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the City showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due, or (2) more than 6 months has passed since the successor notified the Director of the acquisition and the Director has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment. 

C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer. 

D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the Director of the acquisition, and the Department does not within 6 months of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax. (Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).


5.05.160 Administrative appeal. 

Any person, except 1 who has failed to comply with IMC 5.05.070, aggrieved by the amount of the fee or tax determined by the Director to be required under the provisions of this chapter may pay the amount due and appeal from such determination by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk. The City Administrator shall, as soon as practical, fix a time and place for the hearing of such appeal, and shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the parties. The hearing shall be conducted by the City Administrator in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1.32 IMC. The decision of the City Administrator shall indicate the correct amount of the fee or tax owing. (Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).


5.05.170 Judicial review of administrative appeal decision. 

The taxpayer or the City may obtain judicial review of the City Administrator’s administrative decision by applying for a writ of review in the King County Superior Court within 14 days from the date of the City Administrator’s decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in Chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules. The City shall have the same right of review from the administrative decision as does a taxpayer. (Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).


5.05.180 Director to make rules. 

The Director shall have the power, from time to time, to adopt, publish and enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter or with law for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and it shall be unlawful to violate or fail to comply with any such rule or regulation. (Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).


5.05.190 Ancillary allocation authority of Director.

The Director is authorized to enter into agreements with other Washington cities which impose an “eligible gross receipts tax”:

B. To allocate or apportion, in a manner that fairly reflects the gross receipts earned from activities conducted within the respective cities, the gross proceeds of sales, gross receipts, or gross income of the business, or taxes due from any person that is required to pay an eligible gross receipts tax to more than 1 Washington city;

C. To apply the City’s tax prospectively where a taxpayer has no office or place of business within the City and has paid tax on all gross income to another Washington city where the taxpayer is located; provided, that the other city maintains an eligible gross receipts tax, and the income was not derived from contracts with the City. (Ord. 2410 § 1, 2004).


5.05.200 Mailing of notices.

B. Most false alarms are the result of improper maintenance or improper or careless use of an alarm system.

C. Alarm companies are able to control the number of false alarms to which the Police must respond by appropriately and diligently screening alarms before calling them in to Police.

D. The public and the Police are subjected to needless danger when the Police are called to respond to false alarms.

E. Police officers responding to false alarms are not available to carry out other Police duties.

F. In the interest of using limited Police resources most effectively and efficiently, the number of false alarms can and must be reduced.

If, after issuing a written warning, the City Administrator or designee becomes aware of subsequent noncompliance, he shall apply for or impose the sanctions described in this section.

B. Any person who receives a citation for a violation of this chapter shall respond within 15 days from the date that notice of the infraction is issued by the City Code Compliance Officer. The issuance of an infraction by the City for a violation represents a determination that an infraction has been committed. A committed finding will be final if the violator does not respond as stated in this subsection.

C. Any person who receives a citation for a violation of this chapter may respond either by paying the fine amount to the City as established by this section, or requesting a hearing with the Issaquah Municipal Court.

D. If the infraction is found committed, either due to no response by the person cited, or a judicial determination that a violation has occurred by a preponderance of the evidence, then a person shall be punished with a fine of $250.00 for each and every day out of compliance. The existence of a prior written warning by the City Administrator or designee shall not be considered a first violation for purposes of this section. (Ord. 2644 §§ 1, 2, 2012; Ord. 2565 § 1, 2009).

From the adoption date of this chapter until October 1, 2010, the City and all food service businesses subject to this chapter should make reasonable efforts on a voluntary-compliance basis to procure recyclable or compostable food packaging, in anticipation of mandatory enforcement.

C. The provisions of IMC 8.07.020 through 8.07.050 shall become mandatory on October 1, 2010, except as hereinafter provided for in subsections D through F of this section.

D. A food service business may request a waiver from any part or all of the requirements in this chapter by filing a written request with the City Administrator or designee. The food service business seeking the waiver must show that the application of this chapter would create an undue hardship or practical difficulty based on the factors set forth in subsection F of this section. The City Administrator or designee may waive any specific requirement of this chapter for a period of time extending no later than July 1, 2011. The City Administrator or designee’s decision to grant or deny a waiver, in whole or in part, shall be mailed to the applicant in writing, with a statement of the permitted waiver length, and shall be a final nonappealable decision.

E. Prior to July 1, 2011, only the following items are exempt from the requirements of IMC 8.07.020 through 8.07.050: containers and lids specifically designed and used for hot liquid-based food and beverages, utensils (knives, forks and spoons), foil-backed and composite papers used to wrap hot food, straws, cocktail picks, portion cups 2 ounces and less used for hot food or requiring lids and the sale of raw meat or raw seafood in any container by any food service business. Prior to July 1, 2011, public educational institutions are also exempt from the requirements of IMC 8.07.020 through 8.07.050. The City Administrator or designee may provide for temporary product waivers related to the use of certain food service packaging items. Such product waiver determinations may be for an initial period of not more than 12 months. Such product waivers may only be granted for circumstances where commonly used recycling or composting services and technology cannot process the specific food service packaging or where suitable alternative products which meet performance and food safety standards are unavailable.

F. The following factors should be considered by the City Administrator or designee in granting or denying a waiver, in whole or in part, from the requirements of this chapter, as described in subsection D of this section: (1) the food service business seeking a waiver lacks the financial or other means to be in compliance with this chapter within a reasonable period of time; (2) the food service business seeking the waiver demonstrates, through due diligence, that particular products conforming to the requirements of this chapter are unavailable, pose recognized safety hazards, or will result in substantial financial harm; (3) the food service business seeking the waiver has maintained a business in Issaquah for less than 1 year. The factors listed herein are significant, but not intended to be the only considerations for the grant or denial of a waiver. The City Administrator or designee should make a decision concerning a request for waiver based on the preference of assisting a food service business to achieve compliance with this chapter while balancing the economic vitality of the business and striving to reduce any financially detrimental impacts on the applicant.

G. Except as provided for in subsection E of this section for temporary product waivers, on July 1, 2011, all waivers and exemptions from the requirements of this chapter will terminate and become invalid; and all provisions of this chapter will be subject to implementation and enforcement. (Ord. 2644 § 3, 2012; Ord. 2592 § 2, 2010; Ord. 2565 § 1, 2009).

10.42.020 Notice of infraction.

A. Whenever any vehicle is photographed by an automatic traffic safety camera, a notice of infraction shall be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within 14 days of the violation, or to the renter of the vehicle within 14 days of establishing the renter’s name and address under this section.

B. If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the law enforcement agency shall, before a notice of infraction is issued, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within 18 days of receiving the written notice, provide to the issuing agency by return mail:

C. The law enforcement officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotos or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction.

A. In a traffic infraction case involving an infraction detected through the use of a photo enforcement system under RCW 46.63.170 and detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera under this chapter, proof that the particular vehicle described in the notice of traffic infraction was in violation of any such provision of this chapter, together with proof that the person named in the notice of traffic infraction was at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, constitutes in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person in control of the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred.

B. This presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states, under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony before the court, that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care, custody, or control of some person other than the registered owner. (Ord. 2647 § 1, 2012; Ord. 2526 § 1, 2008).

10.46.010 Purpose.

The purpose of the commute trip reduction (CTR) plan is to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion and minimize energy consumption. These regulations are prepared to comply with RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.555. This CTR plan does this by requiring employer-based programs that encourage employees to find alternatives to drive-alone commuting with collaboration between the City of Issaquah and affected employers. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.015 Definitions.

Seasonal agricultural employees, including seasonal employees of processors of agricultural products, are excluded from the count of affected employees.

“Affected employer” means an employer that employs 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite covered by the commute trip reduction plan who are scheduled to begin their regular work day between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. (inclusive) on 2 or more weekdays for at least 12 continuous months. Construction worksites, when the expected duration of the construction is less than 2 years, are excluded from this definition. (Also see definition of employer.)

“Alternative mode” means any means of commute transportation other than that in which the single-occupant motor vehicle is the dominant mode, including telecommuting and compressed work week schedules if they result in reducing commute trips.

“Alternative work schedules” mean programs such as compressed work week schedules that eliminate work trips for affected employees.

“Base year” means the 12-month period which commences when a major employer is determined by the jurisdiction to be participating within the CTR program. The City of Issaquah uses this 12-month period as the basis upon which it develops commute trip reduction goals.

“Base year survey” or “baseline measurement” means the survey, during the base year, of employees at a major employer worksite to determine the drive-alone rate and vehicle miles traveled per employee at the worksite. The jurisdiction uses this measurement to develop commute trip reduction goals for the major employer. The baseline measurement must be implemented in a manner that meets the requirements specified by City of Issaquah.

“Good faith effort” means that an employer has met the minimum requirements identified in RCW 70.94.531 and this chapter, and is working collaboratively with the City of Issaquah to continue its existing CTR program or is developing and implementing program modifications likely to result in improvements to its CTR program over an agreed-upon length of time.

“Implementation” means active pursuit by an employer of the CTR goals of RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.555 and this chapter as evidenced by appointment of an employee transportation coordinator (ETC), distribution of information to employees regarding alternatives to drive-alone commuting, and commencement of other measures according to its approved CTR program and schedule.

“Major employer” means a private or public employer, including state agencies, that employs 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite who are scheduled to begin their regular work day between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on weekdays for at least 12 continuous months.

“Major employer worksite” or “affected employer worksite” or “worksite” means the physical location occupied by a major employer, as determined by the local jurisdiction.

10.46.020 City of Issaquah CTR plan.

The goals established for the jurisdiction and affected employers in the City of Issaquah Commute Trip Reduction Plan (September 2007) are incorporated herein by reference. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.030 CTR goals.

Issaquah’s goals for reductions in the proportions of drive-alone commute trips and vehicle miles traveled per employee by affected employers in Issaquah’s jurisdiction, major employment installations, and other areas designated by Issaquah are hereby established by Issaquah’s CTR plan. These goals establish the desired level of performance of 10 percent reduction in drive-alone trips and 13 percent in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for the CTR program in its entirety in Issaquah. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.031 Commute trip reduction goals.

The City of Issaquah will set the individual worksite goals for affected employers based on how the worksite can contribute to the City of Issaquah’s overall goal established in the CTR plan. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.032 Commute trip reduction goals for affected employers.

A. The drive-alone and VMT goals for affected employers in the City of Issaquah are hereby established as set forth in the CTR plan.

B. If the goals for an affected employer or newly affected employer are not listed in the CTR plan, they shall be established by Issaquah at a level designed to achieve City of Issaquah’s overall goals for the jurisdiction and other areas as designated by Issaquah. Issaquah or its approved designee shall provide written notification of the goals for each affected employer worksite by providing the information when Issaquah or its approved designee reviews the employer’s proposed program and incorporating the goals into the program approval issued by the City of Issaquah. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.040 Responsible agency.

The City of Issaquah is responsible for implementing these regulations, the CTR plan, and the Issaquah CTR program should be identified together with any authority necessary to carry out such responsibilities such as rule-making or certain administrative decisions. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.050 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any affected employer within the geographic limits of the CTR plan. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.051 Notification of applicability.

A. In addition to the City established public notification for adoption of these regulations, a notice of availability of a summary of these regulations, a notice of the requirements and criteria for affected employers to comply with these regulations, and subsequent amendments shall be published at least once in City of Issaquah’s official newspaper not more than 30 days after adoption of these regulations or amendments.

B. Affected employers located in Issaquah are to receive written notification that they are subject to these regulations. Such notice shall be addressed to the company’s chief executive officer, senior official, CTR program manager, or registered agent at the worksite. Such notification shall provide 90 days for the affected employer to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by Issaquah.

C. Affected employers that, for whatever reason, do not receive notice within 30 days of passage of these regulations and are either notified or identify themselves to Issaquah within 90 days of the passage of these regulations will be granted an extension to assure up to 90 days within which to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by Issaquah.

D. Affected employers that have not been identified or do not identify themselves within 90 days of the passage of these regulations and do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by Issaquah within 90 days from the passage of these regulations are in violation of this chapter.

E. If an affected employer has already performed a baseline measurement, or an alternative acceptable to Issaquah, under Issaquah’s previous CTR program, the employer is not required to perform another baseline measurement. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.052 Newly affected employers.

A. Employers meeting the definition of affected employer in this chapter must identify themselves to Issaquah within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries outlined in the CTR plan or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees. Employers who do not identify themselves within 90 days are in violation of this chapter.

B. Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by Issaquah. Employers who do not perform a baseline measurement within 90 days of receiving written notification that they are subject to these regulations are in violation of this chapter.

C. Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to Issaquah. The program will be developed in consultation with the City to be consistent with the goals of the CTR plan. The program shall be implemented not more than 90 days after approval by Issaquah. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties outlined in this chapter. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.053 Change in status as an affected employer.

Any of the following changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements:

A. If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is placed on a 12-month watch* and is subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers. At the end of the 12-month watch, if they no longer employ 100 affected employees, they are no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to provide documentation to the County that they are no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify Issaquah that it is no longer an affected employer. The burden of proof lies with the employer.

B. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.

C. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an unaffected employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).

* The 12-month watch is an administrative tool to reduce labor of having to start and stop a worksite into and out of the CTR program; getting them entered in the database, assignment of a state code and all of the other processing is labor intensive.


10.46.060 Requirements for employers – RCW 70.94.531.

An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and drive-alone commute trips. The CTR program must include the mandatory elements as described in IMC 10.46.061. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.061 Mandatory program elements.

Each employer’s CTR program shall include the following mandatory elements:

Any designated ETC must attend training provided by the City. The ETC and/or designee’s name, location, and telephone number must be prominently displayed physically or electronically at each affected worksite. The ETC shall oversee all elements of the employer’s CTR program and act as liaison between the employer and Issaquah. The objective is to have an effective transportation coordinator presence at each worksite; an affected employer with multiple sites may have 1 ETC for all sites.

B. Information Distribution. Information about alternatives to drive-alone commuting as well as a summary of the employer’s CTR program shall be provided to employees at least once a year and to new employees at the time of hire.

L. Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes, which reduces commute trips;

M. Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed work week, which reduces commute trips;

N. Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities, emergency taxi services, or guaranteed ride home programs;

O. Charging employees for parking, and/or the elimination of free parking;

P. Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site; and

Q. Instituting or increasing parking charges for drive-alone commuters. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.063 CTR program report and description.

Affected employers shall review their program and file a regular progress report with Issaquah in accordance with the format provided by Issaquah.

The CTR program report and description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for the reporting period. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements.

At a minimum, the employer’s CTR program report and description must include:

A. A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;

B. The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;

C. Documentation on compliance with the mandatory CTR program elements (as described in IMC 10.46.061);

D. Description of any additional elements included in the employer’s CTR program (as described in IMC 10.46.062); and

E. A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer’s established goals. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.064 Biennial measure of employee commute behavior.

In addition to the mandatory baseline measurement, employers shall conduct a program evaluation as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect commute trip reduction program employee questionnaires (surveys) at least once every 2 years, and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.070 Record keeping.

Affected employers shall maintain a copy of their approved CTR program description and report, their CTR program employee questionnaire results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to Issaquah for a minimum of 48 months. Issaquah and the employer shall agree on the recordkeeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).

Schedule and Process for CTR Program Description and Report


10.46.081 Document review.

Issaquah shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or biennial report within 90 days of submission, the employer’s program or annual report is deemed accepted. Issaquah may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.082 Schedule.

Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, Issaquah shall establish the employer’s regular reporting date. This report will be provided in a form provided by Issaquah consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.083 Modification of CTR program elements.

Any affected employer may submit a request to Issaquah for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if 1 of the following conditions exists:

A. The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or

B. The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.

Issaquah may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.084 Extensions.

An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description and report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. Issaquah shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s biennial reporting date may be extended at the discretion of Issaquah. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).


10.46.085 Implementation of employer’s CTR program.

Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from Issaquah that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from Issaquah. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).

10.46.092 Program modification criteria.

The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:

A. If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program;

B. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required;

C. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable drive-alone or VMT reduction goal, Issaquah shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description and report, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. Issaquah shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, Issaquah will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by Issaquah within 10 working days of the conference. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).

An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of drive-alone trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by Issaquah at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program.

Issaquah will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. Issaquah shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. Issaquah shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year. (Ord. 2547 § 1, 2009).

3. The vacation is sought to enable the implementation of a plan, adopted by resolution or ordinance, that provides comparable or improved public access to the same shoreline area to which the streets or alleys sought to be vacated abut, had the properties included in the plan not been vacated.

B. Before adopting a resolution vacating a street or alley under subsection (A)(2) of this section, the City shall:

1. Compile an inventory of all rights-of-way within the City that abut the same body of water that is abutted by the street or alley sought to be vacated;

3. Hold a public hearing on the proposed vacation in the manner required by this chapter, where in addition to the normal requirements for publishing notice, notice of the public hearing is posted conspicuously on the street or alley sought to be vacated, which posted notice indicates that the area is public access, it is proposed to be vacated, and that anyone objecting to the proposed vacation should attend the public hearing or send a letter to a particular official indicating his or her objection; and

4. Make a finding that the street or alley sought to be vacated is not suitable for any of the purposes listed under subsection (B)(2) of this section, and that the vacation is in the public interest.

C. No vacation shall be effective until the fair market value has been paid for the street or alley that is vacated.

(Ord. 2386 § 1, 2004).

Further, the cable operator may pledge the assets of the cable system for the purpose of financing without the consent of the City; provided, that such pledge of assets shall not impair or mitigate the cable operator’s responsibilities and capabilities to meet all of its obligations under the provisions of this franchise. In the event of a change in control, the cable operator will continue to be bound by all provisions of the franchise.

5. A copy of the final report on each proof of performance test of each technical parameter defined in Part 76 of the rules and regulations of the FCC, as said rules may be modified from time to time.

6. Certificate of insurance showing compliance with the requirements in IMC 12.50.370.

7. Any additional information related to the operation of the cable system as reasonably requested by the City based on demonstrated legitimate need.

8. In addition to any record or report that may be required under a specific franchise, the City shall have access to, and the right to inspect, any books and records of a cable operator and its affiliates which are reasonably necessary to monitor and enforce the cable operator’s compliance with the provisions of a franchise at the cable operator’s business office, during normal business hours, and without unreasonably interfering with the cable operator’s business operations. The City may, in writing, request copies of any such records or books that are not identified as proprietary or confidential, and the cable operator shall provide such copies within 30 days of the transmittal of such request.

C. Annual Meeting. Throughout the term of the franchise, the cable operator shall meet with the City on at least an annual basis upon 30 days’ prior written notice from the City. Matters to be discussed include, but are not limited to, customer service, cable system performance, technical issues and other matters related to the cable operator’s operation of the cable system. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.260 Failure to report.

A. The refusal, failure, or neglect of a cable operator to file any of the reports, perform the tests or to provide access to books and records or to its system as required under this chapter where such refusal, failure or neglect is not remedied following due notice and an opportunity to cure; or the repeated refusal, failure or neglect to comply, even if individual failures are corrected after notice and opportunity to cure; or the inclusion of any materially false or misleading statement or representation in any report shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise.

B. For purposes of this section, unless otherwise set forth in a franchise agreement, notice is sufficient if the City notifies the cable operator in writing that the cable operator has failed to provide a requested report, perform a test, or provide access to books and records or to its plant. A cable operator will be deemed to have failed to cure unless it provides the requested reports, performs the tests or provides the access to books and records and to its plant as provided in the franchise. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.270 Construction timetable.

Any cable operator seeking a franchise calling for the construction of a new system or the upgrade or rebuild of an existing system shall include a construction timetable within its franchise and shall adhere to the schedule. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.280 Specialized services notification.

Each cable operator shall notify the City 30 days prior to the commencement of any new service including any specialized service which may be available only to a certain class or certain classes of subscribers. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.290 Rates.

A. The City reserves the right to regulate rates and charges imposed on subscribers by a cable operator, to the full extent permitted under applicable federal law. The City further reserves the right to establish, to the full extent permitted by law, regulatory policies, procedures, and penalties related to rate regulation.

B. CTC Review of Rates. The CTC shall have the responsibility of developing rate regulation policies and procedures consistent with applicable law. The CTC shall also be responsible for implementing such policies and procedures and making recommendations to the City Council in matters regarding rate regulation.

C. Schedule of Rates. Upon request from the City, a cable operator shall annually file with the City a full schedule of all cable service rates and all charges whatsoever made in connection with its cable system.

D. Uniformity of Rates. Rates shall be the same for the same or similar classes of subscribers throughout the franchise area. However, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a cable operator from offering promotional discounts or discounted rates for customers who are low income (according to applicable federal guidelines) and either permanently disabled or 65 years of age or older and who are the legal owners or tenants of the dwelling unit. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a cable operator from adjusting its prices to meet competition, in accordance with federal law and regulation.

E. The cable operator may pass through to its subscribers such external costs as are allowed under the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. However, the cable operator shall not proceed with any franchise-required activity where the cost of such may be passed through to subscribers externally unless it has first provided written notice to the City. Such notice shall include an analysis (description of service and calculation methodology per subscriber) of the financial impact of the activity to subscribers. The City, upon receiving such notice, shall consider waiving the franchise requirement, and, if so waived, the franchise shall be deemed amended. If the City has not waived the requirement, or otherwise responded to the notice within 60 days, the cable operator shall proceed with the activity and shall pass through the external costs in accordance with federal law. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.300 Franchise fees.

A. As compensation for a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, and in consideration of permission to use and occupy the public ways of the City for the construction, operation, maintenance and/or reconstruction of a cable system within the City, and in consideration of the regulatory burden imposed on the City by the cable operator’s cable system, a cable operator shall pay to the City a franchise fee in the amount equal to 5 percent of its gross revenues.

B. The cable operator’s franchise fee payments to the City shall be computed quarterly for the preceding quarter. Each payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days after the end of the preceding quarter, after which time interest will accrue. The quarters shall end respectively on the last day of March, June, September and December. In the event any payment due the City is not timely made, grantee shall pay, in addition to the amount due, interest at a rate of 12 percent per annum of the amount due, from the payment due date until the City receives the payment.

C. Each payment shall be accompanied by a written report to the City, verified by an authorized representative of the cable operator, containing an accurate statement in summarized form which includes a breakdown by category of the cable operator’s gross revenues and the computation of the payment amount.

D. The parties acknowledge that, at present, applicable federal law limits the City to collecting a franchise fee of 5 percent of gross revenues in a 12-month period. In the event that at any time throughout the term of this franchise, the City is authorized to collect an amount in excess of or less than 5 percent of gross revenues, then the cable franchises shall be amended by the parties consistent with such change.

E. Payment of the franchise fees under this franchise shall not exempt the cable operator from the payment of any other license fee, permit fee, tax or charge on the business, occupation, property or income of the cable operator that may be lawfully imposed by the City.

F. The cable operator agrees to meet with a representative of the City, upon request, to review the cable operator’s methodology of record-keeping, financial reporting, the computing of franchise fee obligations and other procedures, the understanding of which the City deems necessary for reviewing reports and records that are relevant to the enforcement of this chapter.

G. Franchise Fee Waiver. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an agreement by the City that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this chapter. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the City under the terms of this section. In the event that recomputation results in additional fees to be paid to the City, such amount shall be subject to a 12 percent interest charge from the date the payment was due until the time of actual payment. The period of limitation for recovery of franchise fees payable under a franchise shall be 6 years from the date on which payment by the grantee was due.

H. Upon 30 days’ prior written notice, but not more often than once each calendar year, the City shall have the right to inspect the cable operator’s financial records necessary to enforce the provisions of the franchise and to calculate any amounts determined to be payable pursuant to the franchise. Provided the cable operator cooperates in making all relevant records available upon request, the City will in good faith attempt to complete each audit within 6 months, and the audit period shall not be any greater than the previous 3 years, unless the City has information relating to previous years beyond the 3 years which, in its reasonable judgment, raises doubt as to the accuracy of payments made under the current or previous franchises, in which case an additional 3 years may be audited. If the audit shows that there has been an underpayment of franchise fees by 5 percent or more in a calendar year, then the cable operator shall pay the cost of the audit, such amount not to exceed $15,000. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.310 Nondiscrimination requirements.

A. A cable operator shall not deny service or discriminate against any persons on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. A cable operator shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity requirements of the FCC, as expressed in applicable federal statutes or regulations. A cable operator shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, State, and City laws, relating to nondiscrimination.

B. A cable operator shall not make or grant preference or advantages to any person, or to any user or potential user of the cable system (except as provided in this chapter) with regard to the availability of its cable services. In addition, the cable operator shall not deny access or charge different rates to any group of subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides. This provision is intended to prevent discrimination among subscribers as prohibited under the Cable Act and FCC regulations and shall not be deemed to prohibit promotional campaigns to stimulate subscriptions to the system, the offering of commercial or bulk discounted rates, discounted rates to seniors or low income subscribers, or other legitimate uses thereof. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.320 Consumer protection and customer service standards.

All cable operators shall comply with applicable FCC customer service standards, including 47 CFR 76.309 as said section presently exists and may be amended from time to time. The City reserves the right to adopt and enforce additional, different or more stringent standards if the City determines there is a need to do so. In particular, the following standards shall apply:

A. Local Office. Each cable operator shall maintain a business office in the greater Seattle area which shall be open during all usual business hours and have a publicly listed telephone with sufficient toll-free lines and call-handling equipment to ensure that FCC customer service standards are met. The phone system shall be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments may be received on a 24-hour basis. The telephone number or numbers required under this section shall be printed prominently in all correspondence and bills sent to subscribers within the City.

B. Local Service. A cable operator shall complete all standard installations within 7 business days after an order has been placed, unless otherwise requested by the potential subscriber. “Standard installations” shall include those that are located within 125 aerial feet of the cable operator’s distribution system. This standard must be met 95 percent of the time under normal operating conditions as measured on a quarterly basis. If the potential subscriber requests a nonstandard installation, or the cable operator determines that a nonstandard installation is required, the cable operator shall provide the potential subscriber in advance with a total installation cost estimate and an estimated date of completion. If a subscriber calls to report poor signal quality or interruptions attributable to the cable operator’s equipment, the cable operator shall begin working on the problem no later than the next day following the subscriber’s call; provided, that the subscriber is available or at such later time as is convenient for the subscriber. If an appointment is necessary, the subscriber may choose a 4-hour block of time during normal business hours or such other time that is convenient for the subscriber.

C. Consumer Complaints.

1. The cable operator shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon, and resolving complaints without intervention by the City (except where necessary) and shall publicize such procedures through printed documents at the cable operator’s sole expense.

2. Said written procedures shall describe a simple process by which any subscriber may submit a complaint by telephone or in writing to the cable operator regarding a disputed matter, or an alleged violation of any provision of these standards or any terms or conditions of the subscriber’s contract with the cable operator, or reasonable business practices.

3. The cable operator’s complaint procedures shall be filed with the City. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.330 Performance bond, liquidated damages and enforcement.

A. Performance Bond. As security for a cable operator’s faithful performance hereunder, the cable operator shall, within 30 days of the effective date of its franchise, deliver to the City, and shall maintain continuously in effect, a good and sufficient bond in the sum of $50,000 executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington as a surety, or by other sureties acceptable to the City, and in a form acceptable to the City; which bond or other surety shall be for the purpose of guaranteeing and shall stipulate that the cable operator shall strictly comply with each and every condition and covenant of its franchise and this chapter.

1. Cable operator may be required to obtain additional security, such as generally applicable construction bonds, in accordance with the City’s permitting requirements.

2. Cable operator shall pay all premiums or costs associated with maintaining the performance bond and shall keep the performance bond in full force and effect during the term of the franchise.

B. Liquidated Damages. Because a cable operator’s failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter and its franchise will result in damage to the City and because it will be impractical to determine the actual amount of such damages, the City and any cable operator shall agree upon and specify in a franchise certain amounts which represent both parties’ best estimate of the damages. The City shall calculate the amount of any damages as specified in a franchise. Neither the right to liquidated damages nor the payment of liquidated damages shall bar or otherwise limit the right of the City in a proper case to:

1. Obtain judicial enforcement of a cable operator’s obligations by means of specific performance, injunctive relief, mandamus or other remedies at law or in equity;

2. Consider any substantial violation or breach as grounds for forfeiture and termination of a franchise pursuant to this chapter; and

3. Consider any violation or breach as grounds for nonrenewal or nonextension of a franchise or issuance of a new franchise.

C. Force Majeure. A cable operator will not be held in violation under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of its franchise or this chapter, nor suffer any enforcement relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged violation occurred or was caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the cable operator to control. This includes war or riots, civil disturbances, floods or other natural catastrophes, labor stoppages or slowdowns not attributable to cable operator’s employees, or power outages exceeding back-up power supplies, and work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which the cable operator’s cable system is attached as well as verifiable unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.340 Acceptance.

No franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall become effective unless and until the grant has been unconditionally accepted by the cable operator. Within 60 days after the effective date of the ordinance or other City action granting a franchise, or within such extended period of time as may be authorized by the City, the cable operator shall file written acceptance of the franchise in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, together with the bonds, insurance certificate, applicable application fee, and other surety requirement provided in their franchise. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.350 Effect of franchise approval.

No franchise granted under this chapter shall be deemed to be an exclusive franchise and shall not in any manner prevent the City from constructing, operating, and/or maintaining a cable system or facilities of its own or granting other or further franchises to do so in, along, over, through, under, below or across any of the public ways, streets, avenues, and other public land and properties of every type and description. No franchise granted hereunder shall prevent or prohibit the City from using any of said roads, rights-of-way, streets or other public properties or affect the City’s jurisdiction over them. The City reserves full power to make all necessary changes, relocations, repairs, maintenance and improvement of all public ways and thoroughfares and other public properties of every type. In accepting any franchise, the cable operator acknowledges that its rights are subject to the police powers of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, and the cable operator agrees to comply with all applicable laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such power so long as the same do not unduly discriminate against any cable operator. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.360 Rules and regulations by the City.

A. A cable operator, through its franchise, is granted the right to operate its cable system using the public ways within the franchise area. Such use must be in compliance with all applicable Issaquah Municipal Code provisions. In the event of a conflict between the Issaquah Municipal Code and a franchise, the franchise shall control subject to the limitation of the City’s exercise of the police powers. Should any franchise or other applicable law be silent on an issue, this section shall control. A cable operator has the right to challenge any City ordinance or regulation that conflicts with its rights under its franchise.

B. In accepting any franchise, the cable operator shall acknowledge that its rights are subject to the legitimate rights of the police power of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the public and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the City pursuant to such power.

C. The provisions of IMC 12.60.040 and Article IV of Chapter 12.60 IMC governing the construction standards of facilities within the public ways shall apply to all cable operators granted a franchise. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.370 Insurance.

Unless otherwise provided in the franchise, each grantee shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring both the grantee and the City against claims for injuries to persons, death or damages to property which may arise from or in connection with the exercise of the rights, privileges and authority granted to the grantee:

A. Commercial general liability insurance, written on an occurrence basis. The insurance policy shall be endorsed to provide a per project general aggregate and there shall be no exclusions for liability arising from explosion, collapse or underground property damage. The policy shall have limits not less than:

1. $3,000,000 for bodily injury, property damage, products-completed operations, stop gap liability, personal injury and advertising injury, and liability assumed under an insured contract;

2. $6,000,000 general aggregate, per project aggregate and products-completed operations aggregate.

B. Automobile liability insurance covering all owned, nonowned, hired and leased vehicles with a minimum combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage of $2,000,000 per accident.

C. Worker’s compensation within statutory limits and employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000.

D. Pollution liability insurance shall be in effect throughout the entire franchise term, with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence, and $2,000,000 in the aggregate.

E. Excess or umbrella liability policy shall be excess over and at least as broad in coverage as the commercial general liability and automobile liability insurance with limits not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence and annual aggregate.

F. The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be maintained by the grantee throughout the term of the franchise, and such other period of time during which the grantee is operating without a franchise, or is engaged in the removal of its telecommunication facilities. The insurance policies shall include the City, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, employees, representatives, engineers, consultants and volunteers as additional insureds. The grantee shall provide a certificate of insurance (COI), together with the additional insured endorsement(s) to the City, upon acceptance of the franchise. Payment of deductibles and self-insured retentions shall be the sole responsibility of the grantee. The insurance required by this section shall apply separately to each insured against whom a claim is made or suit is brought. The grantee’s insurance shall be primary insurance with respect to the City, its officers, officials, employees, agents, consultants, and volunteers. Any insurance, self-insurance, or self-insured pool coverage maintained by the City shall be excess of the grantee’s insurance and shall not contribute with it. Receipt by the City of any certificate or evidence of insurance showing less coverage than required is not a waiver of grantee’s obligations to fulfill the requirements. Grantee may utilize primary and excess liability insurance policies to satisfy the insurance policy limits required in this section. Grantee’s excess liability insurance policy shall provide “follow form” coverage over its primary liability insurance policies.

G. Grantee is obligated to notify the City of any cancellation or intent not to renew any insurance policy required pursuant to this section 30 days prior to any such cancellation. Within 15 days prior to said cancellation or intent not to renew, grantee shall obtain and furnish to the City replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. Failure to provide the insurance cancellation notice and to furnish to the City replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section shall be considered a material breach of the franchise.

H. Grantee’s maintenance of insurance, its scope of coverage and limits as required herein shall not be construed to limit the liability of the grantee to the coverage provided by such insurance, or otherwise limit the City’s recourse to any remedy available at law or in equity. If the grantee maintains higher insurance limits than the minimums shown above, the City shall be insured for the full available limits of commercial general and excess or umbrella liability maintained by the grantee, irrespective of whether such limits maintained by the grantee are greater than those required by this code or whether any certificate of insurance furnished to the City evidences limits of liability lower than those maintained by the grantee. Further, grantee’s maintenance of insurance policies required by this franchise shall not be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by grantee.

I. Upon approval by the City and based on conditions set by the City in the franchise, the grantee may self-insure under the same terms as required by this section. Further, the CTC may modify these insurance requirements within the franchise as he/she deems necessary to comply with the City’s risk management policies or as otherwise approved by the City’s Risk Manager; provided, that any such changes provide adequate protection for the City. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.380 General indemnification.

No franchise shall be deemed to be granted under this chapter unless it includes an indemnity clause substantially conforming to the following:

A. Grantee hereby releases and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents, engineers, consultants, volunteers, and representatives from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person, for injury or death of any person or damage to property caused by or arising out of any acts or omissions of grantee, its agents, servants, officers, or employees by virtue of grantee’s exercise of the rights granted herein, or in any franchise or permit, These indemnification obligations shall extend to claims that are not reduced to a suit and any claims that may be compromised, prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation.

B. Inspection or acceptance by the City of any work performed by grantee at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. Provided, that grantee has been given prompt written notice by the City of any such claim, said indemnification obligations shall extend to claims which are not reduced to a suit and any claims which may be compromised prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation. The City’s failure to so notify and request indemnification shall not relieve grantee of any liability that grantee might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices grantee’s ability to defend such claim or suit. The City has the right to defend or participate in the defense of any such claim at its own costs, and has the right to approve any non-monetary settlement or other compromise of any such claim.

C. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the franchise is subject to RCW 4.24.115 then, in the event of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damages to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of the grantee and the City, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers, the grantee’s liability shall be only to the extent of the grantee’s negligence. It is further specifically and expressly understood that the indemnification provided constitutes the grantee’s waiver of immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance, solely for the purposes of this indemnification. The obligations of grantee under this subsection shall be mutually negotiated by the parties, and grantee shall acknowledge that the City would not enter into a franchise without grantee’s waiver.

D. The City shall promptly notify grantee of any claim or suit and request in writing that grantee indemnify the City. Grantee may choose counsel to defend the City subject to the City’s consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld and consistent with this subsection. City’s failure to so notify and request indemnification shall not relieve grantee of any liability that grantee might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices grantee’s ability to defend such claim or suit. In the event that grantee refuses the tender of defense in any suit or any claim, as required pursuant to the indemnification provisions within a franchise, and said refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such other tribunal that the parties shall agree to decide the matter), to have been a wrongful refusal on the part of grantee, grantee shall pay all of the City’s reasonable costs for defense of the action, including all expert witness fees, costs, and attorney’s fees, and including costs and fees incurred in recovering under this indemnification provision. If separate representation to fully protect the interests of both parties is necessary, such as a conflict of interest between the City and the counsel selected by grantee to represent the City, then the grantee and City shall immediately meet and confer and determine whether alternative counsel or other alternative is possible to resolve the concern. If no alternative is agreeable to the parties, upon the prior written approval and consent of grantee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof, and grantee shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel, except that grantee shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel on behalf of the City for the City to bring or pursue any counterclaims or interpleader action, equitable relief, restraining order or injunction. The City’s fees and expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses, such as consultants and expert witness fees, and shall also include the reasonable value of any services rendered by the counsel retained by the City but shall not include outside attorneys’ fees for services that are unnecessarily duplicative of services provided the City by grantee. The grantee and the City shall cooperate and cause their employees and agents to cooperate with each other in the defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each party shall be available to the other party with respect to any such defense.

E. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, grantee assumes the risk of damage to its telecommunication facilities located in the public ways and upon City-owned property from activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees and contractors, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from any sole negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the City, its officers, agents, employees or contractors. In no event shall the City be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including by way of example and not limitation lost profits, lost revenue, loss of goodwill, or loss of business opportunity in connection with its performance or failure to perform under a franchise. Grantee further agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City against any claims for damages, including, but not limited to, business interruption damages and lost profits, brought by or under users of grantee’s facilities as the result of any interruption of service due to damage or destruction of grantee’s facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees or contractors.

F. These indemnification requirements shall survive the expiration, revocation or termination of a franchise. Further, the CTC may modify these indemnification requirements within the franchise as it deems necessary to comply with the City’s risk management policies or as otherwise approved by the City’s Risk Manager; provided, that any such changes provide adequate protection for the City. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.390 Contractors and subcontractors.

A grantee’s contractors and subcontractors shall be licensed and bonded in accordance with the City’s ordinances, regulations, and requirements. Further, grantee’s contractors and subcontractors that perform work in the public ways must include the City as an additional insured on their insurance policies consistent with the requirements of this chapter. Work by contractors and subcontractors is subject to the same restrictions, limitations, and conditions as if the work were performed by a grantee. Grantee shall be responsible for all work performed by its contractors and subcontractors and others performing work on its behalf as if the work were performed by it and shall ensure that all such work is performed in compliance with the franchise and applicable law. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.400 Notice and duty to cure.

A. If the City believes that a cable operator has failed to perform any nonmaterial obligation under its franchise, the City shall notify the cable operator in writing, stating with reasonable specificity the nature of the alleged default. The cable operator shall have 30 days from the receipt of such notice to:

1. Respond to the City, contesting the City’s assertion that a default has occurred, and request a meeting in accordance with subsection B of this section; or

2. Cure the default; or

3. Notify the City that the cable operator cannot cure the default within 30 days, because of the nature of the default. In the event the default cannot be cured within 30 days, the cable operator shall promptly take all reasonable steps to cure the default and notify the City in writing and in detail as to the exact steps that will be taken and the projected completion date. In such case, the City may set a meeting in accordance with subsection B of this section to determine whether additional time beyond the 30 days specified above is indeed needed, and whether the cable operator’s proposed completion schedule and steps are reasonable.

B. If the cable operator does not cure the alleged default within the cure period stated above, or denies the default and requests a meeting in accordance with subsection (A)(1) of this section, or the City orders a meeting in accordance with subsection (A)(3) of this section, the City shall set a meeting to investigate said issues and the existence of the alleged default. The City shall notify the cable operator of the meeting in writing and such meeting shall take place no less than 15 business days after the cable operator’s receipt of notice of the meeting. At the meeting, cable operator shall be provided an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence in its defense.

C. If, after the meeting, the City determines that a default exists, the cable operator and the City may agree on a plan and schedule to cure the default. Absent such agreement, the City shall order the cable operator to correct or remedy the default or breach within 30 days or within such other reasonable time frame beyond 30 days as the City shall determine. In the event cable operator does not cure the default within such time to the City’s reasonable satisfaction, the City may:

1. Recommend the termination of the cable operator’s franchise pursuant to the termination procedures in this chapter; or

2. Pursue any other legal or equitable remedy available under the franchise and applicable law.

D. The determination as to whether a nonmaterial violation of this franchise has occurred shall be within the discretion of the City. Any such determination by the City must be in writing and must be based upon findings that include the cable operator’s submissions; provided, that any such determination may be subject to appeal to the City Council or review by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.410 No waiver of terms.

A failure of the City on 1 or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any term or condition of this chapter shall not excuse a cable operator from complying with said term or condition on any other occasion. A failure of either the City or cable operator on 1 or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any term or condition of a franchise shall not excuse the other party from complying with said term or condition on any other occasion. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).


12.50.420 Severability.

If any provision of this chapter is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any federal or State agency having jurisdiction over its subject matter, to be invalid and in conflict with any federal or State law or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is determined by that court or agency to require modification in order to conform to the requirements of that law or regulation, then that part of this chapter will be ineffective, and such determination will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provisions. If that federal or State law or regulation is subsequently repealed or amended so that the provision of this chapter determined to be invalid or subject to modification is no longer in conflict with that law or regulation, that provision will again become effective and will thereafter be binding on any affected cable operator. (Ord. 2896 § 2, 2020).

The purpose of this article is to set forth certain terms and conditions which are common to all telecommunication franchises, including cable franchises issued under Chapter 12.50 IMC. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in such a franchise, the provisions of this article apply to all franchises granted by the City. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.230 Acceptance.

No franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall become effective unless and until the franchise has been accepted by the grantee. Either before the franchise is presented to Council or within 60 days after the effective date of the ordinance or other City action granting a franchise, or within such extended period of time as may be authorized by the City, the applicant shall file written acceptance of the franchise in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, together with the bonds, insurance policies, and security fund required by this article. Acceptance of a franchise shall consist of executing the written agreement granting the franchise and returning said franchise to the City within the period of time specified herein. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.240 Police power.

In accepting any franchise, the grantee shall acknowledge that its rights are subject to the legitimate rights of the police power of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the public and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the City pursuant to such power. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.250 Rules and regulations by the City.

In addition to the inherent powers of the City to regulate and control any franchise it issues, the authority granted to it by the Cable Act, and those powers expressly reserved by the City, or agreed to and provided for in any franchise, the right and power is hereby reserved by the City to promulgate such additional regulations as it may find necessary in the exercise of its lawful powers giving due regard to the rights of grantees hereunder. Except as provided in this chapter, the foregoing does not allow for amendment by the City of material terms of any franchise it issues without the consent of the grantee. The City Council reserves the right to delegate its authority for franchise administration to a designated City department director. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.260 Duty to provide information.

A. Within 30 days of a written request from the Public Works Director, and no more frequently than once per calendar year, each grantee shall furnish the City with information sufficient to demonstrate:

1. That grantee has complied with all requirements of this chapter.

2. That all sales, business and occupation, utility and/or telecommunication taxes due to the City in connection with the telecommunication services and facilities provided by the grantee have been properly collected and paid by the grantee.

B. Applicable books, records, maps and other documents maintained by the grantee with respect to its facilities within the public ways shall be made available for inspection by the City at reasonable times and intervals; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to require a grantee to violate State or federal law regarding subscriber privacy, nor shall this section be construed to require a grantee to disclose proprietary or confidential information without adequate safeguards for its confidential or proprietary nature. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.270 Leased capacity.

A grantee shall have the right, without prior City approval, to offer or provide fiber capacity or bandwidth to other carriers, resellers, customers, or subscribers consistent with a franchise; provided, however, that the grantee shall remain responsible for compliance with this chapter and such franchise. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.280 Contractors and subcontractors.

A grantee’s contractors and subcontractors shall be licensed and bonded in accordance with the City’s ordinances, regulations, and requirements. Work by contractors and subcontractors is subject to the same restrictions, limitations, and conditions as if the work were performed by a grantee. Grantee shall be responsible for all work performed by its contractors and subcontractors and others performing work on its behalf as if the work were performed by it and shall ensure that all such work is performed in compliance with the franchise and applicable law. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.290 Insurance.

Unless otherwise provided in the franchise, each grantee shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring both the grantee and the City against claims for injuries to persons, death or damages to property which may arise from or in connection with the exercise of the rights, privileges and authority granted to the grantee:

A. Commercial General Liability Insurance Written on an Occurrence Basis. The insurance policy shall be endorsed to provide a per project general aggregate and there shall be no exclusions for liability arising from explosion, collapse or underground property damage. The policy shall have limits not less than:

1. $3,000,000 for bodily injury, property damage, products-completed operations, stop gap liability, personal injury and advertising injury, and liability assumed under an insured contract;

2. $6,000,000 general aggregate, per project aggregate and products-completed operations aggregate.

B. Automobile liability insurance covering all owned, nonowned, hired and leased vehicles with a minimum combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage of $2,000,000 per accident.

C. Worker’s compensation within statutory limits and employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000.

D. Pollution liability insurance shall be in effect throughout the entire franchise term, with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence, and $2,000,000 in the aggregate.

E. Excess or umbrella liability policy shall be excess over and at least as broad in coverage as the commercial general liability and automobile liability insurance with limits not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence and annual aggregate.

F. The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be maintained by the grantee throughout the term of the franchise, and such other period of time during which the grantee is operating without a franchise, or is engaged in the removal of its telecommunication facilities. The insurance policies shall include the City, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, employees, representatives, engineers, consultants and volunteers as additional insureds. The grantee shall provide a certificate of insurance (COI), together with the additional insured endorsement(s) to the City, upon acceptance of the franchise. Payment of deductibles and self-insured retentions shall be the sole responsibility of the grantee. The insurance required by this section shall apply separately to each insured against whom a claim is made or suit is brought. The grantee’s insurance shall be primary insurance with respect to the City, its officers, officials, employees, agents, consultants, and volunteers. Any insurance, self-insurance, or self-insured pool coverage maintained by the City shall be excess of the grantee’s insurance and shall not contribute with it. Receipt by the City of any certificate or evidence of insurance showing less coverage than required is not a waiver of grantee’s obligations to fulfill the requirements. Grantee may utilize primary and excess liability insurance policies to satisfy the insurance policy limits required in this section. Grantee’s excess liability insurance policy shall provide “follow form” coverage over its primary liability insurance policies.

G. Grantee is obligated to notify the City of any cancellation or intent not to renew any insurance policy required pursuant to this section 30 days prior to any such cancellation. Within 15 days prior to said cancellation or intent not to renew, grantee shall obtain and furnish to the City replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. Failure to provide the insurance cancellation notice and to furnish to the City replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section shall be considered a material breach of the franchise.

H. Grantee’s maintenance of insurance, its scope of coverage and limits as required herein shall not be construed to limit the liability of the grantee to the coverage provided by such insurance, or otherwise limit the City’s recourse to any remedy available at law or in equity. If the grantee maintains higher insurance limits than the minimums shown above, the City shall be insured for the full available limits of commercial general and excess or umbrella liability maintained by the grantee, irrespective of whether such limits maintained by the grantee are greater than those required by this code or whether any certificate of insurance furnished to the City evidences limits of liability lower than those maintained by the grantee. Further, grantee’s maintenance of insurance policies required by this franchise shall not be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by grantee.

I. Upon approval by the City and based on conditions set by the City in the franchise, the grantee may self-insure under the same terms as required by this section. Further, the Public Works Director may modify these insurance requirements within the franchise as he/she deems necessary to comply with the City’s risk management policies or as otherwise approved by the City’s Risk Manager; provided, that any such changes provide adequate protection for the City. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.300 General indemnification.

No franchise shall be deemed to be granted under this chapter unless it includes an indemnity clause substantially conforming to the following:

A. Grantee hereby releases, and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents, engineers, consultants, volunteers, and representatives from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person, for injury or death of any person or damage to property caused by or arising out of any acts or omissions of grantee, its agents, servants, officers, or employees by virtue of grantee’s exercise of the rights granted herein, or in any franchise or permit, These indemnification obligations shall extend to claims that are not reduced to a suit and any claims that may be compromised, prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation.

B. Inspection or acceptance by the City of any work performed by grantee at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. Provided, that grantee has been given prompt written notice by the City of any such claim, said indemnification obligations shall extend to claims which are not reduced to a suit and any claims which may be compromised prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation. The City’s failure to so notify and request indemnification shall not relieve grantee of any liability that grantee might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices grantee’s ability to defend such claim or suit. The City has the right to defend or participate in the defense of any such claim at its own costs, and has the right to approve any non-monetary settlement or other compromise of any such claim.

C. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the franchise is subject to RCW 4.24.115, then, in the event of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damages to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of the grantee and the City, its officers, officials, employees, and volunteers, the grantee’s liability shall be only to the extent of the grantee’s negligence. It is further specifically and expressly understood that the indemnification provided constitutes the grantee’s waiver of immunity under Industrial Insurance, RCW Title 51, solely for the purposes of this indemnification. The obligations of grantee under this subsection shall be mutually negotiated by the parties, and grantee shall acknowledge that the City would not enter into a franchise without grantee’s waiver.

D. The City shall promptly notify grantee of any claim or suit and request in writing that grantee indemnify the City. Grantee may choose counsel to defend the City subject to the City’s consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld and consistent with this subsection. City’s failure to so notify and request indemnification shall not relieve grantee of any liability that grantee might have, except to the extent that such failure prejudices grantee’s ability to defend such claim or suit. In the event that grantee refuses the tender of defense in any suit or any claim, as required pursuant to the indemnification provisions within a franchise, and said refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such other tribunal that the parties shall agree to decide the matter), to have been a wrongful refusal on the part of grantee, grantee shall pay all of the City’s reasonable costs for defense of the action, including all expert witness fees, costs, and attorney’s fees, and including costs and fees incurred in recovering under this indemnification provision. If separate representation to fully protect the interests of both parties is necessary, such as a conflict of interest between the City and the counsel selected by grantee to represent the City, then the grantee and City shall immediately meet and confer and determine whether alternative counsel or other alternative is possible to resolve the concern. If no alternative is agreeable to the parties, upon the prior written approval and consent of grantee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof, and grantee shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel, except that grantee shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel on behalf of the City for the City to bring or pursue any counterclaims or interpleader action, equitable relief, restraining order or injunction. The City’s fees and expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses, such as consultants and expert witness fees, and shall also include the reasonable value of any services rendered by the counsel retained by the City but shall not include outside attorneys’ fees for services that are unnecessarily duplicative of services provided the City by grantee. The grantee and the City shall cooperate and cause their employees and agents to cooperate with each other in the defense of any such claim and the relevant records of each party shall be available to the other party with respect to any such defense.

E. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, grantee assumes the risk of damage to its telecommunication facilities located in the public ways and upon City-owned property from activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees and contractors, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from any sole negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the City, its officers, agents, employees or contractors. In no event shall the City be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including by way of example and not limitation lost profits, lost revenue, loss of goodwill, or loss of business opportunity in connection with its performance or failure to perform under a franchise. Grantee further agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City against any claims for damages, including, but not limited to, business interruption damages and lost profits, brought by or under users of grantee’s facilities as the result of any interruption of service due to damage or destruction of grantee’s facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees or contractors.

F. These indemnification requirements shall survive the expiration, revocation or termination of a franchise. Further, the Public Works Director may modify these indemnification requirements within the franchise as he/she deems necessary to comply with the City’s risk management policies or as otherwise approved by the City’s Risk Manager; provided, that any such changes provide adequate protection for the City. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.310 Security.

Prior to or upon acceptance of a franchise pursuant to this chapter, each grantee shall establish a permanent security instrument with the City by furnishing a security instrument in an amount as determined by the Public Works Director in cash, bond, an unconditional letter of credit or other security instrument acceptable to the City, which security instrument shall be maintained at the sole expense of the grantee so long as any of the grantee’s telecommunication facilities are located within the public ways of the City.

A. The security instrument shall serve as security for the full and complete performance of the franchise and of this chapter, including any costs, expenses, damages or loss the City pays or incurs, including civil penalties, because of any failure attributable to the grantee to comply with the codes, ordinances, rules, regulations or permits of the City.

B. Before any claims are made against the security instrument, the City shall give written notice to the grantee:

1. Describing the act, default or failure to be remedied, or the damages, cost or expenses which the City has incurred by reason of the grantee’s act or default;

2. Providing a reasonable opportunity for the grantee to first cure the existing or ongoing default or failure, if applicable;

3. Providing a reasonable opportunity for the grantee to pay any monies due the City before the City withdraws the amount thereof from the security, if applicable;

4. That the grantee will be given an opportunity to review the act, default or failure described in the notice with the Public Works Director.

C. Grantee shall ensure the security instrument is the most current and shall furnish an updated security instrument upon 30 days’ written notice from the City.

D. Upon termination or expiration of a franchise, the City shall release the security instrument to the grantee within 30 days after removal or abandonment in place (if allowed) of grantee’s telecommunications facilities within the public ways. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.320 Construction and warranty bond.

A. Unless otherwise provided in a franchise, or where a standing bond in an amount and format agreeable to the Public Works Director has been retained by a grantee, a bond written by a surety acceptable to the City in the amount by the City’s construction design standards shall be deposited before construction is commenced.

B. The construction bond shall remain in force until 60 days after substantial completion of the work, as determined by the Public Works Director, including restoration of public ways and other property affected by the construction.

C. The construction bond shall guarantee, to the satisfaction of the City:

1. Timely completion of construction;

2. Construction in compliance with applicable plans, permits, technical codes and standards;

3. Proper location of the facilities as specified by the City;

4. Restoration of the public ways and other property affected by the construction;

5. The submission of as-built drawings after completion of the work as required by this chapter; and

6. Timely payment and satisfaction of all claims, demands or liens for labor, material or services provided in connection with the work.

D. A warranty bond is required during the warranty period to ensure adequate funds for the City to perform the necessary warranty work should grantee not do so for improvements against any defective work or labor done or defective materials used in the performance of the improvements throughout the warranty period. The warranty period shall be for 2 years following completion and acceptance of the improvements unless a longer warranty period is required by the Public Works Director. This security shall be consistent with the amount determined in the City’s construction design standards and shall be posted prior to the release of the construction bond. Such bond will be released by the City consistent with the requirements of the City’s construction design standards. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.330 Coordination of construction activities.

All grantees and other persons with telecommunication facilities occupying public ways of the City are required to cooperate with the City and with each other.

A. Upon request, grantees shall provide the City with a schedule of their proposed construction activities in, around, or that may affect the public ways within the next 12 months.

B. Each grantee shall meet with the City and other grantees of the public ways annually or as determined by the City to schedule and coordinate construction in the public ways.

C. To the extent possible, all construction locations, activities and schedules shall be coordinated to minimize public inconvenience, disruption or damages. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.340 Assignments or transfers of grant.

Ownership or control of a telecommunication system or franchise may not, directly or indirectly, be transferred, assigned or disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation or other act of the grantee, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written notice to the City.

A. Absent extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances, no grant, system or integral part of a system shall be assigned or transferred before construction of the telecommunication system has been completed.

B. The grantee and the proposed assignee or transferee of the grant or system shall provide and certify the following information to the City not less than 120 days prior to the proposed date of transfer:

1. Complete information setting forth the nature, terms and condition of the proposed transfer or assignment;

Such transfer shall not be effective until the written acceptance and accompanying insurance and bonds are submitted to the City.

E. The requirements of this section shall apply to any transactions which singularly or collectively result in a change of 50 percent or more of the ownership or working control of the grantee, of the ownership or working control of a telecommunication system, of the ownership or working control of affiliated entities having ownership or working control of the grantee or of a telecommunication system, or of control of the capacity or bandwidth of the grantee’s telecommunication system, facilities or substantial parts thereof. Transactions between affiliated entities are not exempt from this notice requirement. A grantee shall promptly notify the City prior to any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of a grantee’s company. Notice shall not be required for mortgaging purposes or if said transfer is from a grantee to another person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).

A. That corrective action has been, or is being actively and expeditiously, pursued to remedy the violation or noncompliance;

The City Council shall provide the grantee with notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard concerning the matter.

Where substantial new relevant information which was not considered in the making of the decision appealed from has been presented, the City Council shall make its decision only upon the basis of the facts presented at the hearing of the appeal, or may elect to remand the matter for reconsideration by the Public Works Director in light of the additional information.

12.60.460 Construction schedule.

If different from the schedule provided to the City pursuant to IMC 12.60.430, the grantee shall submit a written construction schedule to the Public Works Director in accordance with the permit requirements before commencing any work in or about the public ways. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).

The Public Works Director and his or her designee shall be provided access to the work and such further information as he or she may require to ensure compliance with such requirements. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).

12.60.490 Survey of underground facilities.

If the construction permit specifies the location of facilities by depth, line, grade, proximity to other facilities or other standard, the grantee shall, at its sole cost, cause the location of such facilities to be verified by a State-registered land surveyor. Upon direction of the City, the grantee shall relocate or remove any of its facilities which are not located in compliance with permit requirements. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.500 Location of facilities.

Except for wireless communication facilities specifically permitted pursuant to Chapter 18.22 IMC, all facilities shall be constructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and conditions, unless otherwise specified in a franchise. Grantee shall be responsible for all costs associated with undergrounding its facilities except as otherwise provided herein or within State or federal law.

A. All new facilities must be placed underground, unless otherwise approved by the City pursuant to subsection F or G of this section. For purposes of clarity, new facilities include but are not limited to all new wireline facilities and over-lashing on existing facilities.

B. A grantee shall install its new facilities within an existing underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such facility and the grantee is able to access such underground duct or conduit for a commercially reasonable fee; otherwise grantee shall place its new facilities within its own new underground duct or conduit. The grantee is encouraged to place conduit underground that can accommodate both the new facilities and future facilities, including any existing above ground facilities that may be relocated underground at a later date.

C. Whenever any existing electric utilities are being relocated, or upon a City project within a public way of the City, a grantee with permission to occupy the same public way must also relocate its facilities underground or along an alternative public way consistent with the requirements of RCW 35.99.060.

D. If requested, a grantee shall provide the City with additional ducts and conduits and related structures necessary to access the ducts and conduits; provided, that the terms and conditions under which such additional ducts and/or conduits are provided shall be consistent with RCW 35.99.070.

E. These locational requirements shall apply even if the grantee is providing services to a wireless communication facility in the public ways, and such wireless communication facility is allowed to remain above ground.

F. Grantee may request that the Public Works Director allow a deviation from the requirements in this section by establishing that such compliance would be an undue hardship to the grantee, a user of the facilities, or any other affected person. The term “undue hardship” shall mean either:

1. The installation would be technologically unfeasible; or

2. The impact of the underground construction outweighs the general welfare consideration in requiring underground construction; or

3. Delay of the installation of the underground facilities would better coordinate the project with other private improvements which are in the permitting process or public improvements shown on the capital improvement or transportation improvement elements of the Comprehensive Plan.

G. The Director may deviate from these requirements if a statute or tariff prohibits the enforcement thereof or requires the City or rate payers to pay for such undergrounding. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.510 Compliance with one call locator service.

All grantees shall, before commencing any construction in the public ways, comply with all regulations of Chapter 19.122 RCW, the one call locator service. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.520 Interference with the public ways.

No grantee may locate or maintain its facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public ways by the City, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the public ways. All such facilities shall be moved by the grantee, at the grantee’s cost, temporarily or permanently, as determined by the Public Works Director. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.530 Damage to property.

No grantee nor any person acting on a grantee’s behalf shall take any action or permit any action to be done which may impair or damage any City property, public ways of the City, other ways or other property, whether publicly or privately owned, located in, on or adjacent thereto. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.540 Repair and emergency work.

In the event of an unexpected repair or emergency, a grantee may commence such repair and emergency response work as required under the circumstances, provided the grantee shall notify the City as promptly as possible, before such repair or emergency work commences or as soon thereafter if advance notice is not practicable, but no more than 48 hours after such emergency repair commences. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.550 Maintenance of facilities.

Each grantee shall maintain its facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, State and local requirements. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.560 Relocation or removal of facilities.

A. RCW 35.99.060 shall govern the relocation of facilities within the public ways.

B. In the case of relocation projects where the City hires and designates an independent contractor to accommodate and coordinate the conversion of overhead utilities within a City project, if the grantee decides to participate in the joint trench opportunity then the grantee shall pay to the City the grantee’s portion of the traffic control and trench costs, including excavation and other associated costs, management and coordination costs, trench bedding, and backfill commensurate with the grantee’s proportionate share of trench usage. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if bids from the City’s contractor for placement of the grantee’s conduits and vaults/pedestals in the supplied joint trench, in the reasonable estimation of the grantee, are not acceptable, the grantee shall have the option to utilize contractor(s) of its choice to complete the required work. The City’s contractor shall coordinate with the grantee’s contractor(s) to provide reasonable notice and time to complete the placement of the grantee’s facilities in the supplied joint trench. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.570 Building moving.

Whenever any person shall have obtained permission from the City to use any street or public way for the purpose of moving any building, a grantee shall have 5 business days to coordinate raising or removing its facilities to accommodate the moving of the building. In no case shall raising or removing its facilities to accommodate the moving of the building take longer than 30 days unless agreed to in writing by the person moving the building; provided, that the person desiring to move the building shall comply with all requirements of the City for the movement of buildings. All raising or removing of grantee’s facilities which obstruct the removal of such building shall be at the expense of the person desiring to move the building. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).


12.60.580 Removal of unauthorized facilities.

A. Within 30 days following written notice from the City informing a person who is in violation of this chapter that unauthorized facilities were discovered in the public way, any grantee or other person that owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized telecommunication or cable facilities or related appurtenances within the public ways of the City shall, at its own expense, remove such facilities or appurtenances from the public ways of the City or cure such violation as provided for in the notice. Telecommunication or cable facilities are unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:

1. Upon termination of the grantee’s franchise.

2. Upon abandonment of a facility within the public ways of the City. Such property shall be deemed abandoned if the grantee does not respond within 120 days of notice of unauthorized facilities from the City.

If a violation of the National Electrical Safety Code, other applicable regulation, or an otherwise unsafe condition is found to exist by the City, the City will establish a reasonable time for a grantee to make necessary repairs, unless the City determines that the unsafe condition requires immediate resolution which in such case the City can require the grantee to immediately repair or in the absence of the grantee’s availability make the repairs itself. If the repairs are not made within the established time frame or when immediate repair is required, the City may make the repairs itself or have them made and collect all reasonable costs thereof from a grantee. All costs, including administrative costs, incurred by the City in repairing any unsafe conditions shall be borne by grantee and reimbursed to the City. (Ord. 2897 § 2, 2020).

13.24.010 Additional connection charge. 

In addition to the charges for installing the connection and meter, an owner of property fronting on a main for which the property has neither been assessed nor otherwise paid its pro rata share of the cost of the main shall be required to pay the pro-rata share to the City as a condition to the right to connect to the main. The charges may be collected either for the benefit of the City Water System or for private persons who have paid the cost of constructing the main and have entered into a recovery contract with the City. (Ord. 1091 § 5.01, 1971).

Repealed by Ord. 2223. (Ord. 1091 § 5.01(B), 1971). 


13.24.040 Collection – Waiver. 

Where mains have been constructed by or for the City without assessment of abutting property and where a water main extension is proposed to serve abutting property, the City may waive collection of all or part of connecting charges due the City. Such waiver shall be for the purpose of encouraging extensions of the distribution system and may be granted only under the following circumstances: 

A. Waiver shall be granted in any case where a previous recovery contract would prohibit inclusion of the particular frontage in a second recovery contract. 

B. The total length of the proposed extension shall be at least 300 feet or equal to the frontage of the property, on the City’s main, for which waiver is requested, whichever is the greater. 

C. Frontage for which waiver is granted shall include the width of newly platted rights-of-way. 

D. Wherever the tract being subdivided has a corner with frontage on City mains on 2 sides, waiver shall be granted for 100 feet adjacent to such corner unless the tract being subdivided has a lesser dimension in either direction from the corner, which lesser dimension shall prevail. 

E. In order that lots in any new subdivision shall either all be served with water without payment of connection charges or all be subject to payment of connection charges, developers who install water system extensions to serve a new subdivision shall pay the full connection charge for all land platted adjacent to City mains (less amount waived) as a condition to the providing of water service to the extension. (Ord. 1091 § 5.01(C), 1971). 


13.24.050 Connection charge to City-owned mains. 

A. All connection charges for service from water and sewer mains owned by the City installed after January 1, 1972, and not subject to recovery contracts shall be based on the actual construction cost apportioned according to front footage or any other equitable method of apportionment. These charges are declared to represent a fair pro rata share of the cost of construction of a main with appurtenances, without regard to the actual size of mains constructed. 

B. Where the City has participated in a project financed by the method of “Cash Contributions,” the connection charge shall be the fair share of the actual construction costs. The connection charges shall not apply to premises which: 

1. Have been previously connected without payment of connection charges; 

2. Are served by mains constructed for the purpose of serving the premises and donated to the City; or 

3. Are situated on property for which connection charges have been previously paid. (Ord. 1901 § 1, 1991; Ord. 1091 § 5.01(D), 1971). 


13.24.060 Connection charge for partial water line extensions. 

Under special circumstances, such as at pressure zone separations, the City may permit only a portion of a water extension to be constructed. In such cases, the developer shall deposit a sum of money calculated at a rate established under IMC 13.24.050 for the portion of frontage not covered by the extension but required to be covered under IMC 13.12.010 and 13.16.030. The sum shall be used by the City to pay the developer’s portion of a future extension past the frontage not covered by the partial extension. No refund shall be made if the owner’s fair share of the cost is less than the payment to the City; neither shall the City claim any additional amount due if it incurs a greater cost for construction. (Ord. 1091 § 5.01(E), 1971). 


13.24.070 Hydrant charges. 

A. Fire Districts. Any fire district having fire hydrants served by the City Water System shall pay the City the sum of $5.00 per annum for each fire hydrant served. The charge is to cover the City’s annual cost of maintaining the hydrants and valves and providing water adequate for fire protection. It is understood that no fire district shall begin paying the sum until such time as the fire district has the service of a fire truck. It also understood that fire district crews shall use discretion in the use of water and the handling of fire hydrants during fire drills. A district will be notified no later than July 31st of the current year as to the number of hydrants within the district for which the $5.00 fee will be charged for the following year. 

B. Private Fire Protection, Automatic Sprinkler System, Wet or Dry Standpipes. The rates for water supplied for fire protection of standby service, exclusively, shall be deemed service charges and shall be, for any 1 month or fractional part thereof, equal to the minimum monthly residential charge. (Ord. 1091 § 5.02, 1971).


13.24.080 Service installation fees. 

A. No service installation fee shall be levied against any building in which there is an existing water service, including meter and meter box, which was installed by a developer or other agency and meets the requirements of this Code as to location and materials used. 

B. Fees for installation of water meters shall be listed in the current Public Works Department Schedule of Charges. These fees shall be paid in cash prior to connection to a City water main and shall include the cost of connection, water meter, meter box, fittings, and shut-off valves. Pressure-reducing devices and check valves shall not be included, but shall be installed, when required, by the customer in his system within the property served. Fixed fees shall include up to 60 feet of service line, beyond which the cost of materials and labor shall be separately billed. (Ord. 1391 § 1, 1979; Ord. 1262 § 1, 1977; Ord. 1091 § 5.03, 1971).


13.24.090 General facility charge and regional capital facilities charges – Water. 

A. Beginning August 19, 1996, and thereafter in addition to other fees imposed by ordinance or pursuant to agreements, there is imposed upon the owners of property seeking to provide water service to their property by connecting to the City’s water system a general facility charge. The charge shall be in accordance with the schedule of charges contained in this section entitled “Water General Facility Charge”; provided, however, if a meter larger than what is required for domestic use is installed for fire protection needs, the calculated charge (regional capital facilities and City facilities) shall be the actual meter size minus 1 size increment, unless sufficient and complete documentation is provided to substantiate that a smaller meter size would have been used in the absence of fire protection needs, as set forth in this section.

In situations where there is an existing meter being replaced by 1 of equal or greater size, a credit in an amount previously paid for the “water general facility charge” (City facilities and/or regional capital facilities charges) for the existing meter shall be provided, but only if documentation is provided that a “water general facility charge” (City facilities and/or regional capital facilities charges) was paid when the existing meter was installed. Under no circumstance will credit be provided for:

1. Meters installed prior to August 19, 1996, as the City did not have a “water general facility charge” prior to this date; or

2. If sufficient and complete documentation is not provided by the applicant.

B. The general facility charge and Cascade Water Alliance regional capital facilities charges for all new connections to Issaquah’s water utility shall be paid in accordance with the tables below.

C. The City facilities component of the charges in the below tables will be automatically increased each year on January 1st, compared to the prior year, by the percentage reflected in the Seattle ENR Construction Cost Index (CCI), based on November of the prior year to November of the current year. No change to the City facilities charges will be made if the percent charge in the CCI is less than or equal to 0.

13.28.115 Source control best management practices.

A. Source Control BMP Requirements. Source control requirements are contained in the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Manual, which is also identified as Volume IV of the adopted 2014 Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington.

B. BMP Requirements.

1. The SPP Manual provides information on source control pollution prevention best management practices (BMPs) for commercial, industrial, multifamily residential, single-family residential, and public sites that shall be implemented in accordance with this chapter to reduce the contamination of stormwater, surface water, and groundwater.

2. All proposals for new development and redevelopment shall include source control pollution prevention BMPs as required by the Stormwater Design Manual and the SPP Manual.

3. In applying the SPP Manual to prohibited discharges from normal single-family residential activities, the Director shall use public education and technical assistance as the primary method of gaining compliance with this chapter. Enforcement action will be used if the Director determines:

a. The discharge from a normal single-family residential activity, whether singly or in combination with other discharges, is causing a significant contribution of contaminants to surface and stormwater or groundwater; or

b. The discharge from a normal single-family residential activity poses a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, endangers any property or adversely affects the safety and operation of City right-of-way, utilities, or other City-owned or maintained property.

4. In applying the source control BMPs to prohibited discharges from existing commercial, industrial, multifamily and public sites, the City may require the application of operational or structural source control BMPs at any time through formal code enforcement for pollutant generating sources associated with existing land uses and activities where necessary to prevent illicit discharges. Failure to comply shall result in enforcement action in accordance with Chapter 1.36 IMC.

C. Exemptions.

1. Persons implementing BMPs through another approved Federal, State, or local program will not be required to implement the BMPs prescribed in the SPP Manual, unless the Director determines that the other program’s BMPs are ineffective at minimizing the discharge of contaminants. If the other program requires the development of a stormwater pollution prevention plan, the person shall make their plan available to the City upon request. Persons who qualify for exemptions include, but are not limited to, persons who:

a. Have obtained and are complying with a general or individual permit under the NPDES Stormwater Permit Program from the Washington State Department of Ecology;

b. Are a public facility implementing BMPs in compliance with the stormwater management program of an NPDES municipal stormwater permit;

c. Are voluntarily implementing other BMPs, which are equivalent measures, methods, or practices to the BMPs in the SPP Manual. (Ord. 2783 § 2 (Exh. A2), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 2 (Exh. A1), 2009; Ord. 2288 § 2, 2000).


13.28.120 Hazards.

Whenever the Director determines that any existing construction site, erosion and sedimentation problem, developed parcel with runoff containing contaminants, and/or drainage facility poses a hazard to life and limb, endangers any property, endangers the health of aquatic life and/or habitat, and/or adversely affects the condition or capacity of other drainage facilities, the safety and operation of public right-of-way, utilities, waters of the State, and/or other property owned or maintained by the City, the applicant/person to whom the permit was issued pursuant to IMC 13.28.030, the owner of the property within which the drainage facility is located, the applicant/person responsible for maintenance of the facility, and/or other person or agent in control of said property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the Director shall within the period specified therein repair or otherwise address the cause of the hazardous situation in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.

Should the Director have reasonable cause to believe that the situation is so adverse as to preclude written notice, the Director may take the measures necessary to eliminate the hazardous situation; provided, that the Director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner before acting. In such instances the applicant of whom a drainage plan was required pursuant to IMC 13.28.030, the owner of the property and/or the person responsible for the maintenance of the facility shall be obligated for the payment of all costs incurred. If costs are incurred and a financial guarantee pursuant to this chapter or other City requirement has been posted, the Director shall have the authority to collect against the financial guarantee to cover costs incurred. (Ord. 2783 § 2 (Exh. A2), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 2 (Exh. A1), 2009; Ord. 2288 § 2, 2000).

13.30.010 Stormwater Management Utility created – Responsibilities. 

There is hereby created and established pursuant to Chapters 35A.80 and 35.67 RCW, a storm and surface water utility to be known as the Stormwater Management Utility. All references to the “Utility” in this chapter refer to the Stormwater Management Utility. The Utility will have primary authority and responsibility for carrying out the City’s comprehensive drainage and storm sewer plan, maintenance, administration, and operation of all City storm and surface water facilities, as well as establishing standards for design, construction, and maintenance of improvements on private property where these may affect storm and surface water and management. (Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.020 Administrator of utility. 

The Director of Public Works shall be the administrator of the Utility. (Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.030 Ownership of City stormwater facilities and assets. 

Title and all other incidents of ownership of the following assets are vested in the Utility: 

A. All properties, interests, and physical and intangible rights of every nature owned or held by the City, however acquired, insofar as they relate to or concern storm or surface water runoff. 

B. All properties, interests and rights acquired by adverse possession or by prescription directly or through another in and to the drainage or storage, or both, of storm or surface waters, or both, through, under or over lands, watercourses, sloughs, streams, ponds, lakes, and swamps. The properties, interests and rights so transferred shall begin from a point where storm or surface waters first enter the storm and surface water system of the City and shall end at a point where the storm or surface waters exit from the storm and surface water system of the City. The width of the properties, interests and rights so transferred shall be to the full extent of inundation caused by storm or flood conditions. 

C. All funds on deposit in the City Storm Drainage Fund and future revenues of said fund. (Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.040 Definitions. 

A. “Developed parcel” means any parcel altered from the natural state by construction, creation, or addition of impervious surfaces. Parcels with more than 1,440 square feet of impervious surface area (i.e., more than one-half ESU), or those that meet the definition of residential, shall be considered developed.

B. “ESU (equivalent service unit)” means the average amount of impervious surface area for residential parcels in Issaquah. One ESU is equal to 2,000 square feet of impervious surface area. All developed residential parcels are assigned an ESU of 1.0. The ESU for a nonresidential parcel is calculated by dividing the total impervious surface area of that parcel by 2,000.

C. “Impervious surface” means a hard surface area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle as under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, roofs, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, areas which are paved, graveled or made of packed or oiled earthen materials, dirt or gravel roads and parking lots subject to regular vehicular traffic, or other nonvegetated surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of surface and stormwater. Open uncovered flow control or water quality treatment facilities, cleared areas of mining facilities not subject to compaction by vehicles or equipment, and temporarily cleared areas at permitted development sites shall not be considered as impervious surfaces. For new development, a state of impervious condition begins upon completion of the building foundation phase of construction.

D. “Maintenance” means the act or process of cleaning, repairing or preserving a system, unit, facility, structure or piece of equipment. 

E. “Open space” means any parcel, property, or portion thereof classified for current use taxation under the provisions of Chapter 84.34 RCW, or for which the development rights have been sold to the City of Issaquah. 

F. “Parcel” means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries and surface area which is documented for property tax purposes and given a tax number by the King County assessor. 

G. “Rate category” means the classification in this chapter given to a parcel in the service area based upon the type of land use on the parcel and the percentage of impervious surface area contained on the parcel. 

H. “Residence” means a building or structure, or portion thereof, designed for and used to provide a place of abode for human beings. The term residence includes the term “residential” or “residential unit” as referring to the type of or intended use of a building or structure. 

I. “Residential parcel” means any parcel which contains no more than 2 residences or 2 residential units which are within a single structure and are used primarily for residential purposes or any parcel which does not have impervious surfaces upon it. 

J. “Surface and stormwater utility services” means the services provided by the Stormwater Utility, including, but not limited to, stormwater management planning, facilities maintenance, regulation, financial administration, public involvement, drainage investigation and enforcement, aquatic resource restoration, surface and stormwater quality and environmental monitoring, natural surface water drainage system planning, intergovernmental relations, and facility design and construction. 

K. “Undeveloped parcel” means any parcel which has not been altered from its natural state by construction, creation or addition of impervious surfaces. Nonresidential parcels with less than 1,440 square feet of impervious surface area (i.e., less than one-half ESU) shall be considered undeveloped. (Ord. 2419 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2343 § 1, 2002; Ord. 2335 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1955 § 1, 1992; Ord. 1941 § 1, 1992; Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.050 Rates for surface water drainage service. 

A. The service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the surface and stormwater management system. The percentage of impervious surfaces on the parcel and the total parcel acreage will be used to indicate the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from the parcel to the surface and stormwater management system. The relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from each parcel will determine that parcel’s share of the service charge revenue needs. The service charge revenue needs of the program are based upon all or any part, as determined by the Council, of the cost of surface and stormwater management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such purpose. 

B. The Public Works Department shall determine the service charge for each parcel within the service area based on percent impervious surface. Aerial photographic mapping, ortho-rectified aerial photographs (orthophotos), as-built drawings, and parcel boundaries obtained from the King County Department of Assessments (or other appropriate data) will be used to determine each parcel’s percentage of impervious surface coverage. 

C. Stormwater utility charges shall be in accordance with the schedule contained in this section entitled “Stormwater Utility Rates.” For residential and undeveloped parcels, the service charge is a flat rate per parcel. For non residential parcels, the service charge shall be computed as the product of the applicable rate times the number of ESUs (rate x ESU) present on that parcel. All developed parcels shall be charged a minimum of 1.0 ESU. Small undeveloped parcels with total area less than 5,000 square feet, total assessed value less than or equal to $10,000, and impervious surface area less than 0.5 ESU shall be considered exempt from stormwater fees.

D. The City Council will review the surface water utility service charges annually to ensure the long-term fiscal viability of the program and to guarantee that debt covenants are met. The program will use equitable and efficient methods to determine service charges. 

E. Because all real property in the City contributes drainage runoff to and/or benefits from the City’s surface water drainage system, the owners thereof shall pay stormwater utility charges as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2749 § 1, 2015; Ord. 2527 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2470 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2419 § 2, 2005; Ord. 2343 § 2, 2002; Ord. 2335 §§ 2, 3, 2002; Ord. 2248 § 1, 1999; Ord. 2210 §§ 1, 2, 1998; Ord. 2171 §§ 1, 2, 1997; Ord. 2157 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1955 §§ 2, 3, 1992; Ord. 1941 § 2, 1992; Ord. 1885 § 1, 1991; Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988).


13.30.055 General facilities charge – Stormwater.

A. Beginning on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, and thereafter in addition to other fees required by ordinance or pursuant to agreement, there is imposed upon the owner of property seeking to connect to the City’s stormwater system a general facility charge. This general facility charge is determined as $1,457 times the number of equivalent service units (ESU) ($1,457 x ESU). This general facility charge will be automatically increased each year on January 1st, compared to the prior year by the percentage reflected in the Seattle ENR Construction Cost Index (CCI), based on November of the prior year to November of the current year. No change to the general facility charge will be made if the percent charge in the CCI is less than or equal to 0.

B. The general facility charge shall be paid and collected at the time of permit issuance for development and prior to actual development. 

C. Applicants for development shall be required to pay the stormwater general facility charge in effect at the time the permit is issued. (Ord. 2890 § 1, 2019; Ord. 2749 § 3, 2015; Ord. 2470 § 2, 2006; Ord. 2335 § 4, 2002).


13.30.060 Billing. 

A. The charges imposed by this chapter shall be billed in conjunction with the property owner’s customary water and sanitary sewer bill issued by the City. Such charges shall be due and payable as provided herein. In the event a property does not have water or sanitary sewer service, or if the water and sanitary sewer service charge is billed to a tenant, but is subject to the charges imposed herein, a new account shall be established and the property owner shall be billed separately for the surface water drainage service charges.

B. The City will collect the stormwater utility fees on a bimonthly schedule. 

1. All parcels subject to charges of the utility shall be billed on the property characteristics existing on the most currently available mapping information for the parcel and at a rate set forth in this chapter. Billing year is the year that the bills are sent. 

2. The charges imposed by this chapter shall be billed in conjunction with the property or user’s customary water and sanitary sewer bill issued by the City. Such charges shall be due and payable as provided herein. In the event a property does not have water or sanitary sewer service but is subject to the charges imposed herein, a new account shall be established and that property shall be billed separately for the surface water drainage service charges. (Ord. 2335 §§ 5, 6, 2002; Ord. 1955 §§ 4, 5, 1992; Ord. 1941 § 3, 1992; Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.070 Credits allowed. 

A. Any person billed for service charges may file a “Request for Rate Adjustment” with the Public Works Department within 2 years of the date from which the bill was sent. However, filing of such a request does not extend the period for payment of the charge. 

B. Requests for rate adjustment may be granted or approved by the Director only when one of the following conditions exists:

1. The parcel is owned and is the personal residence of a person or persons qualified as a low income senior citizen as described in Chapter 13.92 IMC.

2. The acreage of the parcel charged is in error.

3. The parcel is nonresidential and the actual impervious surface coverage of the parcel results in more than a 0.10-unit change in ESU, or places it in a different rate category than the rate category assigned by the Director.

4. The parcel is owned or leased by a public school district which provides activities which directly benefit the City’s surface water utility. The activities may include curriculum specific to the issues and problems of surface and stormwater management, and student activities in the community to expose students to the efforts required to restore, monitor or enhance the surface and stormwater management system. Pursuant to RCW 36.89.085, the amount of the rate adjustment shall be determined by the Director based upon the cost of the activities to the school district but not to exceed the value of the activity to the surface water utility. Determination of which activities qualify for the surface water utility service charge reduction will be made by the Public Works Department. Reductions in surface water utility charges will only be granted to school district which provide programs that have been evaluated by the Public Works Department. The rate adjustment for the school district activity may be applied to any parcel in the service area which is owned or operated by the school district.

5. The utility charge bill was otherwise not calculated in accordance with the terms of this chapter.

6. Parcels that meet the following criteria are exempt from the stormwater service charge:

a. Open space parcels, including privately owned parcels designated as native growth protection easements in their entirety, and publicly owned parcels zoned as Community Facilities – Open Space or Lake Tradition – Natural Resource Conservation Area.

b. Residential parcels that are permanently undevelopable due to Federal Emergency Management Agency regulatory floodway designation and associated development restrictions.

c. Residential parcels that are undevelopable due to critical area designations, such as streams and wetlands and their buffers.

d. Small undeveloped parcels with total assessed value less than or equal to $20,000 and impervious surface area less than 0.5 ESU.

e. Nondeeded public lands, such as stream corridors and water bodies, except street right-of-way.

f. Utility parcels that contain stormwater detention/retention ponds as the primary use.

g. All City road rights-of-way.

h. All State highway rights-of-way.

7. Parcels that meet the following criteria can receive a reduction in the stormwater service charge:

a. Developed parcels that infiltrate runoff in a private site stormwater infiltration facility may receive the following service charge discount: 

	Design Storm	Discount

	100-year	50%

	50-year	40%

	10-year	30%

A Technical Information Report prepared by a licensed professional engineer shall be provided to document the engineering design of the facility based on King County Surface Water Design Manual KCRTS (or equivalent) modeling methods. Surface water discharges to streams for base flow augmentation benefit shall be considered part of the infiltration quantity. The City may require field tests or monitoring data to verify that the as-built facility achieves the design storm performance. Infiltration facilities that serve portions of a site, such as rooftops only, may receive a pro rata discount based on the drainage area being infiltrated. Parcels that apply for this exemption must pass inspection pursuant to IMC 13.28.090. This exemption shall be revoked and fee reinstated for up to 3 years of past utility billings if property owner fails to conduct required maintenance or it is determined that the facility does not fully perform to the original infiltration standard.

b. City streets, including public rights-of-way, parcels dedicated to the City for rights-of-way but remaining as separate tax parcels, City-owned parcels adjacent to rights-of-way and maintained as part of the City street, and former railroad rights-of-way converted to trail use may receive a 70 percent discount.

8. Appeal of Impervious Surface Definition. If the property owner feels that the City erred in classifying a portion of the parcel’s land area as impervious surface, because of how the definition of impervious surface was interpreted, the landowner may submit test data or other information that shows that the land area in question is in fact pervious. Infiltration tests or other appropriate methods certified by a professional engineer or geologist shall be used to verify that actual infiltration rates for the soil meets the infiltration definition for the soil classification that was mapped at the site prior to development (as shown on King County Soil Survey maps or other verifiable soil survey). Such tests must be made on undisturbed surface soils that are representative of the land use being disputed.

9. New stormwater utility accounts that were established in 2002, but subsequently qualified for exemption in accordance with the criteria in subsection (B)(6) of this section, are eligible for refund of 2002 stormwater utility charges and late fees on that account.



C. The property owner shall have the burden of proving that the rate adjustment sought should be granted. 

D. Decisions on requests for rate adjustments shall be made by the Director based on information submitted by the applicant and by the Public Works Department within 30 days of the adjustment request except when additional information is needed. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the Director’s decision. If an adjustment is granted which reduces the charge for the current year or up to 3 prior years, the applicant shall be refunded the amount overpaid in the current and up to 3 prior years.

E. If the Director finds that a parcel of land has not previously been charged or previously charged in error (e.g., data entry error), and it is legally defensible, then an amended bill shall be issued which includes the undercharged amount for up to the previous three years. This amended bill shall be due and payable as provided in RCW 36.89.090, 36.89.092 and 35.67.200, at the rate of 12 percent per annum, or such rate as may hereafter be authorized by law, computed on a monthly basis from the date of delinquency until paid. (Ord. 2470 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2419 § 3, 2005; Ord. 2343 § 3, 2002; Ord. 2335 §§ 7, 8, 9, 2002; Ord. 1941 § 4, 1992; Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.090 Remedies. 

In the event a customer or property owner shall fail to pay the surface water drainage service charge, the City shall have the authority to terminate domestic water service to said property or customer. Termination of such water service shall not limit other remedies available to the City under state law. (Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.100 Appeals. 

Any customer or property owner who feels that the surface water drainage service charge for their property has been incorrectly computed or applied, and/or that credits have not been properly granted may petition, in writing to the Director for a review of said computations, application or credit.

If not satisfied with the determination of the Director, the petitioner may appeal to the City Council in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1.32 IMC. Any credits authorized by the appeal process shall only be effective against billings subsequent to the date the appeal is filed. (Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988). 


13.30.110 Accounts – Billing and delinquency.

A. It shall be the duty of the Finance Director to keep accounts with all users of stormwater service, to enter on such accounts all charges and penalties, and provide regular billing to all users. All bills shall be sent to the owners of record, except when the tenant appears at the City Hall and signs a notarized statement accepting responsibility for payment.

B. An account shall be deemed delinquent if not paid within 30 days of the due date. Delinquent accounts shall be subject to a 10 percent service charge. There shall be a further 10 percent service charge for each additional 2 months of delinquency.

C. All charges for stormwater service, when the same becomes delinquent and unpaid, shall be a lien against the premises to which the service has been furnished. (Ord. 2527 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2470 § 4, 2006; Ord. 1791 § 1, 1988).

A. In addition to other fees required by ordinance or pursuant to agreement, there is imposed upon the owners of property seeking to connect to the City’s sewer system a general facility charge. This general facility charge is determined by $2,124 times the number of METRO residential customer equivalents (RCE) ($2,124 x RCE). One RCE is equal to 750 cubic feet of usage per month (METRO’s assumed average winter usage for a single-family residence). This general facility charge will be automatically increased each year on January 1st, compared to the prior year by the percentage reflected in the Seattle ENR Construction Cost Index (CCI), based on November of the prior year to November of the current year. No change to the general facility charge will be made if the percent charge in the CCI is less than or equal to 0.

1. The general facility charge shall be paid and collected at the time of permit issuance for development and prior to actual development.

Any special or general deposit made under these provisions shall serve as security for the repair of underground utilities or other maintenance or services required of the City as a consequence of the permit holder’s activity. Upon the permittee’s completion of the work covered by such permit in conformity with the IMC as determined by the City Engineer, such cash deposit, except in the case of an annual deposit, shall be promptly refunded by the City to the permittee.

C. Permit fees are as defined in IMC 3.65.040.

D. An administrative fee of $75.00 shall accompany each request for a waiver applied for under the provisions of IMC 13.80.040. (Ord. 2186 § 2, 1998).

A. In addition to the permit fees, deposits, general facility charges, and utility rates, the applicant for a side sewer permit for property fronting on a sewer line for which the property has neither been assessed nor otherwise paid its pro rata share of the cost of the sewer line shall be required to pay the pro rata share to the City as a condition to the right to connect to the line. The construction assessment may be collected either for the benefit of the City Sewer System or for private persons who have paid the cost of constructing the sewer line and have entered into a recovery contract with the City.

B. When connecting to a main constructed before October 1, 1978, the applicant shall pay an assessment of $3.00 per lineal foot of main along that side of the property that the connection is made.

C. When connecting to a main constructed after October 1, 1978, the applicant shall pay an amount based on the methodology outlined in IMC 13.70.070.

D. When connecting to an existing sewer main which does not completely or at all front the property, the owner/applicant shall pay an amount based on the methodology outlined in IMC 13.70.070.

E. When the property is subject to a recovery contract, the applicant shall pay the assessment identified in such contract. There shall be included in an engineer’s estimate on any such sewer improvement, separately itemized, and in such assessments, a sum equal to the amount provided in or computed from such contract as the fair pro rata share due from such owners upon and for such contracted sewer facilities. Recovery contracts shall determine the fair pro rata cost share due using the methodology outlined in IMC 13.70.070.

F. Construction assessments shall not apply to those parcels which:

1. Previously connected without paying the assessment;

2. Are served by a sewer main constructed for the purpose of serving the parcel and subsequently donated (i.e., as part of a plat) to the City; or

3. Construction assessments have previously been paid.

G. The City shall not waive any collections required by a recovery contract and shall exercise reasonable vigilance to assure that payment of fair shares is not evaded. The City may, however, authorize the connection of additional lines to the sewer lines subject to a recovery contract without payment of pro rata shares; provided the additional sewer lines are to be constructed in a public right-of-way existing at the date of acceptance of the recovery contract, or provided the additional mains connect to the terminus of the recovery contract sewer line. In the event such additional mains are intended to provide sewer service to any tract fronting the sewer line already subject to contract, the owner of the additional mains shall be required to pay the pro rata share for such tract. If, as a result of the existence of 2 or more sewer lines under separate recovery contract, any property may be reasonably served from more than 1 sewer line, the owner of the property may choose to be connected to a particular sewer line and the pro rata share will be collected under that contract only. (Ord. 2186 § 2, 1998).


13.70.070 Determination of construction assessment.

A. Commercial Property. The pro rata cost share shall be assessed to parcels based on the total cost including engineering, construction, and legal fees associated with the sewer main and the percent of the total capacity in the subject sewer main utilized by development on the assessed parcel or any other equitable method of apportionment.

B. Residential Property. The pro rata cost share shall be assessed to parcels based on the total cost including engineering, construction, and legal fees associated with the sewer main and the number of equivalent residential units the main will provide service for based on the zoning at the time of construction or any other equitable method of apportionment. The assessment shall be a dollar amount per equivalent residential unit.

C. Inadequate Frontage. The pro rata cost share will be estimated as appropriate for either commercial or residential property using estimated costs to extend the sewer main. Additionally, the property owner will be required to sign a no protest agreement for the formation of a utility limited improvement district (ULID). (Ord. 2186 § 2, 1998).


13.70.080 Recording fees.

All recording fees shall be paid for by the owner or owners of the properties affected. (Ord. 2186 § 2, 1998).


13.70.090 Recovery contracts.

13.90.040 Recommendation of cost recovery benefit area.

After the application is filed, the Public Works Director shall recommend the boundaries of the cost recovery benefit area based upon a determination of which parcels do not contribute to the original cost of the water or sewer facilities for which the recovery contract applies and which may subsequently tap into or use the same, including not only those which may connect directly thereto, but also those which may connect to laterals or branches connecting thereto. (Ord. 2852 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2223 § 2, 1999).

7. Verification and approval of all contracts and costs related to the water or sewer facilities.

B. Each cost recovery contract shall provide for a pro rata reimbursement to the applicant or the applicant’s assigns for 20 years from the date the contract is executed. The reimbursement must be (1) within the period of time that the cost recovery contract is effective; (2) for a portion of the costs of the water or sewer facilities improved or constructed in accordance with the contract; and (3) from cost recovery fees received by the City from property owners who subsequently connect to or use the water or sewer facilities, but who did not contribute to the original cost of the facilities.

C. Each cost recovery contract shall include a requirement that every 2 years from the date the contract is executed a property owner entitled to reimbursement under the contract must update the City with information regarding the current contact name, address, and telephone number of the person, company, or partnership that originally entered into the contract. If the property owner fails to comply with the notification requirements of this subsection within 60 days of the specified time, then the City may collect any reimbursement or recovery funds owed to the property owner under the contract. The funds collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the capital improvement fund of the utility owning the improvement and will be immediately available for use by the City on improvements funded by the said capital improvement fund.

D. The cost recovery contract shall provide that the City is authorized to make segregation or adjustment of cost recovery fees based on subdivision or boundary line adjustments of the benefitted properties. The segregation or adjustment shall generally be made in accordance with the method used to establish the original cost recovery fees. Segregation or adjustment shall not increase or decrease the total cost recovery fees to be paid.

E. The standard cost recovery contract titled, Latecomer Agreement for Water and Sewer Utility Improvements, November 1, 2018, version, is hereby attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full. This contract shall be used unless otherwise approved by the City Council.

Written notice of the hearing shall be given by mail to the applicant and to the owners of all properties within the cost recovery benefit area, as listed on the rolls of the King County Assessor, at least 10 days in advance of the hearing. The notice shall indicate the tax parcel number of each parcel within the cost recovery benefit area and the amount of the proposed proportionate share of the cost of the improvement to be paid for the parcel. Upon completion of the public hearing, the City Council shall make a final determination on the boundaries of the cost recovery benefit area and the proportionate shares to be paid by each parcel and shall approve the applicant’s request for a cost recovery contract if the Council determines that (A) the City’s ordinances require the water or sewer facilities to be improved or constructed as a prerequisite for development of the parcels in the proposed cost recovery benefit area; and (B) the water or sewer facilities are consistent with all applicable comprehensive plan provisions and development regulations of the City. The decision of the City Council shall be final and not subject to further appeal. (Ord. 2852 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2223 § 2, 1999).

Within 120 days after completion of construction, the applicant shall request final acceptance of the improvements by the City, subject to the required warranty or maintenance period specified in the cost recovery contract. At the time final acceptance is requested, the applicant shall submit the total cost of the water or sewer facilities to the City. In the event that actual costs differ from the Public Works Director’s initial estimate used in calculating the recovery fee, the Director shall recalculate the recovery fees, and shall cause a revised list of fees to be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections, at the applicant’s cost. (Ord. 2852 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2223 § 2, 1999).


13.90.100 Collection of recovery fees.

A. Subsequent to the recording of a recovery contract and for a period of 20 years from the date the contract is executed, the City shall not permit connection of any property within the benefit area of any sewer or water facility constructed pursuant to the recovery contract unless the share of the cost of such facility as required by the recorded agreement is first paid to the City.

B. Upon receipt of any such fees, the City shall deduct an administrative fee of $300.00 as set forth in the cost recovery contract and remit the balance to the party entitled to the fee pursuant to the agreement. In the event that through error the City fails to collect a required recovery fee prior to approval of connection to a sewer or water facility, the City shall make diligent efforts to collect such fee, but shall under no circumstances be obligated to make payment to the party entitled to reimbursement or in any way be liable to such party, unless such recovery fee has actually been paid to the City.

109.4 Registered plan program. The City has established a registered plan program, the purpose of which is to allow for an expedited review process for plans that are intended to remain unchanged but used multiple times. Options are allowed to be submitted with the initial registering of the basic plan to accommodate a variation of building styles using the basic plan. When plans are submitted under the City’s “registered plan program,” a plan review fee shall be paid at the time of application for a registered plan. The Building Official may have the option to charge a partial deposit in lieu of the full plan review fee. All portions of fees paid as a deposit amount shall be applied to the total plan review fees owed. The applicant shall be required to pay the balance of the amount owed for the plan review.

Valuations used to compute the permit fees shall include all options submitted with a registered plan. When a registered plan consists of a number of plan options that can produce any number of similar but different buildings, the Building Official may charge plan review fees based on each different building configuration. Plan review fees shall be paid for at the time of application for a building permit. The Building Official may have the option to charge a partial deposit in lieu of the full plan review fee. All portions of fees paid as a deposit amount shall be applied to the total plan review fees owed. The applicant shall be required to pay the balance of the amount owed for the plan review. The plan review fees specified in this subsection are separate fees from the permit fees and are in addition to the permit fees.

Plan Orientation: Building construction shall follow the direction, layout and orientation of the plan as approved. Reversed or flipped plans shall not be allowed for submittal.

Revisions: Once a plan and associated options are reviewed, approved and registered, changes or revisions to that plan are not permitted without requiring the plan to be resubmitted as a new registered plan and pay full new fees.

Field Revision: Once a permit is issued for a registered plan, no revisions will be permitted except for minor field changes per Field Inspection Policy 03-001. Changes other than minor field changes will be considered major changes and require the permit holder to resubmit those changes as a new submittal and pay a fee.

109.5 Building permit valuations. The applicant for a permit shall provide an estimated permit value at the time of application. The determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions of this code shall be made by the Building Official. The Building Valuation Data published by the International Code Council in effect as of February of each year shall be used to determine building valuations for the various building types and occupancies noted in the Square Foot Construction Costs table and shall be effective in the City the following March 31st. The valuation for decks, platforms, stairs and porches shall be determined using the valuation in the Square Foot Construction Costs table for Unfinished Basements for Group R-3 Occupancies in the Building Valuation Data. Regional modifiers shall not be applicable. 

When a specific building type or occupancy is not noted in the valuation table, the Building Official is authorized to use any of the classification types noted in the table that most closely resembles the proposed type of building or determine a valuation type independently. For tenant improvements, remodels, modifications, or similar work, the valuation shall be based on the scope of work and shall be in addition to new construction applicable to a permit. The valuation shall include the cost of all building, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical work. The Building Official may require a contractor’s bid to justify any submitted valuations. Final determinations shall be made by the Building Official. The Building Official is authorized to subtract or modify the valuation of certain specialty equipment if, by the sole discretion of the Building Official, including such equipment would cause the permit cost to be unnecessarily excessive.

When valuations are provided with the permit application and determined by a registered design professional, if the valuation is higher than what is determined by the method noted in this section, the higher valuation shall apply. If the valuation provided by a registered design professional is lower than what is determined by the method noted in this section, the higher valuation shall apply.

109.6 Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits shall be subject to a special investigation fee. The special investigation fee shall be in addition to the required permit fees.

109.7 Refunds. The Building Official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this chapter. The Building Official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or cancelled before any plan review is done. The Building Official shall not authorize refunding of any fee paid except on written application filed by the original permittee and not later than 180 days after the date the fee was paid.

Prior approval of a public safety radio coverage system on previous frequencies does not exempt this requirement.

510.5.3 Acceptance Test procedure. Acceptance testing for Emergency responder radio amplification system is required, upon completion of installation. It is the building owner’s responsibility to have the radio system tested by qualified personnel to ensure a minimum of 95% two-way coverage on each floor of the building.

A report shall be submitted to the Fire Marshal at the conclusion of acceptance testing containing a floor plan and the signal strengths at each location tested and other relevant information. A representative of the Fire Marshal’s Office may oversee the acceptance test. Acceptance testing is also required whenever changes occur to the building that would materially change the original field performance test. The test procedure shall be conducted as follows:

1. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately forty (40) equal areas.

2. Testing shall use a two (2) watt, portable transceiver with speaker/microphone and flexible antenna (or any calibrated device which will produce signal levels useable by the prescribed portable radio). Field strength testing instruments must have been calibrated within one (1) year of the date of the acceptance test. Field strength testing instruments must be of the frequency selective type incorporating a flexible antenna similar to the ones used on the hand held transceivers. City Radio System Manager may designate alternate methods of measuring the signal level, which satisfy appropriate levels of public safety coverage.

3. A maximum of two (2) nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test.

4. In the event that three (3) of the areas fail the test, the floor may be divided into eighty (80) equal areas in order to be more statistically accurate. In such event, a maximum of four (4) nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the eighty (80) area tests, if the system continues to fail, the building owner shall have the system altered to meet the 95% coverage requirement.

5. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communication to and from the outside of the building through the Regional 800 MHz Radio System. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within the grid area is not permitted. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the results kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

6. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

7. As part of the installation a spectrum analyzer or other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are not being generated by the subject signal booster. This test shall be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections.

510.5.5 Approval Prior to Occupancy. A Certificate of Occupancy will not be issued to any structure if the building fails to comply with Section 510.

510.6 Maintenance. The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be maintained operational at all times in accordance with Sections 510.6.1 through 510.6.3.

Testing shall consist of the following:

1. In-building coverage test as described in Section 510.5.3.

Exception: Group R Occupancy annual testing is not required within dwelling units.

2. Signal boosters shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance.

3. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of 1 hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the 1-hour test period the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional 1-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined.

4. All other active components shall be checked to verify operation within the manufacturer’s specifications.

5. At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify compliance with Section 510.5.3, shall be submitted to the fire code official.

510.6.2 Identification. Radio Coverage system shall be identified by a sign located on or near the Fire Alarm Control Panel stating “This building is equipped with an Emergency Responder Radio Coverage System.”

510.6.3 Field Testing. Police and Fire Personnel shall at any time have the right to enter onto the property to conduct its own field-testing to be certain that the required level of radio coverage is present.

16.26.010 Purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is to promote, protect and preserve the public interest by regulating land alteration, particularly the clearing and grading of land and stormwater runoff impacts of land development in the City. This chapter is necessary in order to provide development regulations and construction procedures for protecting and preserving the natural qualities of lands and watercourses within the City; to minimize water quality degradation and the sedimentation of creeks, streams, ponds, lakes, wetlands and other water bodies; to minimize the impact of increased runoff, erosion and sedimentation caused by land development and maintenance practices; to preserve and enhance, to maintain and protect groundwater resources; to minimize adverse effects of alterations in ground and surface water quantities, locations and flow patterns; to promote safety upon City roads and rights-of-way; to decrease potential landslide, flood and erosion damage to public and private property; and to promote site planning and building practices which are consistent with the City’s natural topographical, vegetation and hydrological features while allowing for the removal of vegetation and grading activities.

This chapter is intended to require that development in environmentally critical areas be accomplished in a manner which protects those areas from damage or degradation.

This chapter is also intended to promote the health, safety and welfare of the public and nothing in this chapter is intended to or shall be deemed to create a duty in the City to protect or promote the interests of any particular person or class of persons. The existence of these regulations or any failure, refusal or omission of the City to enforce any provision in this chapter shall not prevent, supplant or affect the right of any person affected by the clearing and grading operations of another to invoke such private remedies as may be available against each other person. (Ord. 2783 § 3 (Exh. A3), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2009; Ord. 2487 § 1, 2007).

ii. A wall drain must be provided for all walls greater than 4 feet in height as measured from the bottom of the base structural element. Weepholes and filter drains may also be required to address drainage and hydrostatic pressure.

iii. All wall structures over 4 feet in height shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in the latest edition of the International Building Code.

iv. The geotechnical engineer must provide construction monitoring and/or testing as required by the permit conditions, and submit construction inspection reports to the Department for all retaining walls that require design by a geotechnical engineer. For each project, or phase of a project, the geotechnical engineer must provide a final letter or report summarizing the results of the construction monitoring for each wall, verifying that the wall construction meets the geotechnical recommendations and design guidelines. The final letter or report must be submitted to the Department prior to the final inspection.

v. Land use regulations and approvals may also impact wall design.

4. Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control. All land disturbing activities shall make provisions for temporary erosion and sediment control as follows:

a. A temporary erosion and sedimentation control (TESC) plan and associated required documentation shall meet the following requirements:

i. The TESC plan shall be prepared in accordance with, and be based on the best management practices contained in, Minimum Requirement No. 2.

ii. The plan shall clearly indicate the construction sequence for establishment of all erosion control work, both temporary and permanent, for the drier season and wetter winter months.

iii. The plan shall clearly show environmentally critical areas (including streams, wetlands, steep slopes and their respective buffers), native growth protection easements (NGPEs), greenbelt, open areas, or areas of native vegetation within the development site that are not part of the development proposal to be retained, soil preservation areas, and protection of existing trees and root systems during construction.

iv. The TESC plan shall provide a monitoring discharge point to allow turbidity monitoring of water being discharged from the site.

v. For projects other than small sites, as defined in the Stormwater Design Manual, the plan shall be designed by, and carry the seal of, a civil engineer having certified erosion and sediment control lead (CESCL) certification.

vi. Erosion and sedimentation control devices shall be installed prior to initiation of construction activities and maintained by the permittee over the entire duration of the project until all possibility for erosion has passed and permanent vegetation has been established, as determined by the Director.

vii. Clearing and grading may be permitted to continue or to be initiated during the wet season (October 1st through April 30th) only if the Director grants specific approval per subsection (C)(4)(a)(ii) of this section. In determining whether to permit wet season construction, the Director shall consult with DSD engineers and inspectors to determine whether the proposal ensures slope stability and adequately protects receiving waters from increased erosion and sedimentation during construction.

(A) If clearing and grading is prohibited during the wet season, building construction can nonetheless proceed as long as no additional clearing and grading is performed and effective erosion control is in place and effectively maintained.

(B) A wet season TESC plan is required to be submitted to the Development Services Department by September 1st for approval to initiate or continue clearing and grading activity during the upcoming wet season. The Director may grant approval of the wet season TESC plan based on evaluation of site conditions, the nature of the development activity, previous performance of the contractor, and other factors such as slope, soil type, hydrology, and proximity to receiving waters, as well as erosion control measures to prevent turbid runoff from leaving the site during construction.

(C) If wet season clearing and grading is approved by the Director, and the Director subsequently issues a stop work order for insufficient erosion and sedimentation control, the wet season permit for clearing and grading activity may be suspended until the dry season.

(D) When clearing and grading is suspended during the wet season or interrupted at any time of the year due to heavy rain or other reasons, the permittee shall stabilize the site in accordance with the approved TESC plan and maintain erosion control BMPS.

b. The TESC plan shall be designed to prevent, to the maximum extent practicable, the transport of sediment from the site to drainage facilities, surface waters, and adjacent properties. Turbidity in construction runoff at any monitoring point that exceeds 100 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs) at any time up to the 10-year/24-hour storm event, as measured at the City’s rain gauge, is considered a violation of the permit, subject to stop work and enforcement as described in IMC 16.26.150 and 16.26.190.

c. Updates to the TESC plan can be required at any time during the term of the permit if the approved TESC plan is found to be ineffective or construction sequencing or other changed site conditions make it necessary to modify the original TESC plan to make it compliant with the requirements of the Stormwater Design Manual.

d. Permanent erosion control shall be considered and set forth in the original design of the project to provide erosion control following completion of construction.

e. Vegetation shall be restored on those areas of the site disturbed by the land alteration activity which are not covered by permanent impervious surface improvement (e.g., buildings, parking lots, etc.) within 7 days of the completion of grading or clearing, unless seasonal or weather conditions are unfavorable. In this case, temporary erosion control measures shall be installed and maintained until restoration can be completed. The soils shall be stabilized in the area of vegetation restoration prior to that restoration and in compliance with other applicable soil restoration and landscaping requirements for the project.

f. Areas of disturbed soil that include lawn and landscape areas shall meet post-construction soil quality and depth per the Stormwater Design Manual and detailed in IMC 18.12.140(P) and (Q), landscape code.

5. Stormwater Management. All land disturbing activities shall make provisions for drainage and stormwater management facilities as follows:

C. Suspension of Permits. Whenever the Director determines that the act or intended act of clearing, grading, excavation or fill has become or will constitute a hazard to life and limb, or endangers property, or adversely affects the safety, use or stability of a public way, drainage channel, stream or surface water, including siltation and sedimentation therein, the Director shall immediately suspend the clearing and grading permit.

The permittee or other person or agent in control of the property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the Director, shall, within the period specified therein, terminate such clearing, grading, excavation, embankment or fill, or eliminate the same from the development plans, or modify the plans, as may be required so as to eliminate the hazard and be in conformance with the requirements of this code. The permittee shall also be required to take measures to correct damages caused to adjacent or downstream or upstream properties, under the direction of the Director, or if not accomplished in a reasonable period of time, the City shall do so using the security provided as part of the clearing and grading permit under which the work was done. (Ord. 2783 § 3 (Exh. A3), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2009; Ord. 2487 § 1, 2007). 


16.26.180 Notice to proceed authorized. 

After a permittee is granted a permit for clearing, grading, and stormwater management, no work shall commence prior to issuance of a written “notice to proceed” by the Director. Issuance of the notice to proceed shall occur only after expiration of any appeal period, after a preconstruction conference has been held, and after completion of all conditions set forth in the clearing and grading permit required to be completed prior to commencement of work. (Ord. 2783 § 3 (Exh. A3), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2009; Ord. 2487 § 1, 2007).

A. Pursuant to RCW 76.09.060(3)(d), a 6-year moratorium shall apply to all nonforestry development approvals and permits including, but not limited to, building permits and subdivision approvals related to property regulated by a forest practices permit under Chapter 76.09 RCW.

B. Subsection A of this section shall not apply to property when the forest landowner stated their intent to convert the property at the time of forest practices application (RCW 76.09.060), or if the property is cleared in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter.

C. The application for this section is subject to Level 0 review as set forth in IMC 18.04.320. (Ord. 2783 § 3 (Exh. A3), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2009; Ord. 2487 § 1, 2007). 


16.26.190 Enforcement. 

The violation or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter is unlawful. The remedies provided in this section, whether civil or criminal, shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy provided by law.

A. Civil Remedies. Any work or other activities which are within the authority of this chapter performed without a permit or in violation of any lawful order or requirement of the Director is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated in a manner prescribed by the Director. Injunction proceedings or other appropriate action may be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter in order to prevent, enjoin, abate or terminate violations of this chapter or to restore the property to its original conditions, as nearly as practicable.

B. Persons Subject to Penalty. Any person who violates or fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter or who fails to conform to the terms of an approval or order issued by the Director shall be subject to the civil and criminal penalties provided in Chapter 1.36 IMC, Code Enforcement. Each day of continued violation shall be considered a separate violation for purposes of penalty.

C. In addition, any person convicted of a violation(s) of this chapter shall be required to abate any conditions on the subject property in a manner which will achieve full compliance with this chapter and restore any property to its original condition, as nearly as practicable. (Ord. 2783 § 3 (Exh. A3), 2016; Ord. 2560 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2009; Ord. 2487 § 1, 2007).

16.36.010 Findings.

The City Council finds that:

A. Certain areas within the corporate limits of the City, identified herein, are subject to periodic inundation which endangers life, property, health and safety, causes disruption of commerce and governmental services, and creates extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief.

B. These flood losses are caused by the natural flow and ponding of floodwaters and the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood depths and velocities. Buildings that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or protected from flood damage or that otherwise encroach on the natural storage capacity of the floodplain increase the extent of flooding and the amount of flood damage.

C. These regulations are promulgated in order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

1. To protect life and property by preventing the unwise use of flood-prone lands;

2. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

7. To ensure that potential buyers, appraisers, assessors, and others are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;

8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions;

9. To ensure that existing and new homes, businesses and public buildings will qualify for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program; and

10. To ensure that floodplain development permitting complies with all State and Federal laws, including compliance with the Endangered Species Act as required to maintain the City’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.

D. The purposes of this regulation will best be fulfilled by regulations and provisions for:

1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1465 § 1, 1981).


16.36.020 Scope.

A. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any lands and buildings thereon, whether existing or proposed, located within the areas of special flood hazard. These regulations shall apply to the construction, reconstruction, relocation, addition, or substantial improvement of such buildings, in conjunction with a building permit authorized under Chapter 16.04 IMC, Construction Codes, which may include additional requirements for flood-resistant construction under the International Building Code, the International Residential Code, and other applicable requirements, and to land-altering activities involving placement or move of fill or other material that impede the movement and/or storage of floodwater.

B. Exemptions. The following land-altering activities within areas of special flood hazard are not considered to alter the movement and/or storage of floodwater and therefore are exempt from the provisions of this chapter:

1. Clearing of nonnative vegetation and planting of City-approved native vegetation at streamside restoration projects.

2. Temporary placement of sand bags for flood protection purposes, provided they are placed within 5 feet of structures being protected and not along property boundaries or stream banks. Temporary shall mean that sand bags are in place no longer than 6 months within any year. Discarded sand bags must be completely removed from areas of special flood hazard.

3. Replacement of rip rap protection at bridge footings, piers and abutments, removal of accumulated sediment from bridges and sedimentation facilities, removal of accumulated sediment from detention ponds and drainage ditches, and other maintenance actions intended to restore the original design dimensions and condition of a constructed facility.

4. Installation and maintenance of underground utilities, and maintenance of streets and other utilities, provided there is no net loss of flood storage capacity.

5. Naturally fallen trees and flood- or storm-deposited sediment and debris in or across the floodplain or floodway areas shall not be considered obstructions or fill for the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 1, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 2, 1981).

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

DD. “Structure” means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

EE. “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

FF. “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of an existing structure, the cumulative cost of which since the year 1980 equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current fair market value of the structure either:

1. Before the proposed improvement or repair (construction) is started; or

2. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing precited violations with existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

(Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2065 § 1, 1995; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 2, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 3, 1981).


16.36.040 Areas of special flood hazard designated.

The areas of special flood hazard include, but are not limited to, those areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington and Incorporated Areas dated April 19, 2005, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), and any revisions hereto, which are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. Other base flood areas may be determined in accordance with IMC 16.36.210(B). The Flood Insurance Study and accompanying FIRMs are on file at the Issaquah Public Works Engineering Department. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2182 § 1, 1998; Ord. 2065 § 2, 1995; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 3, 1989; Ord. 1465(A), 1981).


16.36.060 Interpretation.

A. The designated official is authorized and directed to interpret the provisions of this chapter.

B. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

1. Considered as minimum requirements;

2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1465 § 5(D), 1981).


16.36.070 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1465 § 5(C), 1981).


16.36.080 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

A. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

B. In addition to the terms, conditions and requirements of this chapter, the City’s building code and other City ordinances, any person making application for improvements to lands or structures or construction of new structures on lands included in the areas of special flood hazard shall, as a condition for approval of the permit, provide the City with an executed “Covenant Not to Sue,” as required by Chapter 16.24 IMC. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 4, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 5(E), 1981).


16.36.090 Permits – Required.

A. No land within the areas of special flood hazard shall hereafter be subdivided or short subdivided, improved, filled, graded or cleared; nor shall any structure or development, including manufactured homes, be constructed, reconstructed, improved, relocated, or erected on such lands unless the person(s) responsible for such improvements shall first obtain a flood hazard permit for such action in accord with the provisions of this chapter. When the development results in the displacement of floodwater, the flood hazard permit shall include a certification by a licensed civil engineer registered in the State of Washington that compensatory storage is provided and the hydraulic capability of the floodplain is preserved on-site to convey floodwaters through the property without affecting adjacent properties, in accordance with IMC 16.36.130 and 16.36.140.

B. Certificate of Occupancy. The Building Official shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for a new or substantially improved structure until:

1. An elevation certificate prepared by or under the direct supervision of a Washington State licensed professional land surveyor is submitted and approved by the City prior to a final inspection, or a floodproofing certificate prepared by a Washington State licensed engineer or architect is submitted and approved (nonresidential buildings only).

2. All mitigation identified by the habitat impact assessment pursuant to IMC 16.36.120(K) has been completed. The Director may accept a financial guarantee, in an amount determined by the Director, to ensure completion of such mitigation following issuance of certificate of occupancy.

C. Compliance with the requirements of this chapter is intended to meet the minimum requirements of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which allows City participation in the National Flood Insurance Program and makes Federally subsidized flood insurance available to owners and occupants of structures located in the City. Meeting the minimum standards does not necessarily mean that a structure will receive the lowest insurance premium, as determined by insurance rating factors, that is potentially available for a new or improved structure constructed at a particular location. It is applicant’s responsibility to identify those higher building standards that could potentially improve a structure’s insurance rating and lower the resulting flood insurance premium.

D. Exemptions. Activities that do not meet the definition of “development” in Chapter 18.02 IMC do not require a floodplain development permit. The following are examples of activities not considered development:

1. Routine maintenance of landscaping that does not involve grading, excavation, or filling;

2. Removal of noxious weeds and replacement of nonnative vegetation with native vegetation provided no earth movement occurs;

3. Removal of hazard trees consistent with the requirements of IMC 18.12.1380(C);

4. Normal maintenance of structures, such as reroofing and replacing siding, provided such work does not qualify as a substantial improvement;

5. Normal maintenance of aboveground utilities and facilities, such as replacing downed power lines and utility poles;

6. Normal street and road maintenance, including filling potholes, repaving, and installing signs and traffic signals, but not including expansion of paved areas;

7. Normal maintenance of a levee or other flood control facility prescribed in the operations and maintenance plan for the levee or flood control facility are allowed in the regulatory floodplain without need for a floodplain development permit. Normal maintenance does not include repair from flood damage, expansion of the prism, expansion of the face or toe or addition for protection on the face or toe with rock armor;

8. Normal maintenance, operation or repair of publicly improved recreation areas as long as any such activity does not include expansion of uses and/or facilities into a previously unimproved portion of the regulatory floodplain and is consistent with the standards of Chapter 18.10 IMC, Environmental Protection, best available science or adaptive management plans as recognized by the City; and

9. Site investigative work and studies necessary for preparing land use applications. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 5, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 6(A), 1981).

5. Habitat assessment checklist, assessment, biological opinion, or proof of Endangered Species Act review and approval through Federal permits or consultation, as required by IMC 16.36.120(K). (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1465 § 6(B, C), 1981).


16.36.110 Permit – Fees.

A fee shall accompany the permit application in accordance with IMC 3.65.040(I), Flood Hazard Permit Application Fees. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 6, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 6(D), 1981).


16.36.120 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:

A. Anchoring.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

2. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).

B. Construction Materials and Methods.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

3. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

C. Crawlspaces. Crawlspaces are allowed in residential and nonresidential construction only where the difference in elevation between the crawlspace interior grade and lowest adjacent exterior grade is 2 feet or less, the total height of the crawlspace as measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the bottom of the floor joists is 4 feet or less, and adequate drainage is provided to remove floodwaters within a reasonable amount of time after a flood event. Interpretation and application of these requirements shall be consistent with official FEMA technical bulletin guidance on crawlspace construction. Other types of foundations, such as open pile or column foundations, that allow free-flow of floodwaters may be required in high velocity areas (i.e., velocities exceeding 5 feet per second). Below grade crawlspaces constructed in accordance with these requirements will not be considered basements. Crawlspaces that are excavated below grade will result in higher flood insurance premiums.

D. Utilities.

1. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;

2. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and

3. On-site disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. On-site disposal systems require permits and approval by Seattle-King County Department of Public Health.

4. Utility transmission lines transporting hazardous substances shall be buried at a minimum depth of 4 feet below the maximum depth of scour for the base flood as predicted by a Washington State licensed professional civil engineer and shall achieve sufficient negative buoyancy so that any potential for flotation or upward migration is eliminated.

5. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway.

E. Subdivision Proposals.

1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.

2. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

3. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.

4. Main collector roads serving new subdivisions shall have a surface elevation high enough to be safely used for evacuation in the event of a 100-year flood. In addition, all roads serving new subdivisions shall be of sufficient width to allow parking of vehicles and access for emergency vehicles during periods of inundation.

5. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated by the applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 2 lots or 2 acres, whichever is less.

F. Review of Building Permits. Where base flood elevation data is not available, either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (IMC 16.36.210 (B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate the lowest floor at least 2 feet above the highest existing grade may result in higher insurance rates.

G. Channel Migration and Bank Stabilization. No structure shall be allowed which would be at risk due to stream bank destabilization including that associated with channel relocation or meandering.

H. Temporary Structures. Temporary structures that do not have footings, foundations, or other anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or movement of the structure during floods shall be removed from the floodplain during the flood season from September 30th to May 1st.

I. Flood Walls. No flood walls are allowed except if constructed within 3 feet of a flood-prone structure that is not built to current flood standards. Flood walls shall be designed by a qualified engineer to withstand hydrostatic pressures and undermining of footings. Flood walls are also subject to the floodway encroachment standard in IMC 16.36.140, and reduction in floodplain conveyance and storage due to flood wall construction shall require mitigation. A flood wall is not meant to include a building wall or foundation that is associated with an approved structure. Applicants constructing flood walls shall be notified that flood insurance premiums for residential structures will still be based on lowest floor elevations regardless of the effect of the flood wall.

J. Flood Hazard Notification. Base flood data and flood hazard notes shall be shown on the face of the recorded plat, including, but not limited to, the base flood elevation, required flood protection elevations, and the boundaries of the floodplain. The following note, or similar language, shall appear on the face of the recorded plat and on the individual titles for all affected lots:

NOTICE

Lots and structures located within flood hazard areas may be inaccessible by emergency vehicles and personnel during flood events. Residents and property owners should take appropriate advance precautions. Property damage and personal safety risks may occur.

K. Habitat Impact Assessment.

1. A permit application to develop in the regulatory floodplain shall include an assessment of the impact of the project on Federal, State or locally protected species and habitat, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as implemented by FEMA Region X under the National Flood Insurance Program for Puget Sound. The applicant shall submit sufficient information to support the assessment, in the form of a checklist, habitat assessment, biological opinion, or other documentation. The City will determine the submittal and review requirements depending on the nature and extent of the project. The City may require a habitat assessment or biological opinion prepared by a consultant, or peer review by a consultant not associated with an applicant. This additional peer review shall be at the applicant’s expense.

2. ESA review under a Federal permit, such as through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or through another Federal consultation process, meets the requirement for a habitat impact assessment under this subsection K and no additional submittal or review is required. Proof of such Federal review shall be submitted.

3. If the habitat impact assessment submitted to the City (or through any other ESA review process such as a Federal permit) concludes that the project is expected to have an adverse effect on listed species as evaluated under the guidance issued for ESA compliance under the National Flood Insurance Program in Puget Sound, the applicant shall mitigate those impacts. Such mitigation shall be consistent with, or in addition to, any mitigation required by critical area regulations in Chapter 18.10 IMC or other City mitigation requirements and shall be incorporated into the approved project plans.

4. Activities Exempt from Habitat Impact Assessment. The following activities within a floodplain are deemed to have no impact on listed species and are exempt from the habitat impact assessment requirements in this subsection K:

a. Repair or remodeling of an existing structure, if the repair or remodeling is not a substantial improvement, or a repair of substantial damage.

b. Expansion of an existing structure that is no greater than 10 percent beyond its existing footprint; provided, that the repairs or remodeling is not a substantial improvement, or a repair of substantial damage. This measurement is counted cumulatively from September 22, 2011. If the structure is in the floodway, there shall be no change in the dimensions perpendicular to flow.

c. Activities with the sole purpose of creating, restoring, or enhancing natural functions provided the activities do not include structures, grading, fill, or impervious surfaces.

d. Development of open space and recreational facilities, such as parks and trails, that do not include structures, fill, impervious surfaces or removal of more than 5 percent of the native vegetation on that portion of the property in the regulatory floodplain.

e. Repair to on-site septic systems provided the ground disturbance is the minimum necessary.

f. Alterations in response to emergencies which threaten the public health, safety and welfare or which pose an imminent risk of damage to private property consistent with the requirements of IMC 18.10.100.

g. Other minor activities considered to have no effect on listed species, as interpreted using ESA guidance issued by the National Flood Insurance Program in Puget Sound and confirmed through City review of the development proposal. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 7, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 7(A), 1981).


16.36.130 Specific standards (Zone AE).

In all areas of special flood hazards designated with the letters AE where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in IMC 16.36.040 or 16.36.210(B), the following provisions are required:

A. Residential Construction. New construction, substantial improvement of any residential structure, and improvement of any post-FIRM residential structure shall have the lowest floor and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other utility and service facilities elevated to at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation.

1. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be certified by a registered professional engineer and must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a. A minimum of 2 openings having a total net free area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above the adjacent exterior grade;

c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; and provided, that the screens, louvers, or other devices meet the requirements of the International Building Code.

B. Nonresidential Construction. New construction, substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure, and improvement of any post-FIRM commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other utility and service facilities elevated to at least 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

1. Be floodproofed so that up to a level of 1 foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

2. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

3. Be certified by a registered professional engineer that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in IMC 16.36.210(C)(2);

4. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection A of this section;

5. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are 1 foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).

C. Compensatory Storage and No Reduction in Floodplain Conveyance Required. Development proposals shall not reduce the effective base flood storage volume of the floodplain, and also shall not reduce the hydraulic capability of the floodplain on site to convey floodwaters through the property during the base flood event. The compensatory storage requirement means that the project shall not result in any additional net fill within the floodplain. No reduction in floodplain conveyance means that no rise in base flood elevations is allowed on adjacent properties. Providing this compensatory conveyance capacity can be done in conjunction with the compensatory storage. Compensatory storage can be provided either on site or at a hydraulically connected off-site location, and can be obtained from a previous project that was constructed by the applicant or by another owner who provides written permission; provided, that excess and unused compensatory storage is available from that project. A floodplain hydraulic study prepared by a licensed civil engineer registered in the State of Washington may be required to verify compliance with the compensatory storage and compensatory conveyance requirements. Certification by the engineer that appropriate hydraulic modeling methods were used to comply with these requirements shall accompany the flood hazard permit. In lieu of an engineering study the applicant must be able to provide adequate information that demonstrates an understanding of floodplain conveyance and compliance with this section.

D. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is 1 foot above the base flood elevation and shall be securely anchored to an anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of IMC 16.36.120(A).

E. Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on their wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the requirements for manufactured homes.

F. Bank Improvements. Where proposed development or improvements include modifications or work within the portion of the stream channel under the jurisdiction of the Washington Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (WDFW), an application shall also be made for a State hydraulics permit approval (HPA), the application for which is through WDFW using a joint aquatic resource permit application (JARPA). Once the State HPA permit is approved, application shall be made for the permit required by this chapter.

G. Critical Facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the base floodplain. Construction of critical facilities shall be permissible within the base floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to 3 or more feet above the level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to assure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base floodplain shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

H. AE and A1-A30 Zones with Base Flood Elevations but Not Floodways. In areas with base flood elevations, but where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it has been determined that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 1 foot at any point in the community.

I. Alteration of Watercourses.

1. In addition to the other requirements in this section, an application for a development activity which results in any change to a regulatory floodway boundary or base flood elevation, or greater than 1/2 foot change to base flood elevations outside of the floodway, shall also submit a request for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR), where required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The project will not be approved unless FEMA issues the CLOMR (which requires ESA consultation) and the provisions of the letter are made part of the permit requirements.

2. The Director shall notify affected adjacent communities, the Department of Ecology, and Federal Emergency Management Agency Region X prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.

3. The Director shall require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2115 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2065 § 3, 1995; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1872 § 7, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 7(B), 1981).


16.36.140 Floodways.

Located within the area of special flood hazard established in IMC 16.36.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. New construction and substantial improvements meeting this standard shall comply with all applicable provisions of IMC 16.36.130.

B. All new construction, substantial improvement, any improvement to a structure that increases the ground floor area, and relocation of structures, including manufactured homes, is prohibited. Work done on structures to correct existing violations with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes which have been identified by the local code enforcement or building official and are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions may be excluded in the monetary calculation of a substantial improvement. A residential dwelling located partially within a designated floodway will be considered as totally within a designated floodway and must comply with this chapter. However, the floodway prohibition in this subsection does not apply to existing farmhouses in designated floodways that meet the provisions of WAC 173-158-075, or to substantially damaged residential dwellings other than farmhouses that meet the depth and velocity and erosion analysis provisions of subsection D of this section, or to structures identified as historical places.

C. Agricultural uses, including crops, nursery stock, tree farming, stream improvements and all stream maintenance functions or operations of any government agencies, or private individuals, public works such as streets, bridges, water and sewer and other underground utility lines, and park and recreational facilities, excluding structures, may be permitted in the floodway when shown to be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.

D. Substantially Damaged Residential Dwellings in Floodways Other Than Farmhouses. For all substantially damaged residential structures, other than farmhouses, located in a designated floodway, the Department of Ecology, at the request of the City, is authorized to assess the risk of harm to life and property posed by the specific conditions of the floodway. Based upon scientific analysis of depth, velocity, flood-related erosion and debris load potential, the Department of Ecology may exercise best professional judgment in recommending to the City repair, replacement or relocation of a substantially damaged structure. The property owner shall be responsible for submitting to the City any information necessary to complete the assessment required by this section when such information is not otherwise available.

1. Recommendation to repair or replace a substantially damaged residential structure located in the regulatory floodway shall be based on the flood characteristics at the site. In areas of the floodway that are subject to shallow and low velocity flooding, low flood-related erosion potential, and adequate flood warning time to ensure evacuation, the Department of Ecology may recommend the replacement or repair of the damaged structure. Any substantially damaged residential structure located in the regulatory floodway in a high risk zone based on the flood characteristics will not be recommended to be repaired or replaced. Flood warning times must be 12 hours or greater, except if the local government demonstrates that it has a flood warning system and/or emergency plan in operation. For purposes of this subsection, flood characteristics must include:

a. Flood depths cannot exceed more than 3 feet; flood velocities cannot exceed more than 3 feet per second.

b. No Evidence of Flood-Related Erosion. Flood erosion will be determined by location of the project site in relationship to channel migration boundaries adopted by the City. Absent channel migration boundaries, flood erosion will be determined by evidence of existing overflow channels and bank erosion.

2. At the request of the City, the Department of Ecology will prepare a report of findings and recommendations for the City concurrence on repair or replacement of substantially damaged residential structures located in the regulatory floodway. Without a recommendation from the Department of Ecology for the repair or replacement of a substantially damaged residential structure located in the regulatory floodway, no repair or replacement is allowed per subsection B of this section.

3. Before the repair, replacement, or reconstruction is started, all other requirements of this chapter must be satisfied. In addition the following conditions must be met:

a. There is no potential safe building location for the replacement residential structure on the same property outside the regulatory floodway.

b. A replacement residential structure is a residential structure built as a substitute for a previously existing residential structure of equivalent use and size.

c. Repairs or reconstruction or replacement of a residential structure shall not increase the total square footage of floodway encroachment.

d. The elevation of the lowest floor of the substantially damaged or replacement residential structure is a minimum of 1 foot higher than the base flood elevation.

e. New and replacement water supply systems are designed to eliminate or minimize infiltration of floodwater into the system.

f. New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems are designed and located to eliminate or minimize infiltration of floodwater into the system and discharge from the system into the floodwaters.

g. All other utilities and connections to public utilities are designed, constructed, and located to eliminate or minimize flood damage. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 8, 1989; Ord. 1465 § 7(C), 1981).


16.36.145 Shallow flooding areas (AO zones).

Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in those zones range from 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

A. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures, and to ensure that floodwater in likely flow pathways such as swales is not blocked and cause it to be diverted to adjacent properties.

B. New construction, substantial improvement of any residential structure and manufactured home, and improvement of any post-FIRM residential structure and manufactured home within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade to the structure, 1 foot or more above the depth number specified in feet on the community’s FIRM (at least 2 feet above the highest adjacent grade to the structure if no depth number is specified):

1. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be certified by a registered professional engineer and must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a. A minimum of 2 openings having a total net free area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above the adjacent exterior grade;

c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; and provided, that the screens, louvers, or other devices meet the requirements of the International Building Code.

C. New construction, substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure, and improvement of any post-FIRM commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure within AO zones shall either:

1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, 1 foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or

2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer as set forth in IMC 16.36.090(B).

3. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are 1 foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as 1 foot below that level).

D. Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on their wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

3. Meet the requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005).


16.36.150 Hazardous materials.

The placement or storage of chemicals, petroleum products or by-products, fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, lime, cement or other material that, when inundated, will contribute to or constitute a hazard to life, health and safety, and/or adversely affect the quality of surface waters is prohibited within the areas of special flood hazard. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1465 § 7(D), 1981).


16.36.160 Appeals.

Any person aggrieved by a decision or interpretation of the designated official relative to the provisions of this chapter may appeal such decision to the Hearing Examiner as established by the City and shall comply with all procedural requirements prescribed by the Hearing Examiner and Chapter 1.32 IMC, Appeals. The Hearing Examiner shall affirm the decision unless from a review of the record it is determined the decision being appealed was clearly erroneous. (Ord. 2775 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2420 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2301 § 5, 2001; Ord. 2030 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1827 § 9, 1989; Ord. 1777 § 1, 1988; Ord. 1465 § 4(E), 1981).


16.36.170 Variances.

A. Purpose. The variance provision is provided to property owners who, due to the strict implementation of standards set forth in this chapter, and/or due to unique circumstances regarding the subject property, are deprived of privilege commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same vicinity and flood area and under the same flood regulation; provided, however, the fact that surrounding properties have been developed under regulations in force prior to the adoption of this code shall not be the sole basis for the granting of a variance.

B. Variance Criteria.

1. Variances shall only be issued upon:

a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;

d. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria and otherwise complies with IMC 16.36.120 and 16.36.130.

2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

5. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the provisions of subsection C of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variances increases.

C. In passing upon such variance applications, the Hearing Examiner shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

16.38.010 Purpose and applicability.

A. Purpose. Fats, oil and grease cause many problems in sanitary sewer lines. Fats, oil and grease collect on the sides of pipes, and bacteria that feed on fats, oil and grease produce corrosive acids and gas that will damage pipes and manholes. Sewer blockages that result can overflow onto streets and property, disrupting residential, commercial, and industrial operations, and carry the potential for health risks. The cost of increased maintenance and replacement of sewer lines is high, as well as the potential impacts to the environment. The requirements set forth in this chapter are designed to aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulation of animal or vegetable derived fats, oil and greases discharged to the sanitary sewer system from industrial or commercial establishments, particularly food preparation and serving facilities.

The objectives of this chapter are to use reasonable and technically feasible controls to:

1. Prevent sanitary sewer overflows caused by fats, oils and grease.

2. Reduce the amount of fats, oils and grease discharged to the sanitary sewer collection system.

3. Reduce maintenance costs for the sanitary sewer collection system.

4. Improve operation of the sanitary sewer collection system.

5. Comply with King County Industrial Waste Local Discharge Limits and prohibited discharges.

In addition, those responsible for generating or contributing to unlawful discharge of fats, oil and grease to the sanitary sewer system must take immediate steps to bring the grease interceptor or other grease removal device into compliance, plus any additional actions necessary to bring the facility into compliance with this chapter. 

A. Civil Remedies. Any work or other activities which are within the authority of this chapter in violation of any lawful order or requirement of the Director is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated in a manner prescribed by the permit authority. Injunction proceedings or other appropriate action may be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter in order to prevent, enjoin, abate or terminate violations of this chapter. 

B. Persons Subject to Penalty. Any person who violates or fails to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of this chapter or who fails to conform to the terms of an approval or order issued by the Director shall be subject to the civil and criminal penalties provided in Chapter 1.36 IMC, Code Enforcement. Each day of continued violation shall be considered a separate violation for purposes of penalty.

In addition to implementing the Comprehensive Plan, this Code also further implements the GMA, which requires that local governments adopt development regulations which are consistent with their Comprehensive Plans (RCW 36.70A.0403(d)). This Code also is intended to implement the requirements of the State’s Regulatory Reform Act (ESHB 1724), which has a primary goal of integrating environmental review with Project Permit review. 

B.    Conflict of Provisions: If any conflict arises between this Code and another rule, regulation, resolution, ordinance or statute which has been lawfully adopted by the City, the most restrictive provision shall govern. If any conflict arises between the text, map and any tables of this Code, the text shall govern unless otherwise stated. (Ord. 2108 § 1.9, 1996).


18.01.100 Relationship to existing zoning, and other land use regulations.

To the extent that the provisions of this Code are the same in substance as the previously adopted provisions that they replace in the City’s zoning, and other land use regulations, they shall be considered as continuations and not as new enactments unless otherwise specifically provided. In particular, a situation that did not constitute a lawful nonconforming situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this Code merely by the repeal of the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 2108 § 1.10, 1996).

Purpose and Intent


18.04.010 Purpose.

The purpose of the development review procedures is to provide a predictable method to ensure that all land use actions are consistent with City codes, ordinances, state statutes and other applicable adopted regulations. (Ord. 2108 § 4.1.1, 1996).


18.04.020 Intent.

The intent of the application and review procedures is to:

A.    Establish a process which allows a complete review of each proposal; provide sufficient information to make an informed decision; establish a consistent review process for all projects; and provide notification to adjacent property owners for projects which may impact them, and give those property owners the opportunity for review and public comment; and

B.    Encourage development and/or redevelopment that recognizes the attributes of the property being developed; and incorporates these attributes into the design process; and

C.    Recognize and protect, preserve and enhance the social, cultural, economic, environmental and aesthetic standards that establish the desirable quality and unique character of Issaquah; and

D.    Enhance construction, development and maintenance practices which promote visual quality throughout Issaquah; and

E.    Recognize environmental and aesthetic design and energy efficiency as integral parts of the planning process; and

F.    Provide equitable and timely review of development proposals; and

G.    Provide certainty of project review and Code implementation; and

H.    Provide consistency with applicable development regulations, or in the absence of applicable regulations, the adopted Comprehensive Plan, and provide consistency with the purpose and intent of this Code, and RCW 36.70B.040 (Determination of Consistency). (Ord. 2108 § 4.1.2, 1996).

Procedures: Development Review Process – Levels of Review


18.04.030 Purpose.

The purpose of this section is to specify the general procedures to be followed when processing and reviewing applications for all land use actions. The intent of these procedures is to provide consistent and efficient review within the scheduled time frames set forth in this chapter. Additional procedures for particular types of development review are contained in specific sections of this chapter.

The development review process has been divided into seven (7) levels of review (Level 0-6) for the purpose of clarifying the procedures for the review and decision-making of land development proposals. All development proposals will be reviewed through one (1) or more of the levels prior to final decision-making. The optional consolidated permit review process provides a means by which a development proposal can satisfy the requirements of one (1) or more levels of review concurrently while maintaining consistency and streamlining the review process. (Ord. 2108 § 4.2.1, 1996).


18.04.040 Intent.

The intent of the levels of review is to provide appropriate degrees of review with appropriate decision-making bodies for various land use actions and permits. Generally the development proposals with the least potential for impacts are reviewed through a Level 0 Review and the decision is made administratively. The development proposals with the greatest potential for impacts are reviewed through a Level 6 Review and are decided by the City Council. (Ord. 2108 § 4.2.2, 1996).


18.04.050 Application requirements.

The purpose of a development proposal application is to provide a method to monitor and organize proposals for development review, to provide complete information to project reviewers and decision-makers, and to ensure that a predictable review process will occur within a reasonable or specified time frame. All applications for land use actions including permits, reclassifications/rezones, amendments, or other approvals or action required or authorized under this Code shall be filed with the Permit Center, unless otherwise required (Note: Some applications may require filing with other City departments such as the City Clerk’s office). The Permit Center will coordinate the review of each application with all appropriate City departments, boards and commissions and external agencies with regulatory authority over the proposal. The applications shall comply with the applicable elements of the development review process listed below. (Ord. 2108 § 4.2.3, 1996).


18.04.060 Single contact designated and signature required.

The City may require the applicant to designate a single person or entity to receive determinations and notices required by this chapter. All applications shall be signed by the property owner and/or applicant or his agent, who is authorized in writing to be the agent for the applicant/property owner, or, if the applicant is a department within the City, that Department Head or his/her appointee shall be the agent. (Ord. 2108 § 4.2.4, 1996).


18.04.070 Official filing of application.

No application shall be considered officially filed until determined as complete by the Permit Center. (Ord. 2108 § 4.2.5, 1996).


18.04.080 Fees.

The appropriate fees for all permits shall be charged to the applicant per the Fee Schedule. Fees may be refunded in accordance with IMC 3.64.040, Refund of fees. (Ord. 2648 § 3 (Exh. A2b), 2012; Ord. 2108 § 4.2.6, 1996).


18.04.090 Concurrent Building Permit review option.

All development proposals, including the optional Consolidated Permit Review Process, are subject to Project Permit approval prior to Building Permit application unless otherwise allowed by the Building Official. (Ord. 2108 § 4.2.7, 1996).


18.04.100 Levels of Review Matrix.

A.    The Levels of Review Matrix (Table 18.04.100-1) on the following pages lists the levels of review that are required for each land use and/or related decision.

B.    The matrix is intended to provide predictability to project applicants in anticipating the required level of review; however, in order to ensure adequate review and appropriate public notification/participation, the Planning Director/Manager may forward the project to a higher level of review if the proposal is determined to merit increased review based upon one (1) or more of the following criteria:

1.    The proposal is in close proximity to and/or appears to present potential for significant impacts to a critical area or other prominent natural feature.

2.    The proposal is in close proximity to and/or appears to present potential for significant impacts to any public/quasi-public facility, historic site, or residential area.

3.    The proposal represents a significant, though permitted, change in comparison to surrounding properties either by introduction of a different type of land use or by being more than twice the height and/or square footage of surrounding structures.

4.    The proposal appears to present characteristics not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan and/or the Land Use Code and/or the Olde Town Design Standards.

5.    Community concern is documented that: involves potential environmental, land use, or transportation impacts not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan and/or Land Use Code; is received in a timely manner; and is determined to warrant additional review.

C.    No additional fee is required from the applicant if a higher level review is determined to be necessary. (Ord. 2543 § 2, 2008; Ord. 2462 § 3, 2006; Ord. 2447 § 23, 2005; Ord. 2388 §§ 3, 10, 2004; Ord. 2383 § 5, 2004; Ord. 2345 § 2, 2002; Ord. 2301 § 5, 2001; Ord. 2164 §§ 2, 4, 13, 1997; Ord. 2108 § 4.2.8, 1996).


18.04.105 Statement of restrictions applicable to real property.

A.    A property owner may make a request, upon a form provided by the Permit Center, for a statement of restrictions applicable to real property located in the City. The request shall be filed with the Permit Center.

B.    Within thirty (30) days of the filing of a completed request form with the filing fee required by subsection (A) of this section, the Planning Director or his/her designee shall mail to the owner, at the address specified on the request form, a statement of restrictions as described in subsection (C) of this section.

C.    The statement of restrictions shall include the following:

1.    The zoning currently applicable to the real property;

2.    Pending zoning changes currently advertised for public hearing that would be applicable to the real property; and

3.    Any designations made by the City of the real property or a portion of the real property as agricultural land, forest land, mineral resource land, or a critical area, pursuant to Chapter 18.10 IMC.

D.    For purposes of this section:

1.    “Owner” means any vested owner or any person holding the buyer’s interest under a recorded real estate contract in which the seller is the vested owner; and

2.    “Real property” means a parcel, tract, lot or block:

a.    Containing a single family residence that is occupied by the owner or a member of his or her family, or rented to another by the owner; or

b.    Five (5) acres or less in size. (Ord. 2164 § 15, 1997).

Change of Use: The intent of the review process for a Change of Use is to: 1) recognize that there is typically a lesser impact in a Change of Use than in new construction; and 2) require a higher Level of Review, as permitted in IMC 18.04.220(F), Option for Review Level Changes, in the individual cases where this is not the case.

1    a) Community Facilities Zone: Changes of Use in the Community Facilities zones are reviewed as listed in IMC 18.06.130, Table of Permitted Land Uses, regardless of the previous use.

    b) Changes of Use shall be processed through the Level of Review listed in this table, regardless of the parcel size or street frontage.

2    Specified Uses: This table does not apply to Changes of Use for a recreational marijuana facility (marijuana producer, processor, and/or retailer), adult entertainment facility, or secure community transition facility. These uses are reviewed as listed in IMC 18.06.130, Table of Permitted Land Uses, regardless of the previous use. 

 

Table 18.04.100-4 Zoning Intensity Matrix to Determine Site Posting Requirement* 

	This table delineates Issaquah’s Zoning Districts in a spectrum of least intensive to most intensive. Posting of a site for purposes of notification will be required for proposed rezones to more intensive zoning districts, but is not required for proposed rezones to less intensive districts. 

(For example: A rezone from SF-E Single Family Estates to SF-D Single Family Duplex would require posting whereas a rezone from R Retail to PO Professional Office would not.)

18.04.120 Feasibility meeting.

A potential applicant may request to meet with a staff member (planner), informally, to discuss general aspects about a proposed project and gather information regarding zoning, critical area mapping and other pertinent rules and regulations which relate to the anticipated development proposal. All feasibility meetings are optional and initiated at the request of the potential applicant. (Ord. 2108 § 4.3.2, 1996).


18.04.130 Pre-application meeting.

Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall schedule a conference with City staff representatives from all departments involved with development review. The pre-application meeting is optional for some levels of review and required for others (see Chapter 18.10 IMC, Appendix, Flow Charts for Levels of Review 0 – 6).

A.    Purpose: The purpose of the pre-application meeting is for the applicant to become familiar with the policies, plans and development requirements of the City; for staff and the applicant to review the general characteristics of the site and the concepts for a proposed project; and to discuss the coordination of all necessary permits and procedures. The intent of the pre-application conference is to save the applicant time and resources in the preparation of the application.

B.    Required Meetings: All projects requiring a Development Permit and located on land zoned Community Facilities shall be reviewed by affected City departments through a project review meeting.

C.    Application: The request for the pre-application meeting shall be submitted to the Permit Center on an application form provided by the Permit Center. The information requested on the form must be completed and all information submitted prior to the Permit Center scheduling a meeting.

E.    Expectations: The applicant can expect the following results from the meeting:

1.    The more information an applicant can provide for a pre-application meeting, the more complete the staff’s review and input will be for the proposal;

2.    Any information or opinions expressed by the staff shall not be binding on the final decision or constitute approval or denial of the proposed project;

3.    Inconsistency with the Comprehensive Plan, this Code and other applicable policies and regulations will be discussed;

4.    Staff and applicant should discuss creative approaches to address challenging site constraints or potential mitigations;

5.    Recommended revisions or modifications to the proposal will be discussed; and

18.04.140 Community Conference.

A.    Purpose: The Community Conference is an informal public meeting hosted by the Development Commission. The purpose of the meeting is to generate discussion, raise issues, and propose creative options relative to the proposed project. It is intended to provide a means by which the applicant, staff, the Development Commission, and the public are able to work together in a productive and creative manner. However, options and issues raised may not be all inclusive and no guarantees on the project outcome are made at this stage.

B.    Expectations: The applicant can expect the following results from the Community Conference:

1.    The more information an applicant can provide for a Community Conference, the more complete the staff’s review and input will be for the proposal;

2.    Any information or opinions expressed by the Development Commission or the staff shall not be binding on the final decision or constitute approval or denial of the proposed project;

3.    Inconsistency with the Comprehensive Plan, this Code and other applicable policies and regulations will be discussed;

4.    Development Commission, staff and applicant should discuss creative approaches to address challenging site constraints or potential mitigations;

5.    Recommended revisions or modifications to the proposal will be discussed; and

6.    The applicant should be aware that additional modifications will most likely be required before the project review is final and a decision has been made.

C.    Process: The Community Conference shall be held in a place that is readily available to the public and large enough to accommodate the anticipated number of people who may be present at the meeting. Notice shall be provided as set forth under Public Notification. (Ord. 2108 § 4.3.4, 1996).


18.04.150 Complete application – Sufficiency review.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of requiring a complete application and sufficiency review is to provide the Permit Center, staff, boards, commissions, and decision-making bodies with the appropriate level and degree of information regarding a proposed development in order to facilitate the review and decision-making. By requiring this step early in the process, the applicant is made aware of City requirements and the proposed application is reviewed and processed in a timely and efficient manner.

B.    Process: Application for development proposals, including project certification, shall be made in writing to the Permit Center. The appropriate forms are provided by the Permit Center and all applications must be completed in full and must provide all the information required.



1.    Written Determination: Within twenty-eight (28) days after receiving a Project Permit application, the City shall mail or provide in person a written determination to the applicant, stating either:

a.    That the application is complete; or

b.    That the application is incomplete and what is necessary to make the application complete. To the extent known by the City, the City shall identify other agencies of local, state, or federal governments that may have jurisdiction over some aspect of the application.

2.    Determination of Completeness Criteria: A Project Permit application is complete for purposes of this section when it meets the procedural submission requirements of the City and is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequently. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the City from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or subsequently if new information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur.

a.    An application shall be deemed complete under this section if the City does not provide a written determination to the applicant that the application is incomplete as provided in subsection (B)(1)(b) of this section.

b.    Within fourteen (14) days after an applicant has submitted to the City additional information identified as being necessary for a complete application, the City shall notify the applicant whether the application is complete or what additional information is necessary.

3.    Optional Criteria: The determination of completeness may include the following as optional information:

a.    A preliminary determination of those development regulations that will be used for project mitigation;

b.    A preliminary determination of consistency, which may include consideration of the type of land use, the level of development, such as units per acre or other measures of density, infrastructure including public facilities and services needed to serve the development, and the character of the development, such as development standards; 

c.    Other information the City chooses to include.

4.    Concurrency: When applicable, a determination of completeness shall include approved concurrency certificates for transportation consistent with Chapter 18.15 IMC, Transportation Concurrency Management, and for water consistent with Chapter 13.100 IMC, Water Supply Availability Management.

5.    Nothing in this section requires documentation, dictates the City’s procedures for considering consistency, or limits the City from requesting additional information with respect to a complete application. (Ord. 2405 § 7, 2004; Ord. 2108 § 4.3.5, 1996).


18.04.160 Consolidated permit review process.

A.    The applicant may request an integrated and consolidated review and decision of two (2) or more Project Permits relating to a proposed action, including:

1.    A single application review and approval process covering all Project Permits requested by an applicant for all or part of a project action, and 

2.    A designated permit coordinator. If an applicant elects this process, the determination of completeness, notice of application and notice of final decision must include all Project Permits being reviewed in this process. Consolidated review may provide different procedures for different categories of Project Permits, but if a project action requires Project Permits from more than one (1) category, the City shall provide for consolidated permit review with a single open record hearing and no more than one (1) closed record appeal as provided in this chapter. The decision of all permits shall be made by the decision-maker of the highest level of review. The consolidated permit review may combine an open record predecision hearing on one (1) or more permits with an open record appeal hearing on other permits. In such cases a closed record appeal shall be subject to permits that previously had an open record hearing.

B.    Joint Public Hearings: The City and all agencies of the State of Washington, including municipal corporations and counties participating in a combined hearing, may issue joint hearing notices and develop a joint format, select a mutually acceptable hearing body or officer, and take such other actions as may be necessary to hold joint hearings consistent with each of their respective statutory obligations.

1.    Decision to Hold Joint Hearing: The City may combine any hearing on a Project Permit with any hearing that may be held by another local, state, regional, federal, or other agency, provided:

a.    The hearing is held within the City limits;

b.    The other agency is not expressly prohibited by statute from doing so;

c.    Sufficient notice of the hearing is given to meet each of the agencies’ adopted notice requirements as set forth in statute, ordinance or rule; and

d.    The agency has received the necessary information about the proposed project from the applicant to hold its hearing at the same time as the City hearing.

2.    Applicant’s Request for a Joint Hearing: The applicant may request that the public hearing on a permit application be combined as long as the joint hearing can be held within the required time periods set forth in this chapter, or the applicant agrees to the schedule in the event that additional time is needed in order to combine the hearings. (Ord. 2108 § 4.3.6, 1996).


18.04.170 Notice of application.

The City shall provide a written notice of application to the public and the departments and agencies with jurisdiction as provided in this section. If the City has made a determination of significance under Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA) concurrently with the notice of application, the notice of application shall be combined with the determination of significance and scoping notice. Nothing in this section prevents a determination of significance and scoping notice from being issued prior to the notice of application.

A.    Notice of Application Timeline and Contents: The notice of application shall be provided within fourteen (14) days after the determination of completeness and include the following:

1.    The date of application, the date of notice of completion for the application, and the date of the notice of application;

The City may accept public comments at any time prior to the closing of the record of an open record predecision hearing, if any, or, if no open record predecision hearing is provided, prior to the decision on the Project Permit. The applicant for a Project Permit is deemed to be a participant in any comment period, open record hearing, or closed record appeal;

6.    The date, time, place, and type of hearing, if applicable, and scheduled at the date of notice of application;

7.    A statement of the preliminary determination, if one has been made at the time of notice, of:

D.    A notice of application shall not be required for Project Permits that are categorically exempt under Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA), unless a public comment period or an open record predecision hearing is required.

E.    The City shall integrate the permit procedures in this section with environmental review under Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA) as follows:

1.    Except for a determination of significance, the City may not issue its threshold determination, or issue a decision or a recommendation on a Project Permit until the expiration of the public comment period on the notice of application.

2.    If an open record predecision hearing is required and the City’s threshold determination requires public notice under Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA), the City shall issue its threshold determination at least fifteen (15) days prior to the open record predecision hearing.

F.    The applicant for a Project Permit is deemed to be a participant in any comment period, open record hearing, or closed record appeal. (Ord. 2108 § 4.3.7, 1996).

(Ord. 2746 § 8 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 2596 § 3 (Exh. B2), 2010; Ord. 2553 § 4 (Exh. B3), 2009; Ord. 2501 § 5, 2007; Ord. 2491 § 9, 2007; Ord. 2462 § 6, 2006; Ord. 2301 § 5, 2001; Ord. 2164 § 5, 1997; Ord. 2108 § 4.3.8, 1996).


18.04.190 Project assessment.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of project assessment is to review the complete application, site plan, project proposal and special studies for compliance with the adopted City rules and regulations which govern development. The review should be unbiased and should take place in a predictable, efficient and timely manner.

B.    Process: A completed development application, once deemed complete, shall be circulated by the Permit Center to pertinent City departments. Each department shall carefully consider whether or not the specific governing policies, rules and regulations relative to their specific areas of responsibility have been met and shall carefully consider the specific guidelines or standards for approval, where applicable. Each department shall forward written comments and/or compliance concerns to the Permit Center, and shall include the reasoning behind their compliance concerns. 

C.    State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA): The State Environmental Policy Act may apply to any development application. See this chapter and Chapter 18.10 IMC (SEPA) for additional information regarding additional notice provisions, decision authority and other review requirements for SEPA. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Planning Department for additional information. (Ord. 2108 § 4.3.9, 1996).


18.04.200 Staff report and recommendations.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of preparing a staff report and making recommendations to the decision-making body is to facilitate the review and decision-making process by providing the information and analysis in a concise and clear format. The staff report will provide the factual and logical information from which the Administration’s recommendation is derived. 

B.    Process: Based on the information provided by the applicant and the technical and design analysis of the development proposal provided by the pertinent City departments, and state and federal agencies, where applicable, a staff report and recommendations shall be compiled by the Planning Department and presented to the recommendation-making or decision-making bodies. This report shall address all technical and design issues of the project and shall include the comments and recommendations of the City staff, relevant boards and commissions, and the general public. The staff report will be used as background information for recommendation-making or decision-making. The staff report shall also state all the decisions or recommendations made as of the date of the report on all Project Permits included in the consolidated permit process that do not require an open record predecision hearing and any recommendations on Project Permits that do require an open record predecision hearing. The report shall state any mitigation required or proposed under the development regulations or the agency’s authority under RCW 43.21C.060 (SEPA). If a threshold determination, other than a determination of significance, has not been issued previously by the City, the report shall include or append this determination.

Periodic Review of Mineral Resource Sites


18.05.020 Purpose.

The periodic review process for M (Mineral Resource) zoned sites and those sites operating as legal nonconforming uses shall include sufficient public notice and comment opportunities. The purpose of the periodic review process is to provide opportunities for public review and comment on the mineral resource facility’s fulfillment of state and City regulations and implementation of industry standard best management practices, and for the City to modify, add or remove conditions to address new circumstances and/or unanticipated project-generated impacts. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).


18.05.030 Intent.

The periodic review process is not intended to re-examine the appropriateness of the mineral resource use, or to consider expansion of operations beyond the scope of existing permitted operations since that review would be accomplished through the City’s permitting process. The periodic review is intended to be a part of the City’s ongoing enforcement and inspections of mineral resource sites, and not to be a part of the City’s permitting process. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).

B.    The City shall use reasonable methods, as listed in the public notification section of this chapter, to give notice of periodic review to the public and agencies with jurisdiction. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).


18.05.060 Public notification.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of public notification is to provide opportunity for public participation in the periodic review process for mineral resource operations which may have impacts on the adjacent property owners or the surrounding community.

B.    Public Notice Requirements: The following notice types shall be provided for the different land use actions and levels of review listed below:

1.    Notice of Periodic Review Commencement: Parties of record; notification to adjacent property owners and property posting with a four (4) foot by eight (8) foot board.

2.    Notice of Decision: Parties of record, notification to adjacent property owners.

Periodic review is conducted administratively with solicited public input through notice to adjacent property owners. Requests for comment on mineral resource operations are routed to relevant/applicable City departments. Adjacent property owners are notified and given a twenty-one (21) day comment period. Comments of the public and City departments are addressed by the applicant prior to a written decision of the Planning Director/Manager. The written decision shall show facts, findings and conclusions supporting the decision and demonstrating compliance with the applicable decision criteria. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).


18.05.080 Periodic review criteria.

Any revision of existing grading permit operating conditions shall be determined in accordance with IMC 18.05.030(B)(2) and the purpose and intent of this chapter. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).


18.05.090 Notice of periodic review decision.

The Planning Director/Manager shall be responsible for mailing the notice of decision to the mineral resource operator and to any person who, prior to rendering the decision, requested notice of the decision or submitted substantive comments on the periodic review. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).


18.05.100 Administrative appeal.

The final decision of the Planning Director/Manager regarding the periodic review process may be appealed by a party of record with standing. An administrative appeal of the periodic review decision, combined with any environmental determinations, shall be filed within twenty-one (21) days of the issuance of the decision.

The City shall provide for no more than one (1) consolidated open hearing on such appeal before the Hearing Examiner. The time period shall not exceed ninety (90) days for an open record appeal hearing, and sixty (60) days for a closed record appeal. All of the parties to an appeal may agree to extend these time periods.

Any decision issued on administrative appeal by the Hearing Examiner shall be considered the City’s final decision. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).


18.05.110 Judicial appeal.

Appeals of administrative appeals are heard as judicial appeals. After exhaustion of administrative appeals, the City’s final decision may be appealed by a party of record with standing to file a land use petition in King County Superior Court under Chapter 36.70C RCW (Judicial Review of Land Use Decisions). Such petition must be filed within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the decision, as provided in Chapter 36.70C RCW. (Ord. 2233 § 8, 1999).

6.    Coordinate land use patterns with pedestrian and bicycle linkages;

7.    Balance environmental concerns with developmental pressures without allowing development pressures to override environmental concerns; and

8.    Assure that the use of lands adjacent to mineral resource lands does not interfere with the continued use, in the accustomed manner and in accordance with best management practices, of these designated lands for the extraction of minerals.

B.    Promote Quality of Life and “a People Place”:

1.    Work toward preserving the hometown feeling of Issaquah;

2.    Promote pedestrian-oriented facilities;

7.    Acknowledge the importance of cultural activities; 

8.    Use development standards and design guidelines to enhance and preserve the existing scale and design of Issaquah; 

9.    Provide sidewalks, bike paths and trails as nonmotorized transportation alternatives and require connecting linkages between existing sidewalks, bike paths and trails;

5.    Recognize manmade constraints; and

6.    Preserve environmentally critical areas. (Ord. 2405 § 3, 2004; Ord. 2108 § 6.1.1, 1996).


18.06.020 Intent statements of each zoning district.

The intent statements of each zoning district define the primary purpose of each district and shall aid in:

A.    Determining the appropriate location of uses;

B.    Determining appropriate conditions for development; and

18.06.030 Interpretation of zoning boundaries.

A.    Jurisdiction Lines: When zoning district boundaries are shown as following or approximately following the City limits, platted lot lines, section lines, half-section lines, or quarter section lines, the zoning boundaries shall be such lines.

B.    Lakes, Rivers and Stream Centerlines: When zoning district boundaries are shown as following or approximately following the centerline of a lake, river or stream, the actual centerline of that lake, river or stream shall be the zoning boundary. In the event of a natural change in the lake, river or stream, the zoning boundaries shall change with the channel’s centerline.

C.    Property Lines: When zoning district boundaries are shown as following or approximately following a property, lot or tract line, the zoning boundaries shall be the actual property, lot or tract line.

Zoning Districts: Intent and General Characteristics


18.06.070 Tradition Plateau Natural Resource Conservation Area – TP-NRCA.

The primary purpose and use of the district is to create a zoning district that is consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan and to protect and preserve natural systems; wildlife habitat areas; water quality; restoration and enhancement of damaged ecological systems; archaeological, cultural and historic resources. This district is also intended to encourage implementation of an environmental education program and the provision of low impact public uses including, but not limited to, low impact recreation uses.

The existing uses within this district include the undeveloped natural resource area and the developed utility station and corridor. This district recognizes that these existing uses are both appropriate and have very different characters. Permitted uses within this district which do not require a level of review by the City include: bird watching, nature study, sightseeing, environmental education, landscape photography, sustained levels of hiking, jogging/training, pets on a leash, authorized motor vehicle use on roads and power lines, and mountain bike riding on roads and power lines. Permitted uses which require a level of review by the City are listed in the Table of Permitted Land Uses in this chapter.

Appropriate buffers and setbacks from the environmentally critical areas shall be required through the critical area regulations for all development applications within this district. In addition to the objectives stated in the Purpose and Intent section of this chapter (which are general to all zoning districts), the following objectives also apply to this district:

18.06.080 Conservancy/Recreation – C-Rec.

The primary purpose and use of this district is to protect environmentally critical areas, including, but not limited to, wetlands, hillsides, wildlife habitat and recharge areas, from impacts associated with more intensive development. These environmentally critical areas are valued as a community resource, both for conservation purposes and public enjoyment. Open space may be combined with a variety of recreational opportunities to serve the local and regional service area; provided, that critical areas are protected, and that an appropriate buffer is provided between critical areas and any manmade disturbances, such as trails, observation towers, and trailheads. In addition to the objectives stated in the Purpose and Intent section of this chapter, the following objectives also apply to this district: 

A.    Support a wide range of recreational opportunities that minimize land disturbance in order to remain consistent with Issaquah’s natural setting, and provide pedestrian/bike path linkages between community amenities, designated open space and the City center;

B.    Minimize public, private and environmental losses due to flooding by enforcing strict development standards in flood hazard areas; and

C.    Provide and preserve local, community and regional open space and environmentally critical areas, parks and the City’s trailheads and related recreation areas. (Ord. 2108 § 6.3.2, 1996).


18.06.090 Community Facilities – CF.

The primary purpose of this district is to provide for public benefit uses on publicly owned property, and to further specify which uses are appropriate for specific properties through the creation of the Community Facilities Open Space (CF-OS), Recreation (CF-R) and Facilities (CF-F) zones. Public lands are a limited resource and all administrative departments, the Council and Boards and Commissions should work collaboratively to determine the best use of public lands for the benefit of the community. Health, safety, public amenity, economic vitality and environmental protection concerns should be balanced in determining use. Multiple public uses are encouraged. The Community Facilities District will separate public land (City, county, school district, special district, state, and federal) that is being utilized or planned for public benefit uses into separate zoning categories. The following objectives also apply to this district:

A.    Compatibility of Land Uses: Establish general standards regarding aesthetics, height, and other development standards for community facilities which ensure compatibility of design, construction and scale, and minimize the impact of these facilities on surrounding uses.

Purpose and Intent


18.07.010 Purpose of the development and design standards.

The purpose of development and design standards is to provide a framework within which a site may be developed. These standards establish requirements for setbacks, impervious surface, building height, and density, and also include provisions for accessory uses and structures. These standards identify the elements which define the aesthetic and architectural character of the site and surrounding areas, and also provide measures to evaluate scale and compatibility as well as enhance the visual appearance of a site. (Ord. 2108 § 7.1.1, 1996).


18.07.020 Intent of the development and design standards.

The intent of the development and design standards is to achieve compatible land uses within zoning districts and surrounding areas by providing uniform regulations throughout each district, encouraging neighborhood stability and consistency, promoting commercial viability and compatibility, and maintaining the existing historic design and scale of Issaquah. All development standards apply to a project whether or not critical areas are present on the site. Development standards, except density, shall be calculated using the gross site area. (Ord. 2108 § 7.1.2, 1996).


18.07.030 Scope.

Chapter 18.07 IMC contains development and design standards applicable to all districts and projects (IMC 18.07.040 through 18.07.360); development and design standards applicable to residential districts and projects (IMC 18.07.370 through 18.07.470); and development and design standards applicable to nonresidential districts and projects (IMC 18.07.480 through 18.07.570). (Ord. 2108 § 7.1.3, 1996).

Development Standards Applicable to All Districts

General Standards


18.07.035 Stormwater LID priority.

Where stormwater low impact development requirements compete with land use development standards the land use standards take precedence within the Central Issaquah Area, and on-site stormwater LID requirements take precedence in all other areas of the City; provided, that in the Central Issaquah Area stormwater LID requirements will be considered to the maximum extent feasible. (Ord. 2783 § 5 (Exh. A5.e), 2016).


18.07.040 Setbacks.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of setbacks is to provide light, air, emergency access, fire protection, buffers between adjoining uses, separation from adjoining lots, and frontage.

B.    Measured: Setbacks are measured from the right-of-way, or from an abutting property line. When two (2) different standards apply to front, rear or side setbacks, the more restrictive setback shall be required.

C.    Setback Requirements to Streets Having Substandard Right-of-Way Widths: 

1.    Whenever any property abutting a public street right-of-way with a substandard dedicated or deeded width is developed or redeveloped, the appropriate setback or buffer width required for future street expansion to standard right-of-way dimensions along with the required setbacks and corresponding buffers shall be reviewed and determined by the Planning Director/Manager based on the following approval criteria: 

a.    The required width of right-of-way specified by the IMC or the previously approved variance to those standards which are specifically applicable to that portion of the right-of-way which abuts the subject property;

b.    The normal setback that would be required if the property abutted a public street right-of-way that complies with the width requirements of the City’s adopted street standards;

c.    The history and source of the existing right-of-way;

d.    A physical description of the existing right-of-way including width and an explanation of the nature and location of existing improvements;

e.    Other setback decisions in the general area which might be considered precedent setting for this situation;

f.    An analysis of the potential for future development in the vicinity;

g.    Pertinent information from any traffic studies of the subject area;

h.    The amount and location of additional right-of-way which the Public Works Department expects to eventually be obtained in the subject area.

2.    In determining the required setback, the additional right-of-way necessary from the subject property shall be provided to bring the substandard width right-of-way up to the width requirements of Chapter 12.04 IMC, and the City’s adopted street standards, in addition to the normal setback width unless substantial evidence exists that supports a conclusion that a lesser right-of-way width is adequate to meet the circulation demands expected on the portion of right-of-way in question.

3.    All improvements required as part of the property development shall be located within the portion of the property not expected to be subject to future right-of-way widening.

D.    Architectural Features in Required Setback: The following architectural features may project up to eighteen (18) inches into any required setback:

1.    Functioning chimneys;

2.    Flues;

3.    Belt courses;

4.    Sills;

5.    Pilasters;

6.    Ornamental features;

7.    Cornices;

8.    Eaves;

9.    Gutters;

10.    Dormer extensions and greenhouse or bay windows; provided, that the structure does not exceed thirty (30) percent of the facade and does not increase the floor area of the building; and

11.    Repealed by Ord. 2553.

12.    Similar structures.

E.    Decks, Porches, Patios, Walkways and other Minor Structural Elements: See Accessory Structures (IMC 18.07.110, Accessory structures – Uninhabitable) for setback information. See Fences, Arbors, Pergolas and Trellises (IMC 18.07.120, Accessory structures – Fences, arbors, pergolas and trellises) for fence, arbor, pergola and trellis setback information.

F.    Exceptions for Energy Efficiency: Where allowed by building code and fire code minimum fire separation distance requirements, exterior insulation may be added such that the exterior wall projects up to four (4) inches into any required setback.

G.    Flexible Setbacks/Cluster Housing: Provisions regarding flexible setbacks including, but not limited to, zero lot line, semi-detached and townhouse development are found in Residential Standards: Cluster Housing (Article IV of this chapter) and in Administrative Adjustment of Standards (Article II of this chapter).

H.    Administrative Adjustment of Standards: An Administrative Adjustment of Standards may be permitted through the Administrative Adjustment of Standards review process and approval criteria (Article II of this chapter). (Ord. 2664 § 4 (Exh. A3), 2012; Ord. 2562 § 4 (Exh. B3), 2009; Ord. 2553 § 4 (Exh. B3), 2009; Ord. 2447 § 36, 2005; Ord. 2301 § 2, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 7.2.1, 1996).


18.07.050 Impervious surface.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of the impervious surface standard is to provide a balance of impervious and pervious surfaces on a lot, ensuring that adequate drainage is achieved and potential runoff of the lot is controlled. Some impervious surfaces, like recreational areas, provide visual relief from the built environment and create usable open space and linked areas which are an integrated part of the project. Pervious surfaces provide scenic corridors and visual relief from the built environment and provide protection for water quality and the natural environment. Where possible, pervious surfaces should be consolidated or linked so that these areas can also function as usable open space. Impervious surface standards are defined assuming no site constraints; in actuality, there may be site constraints that prevent the permitted impervious surface to be used.

B.    Use of Pervious Areas: All required pervious areas on the site (per IMC 18.07.360, District standards table) shall be landscaped as required in this chapter. Parking or pedestrian access areas that use “pervious pavers” or pervious stormwater measures shall not be counted towards the required pervious areas of the land use district; however, stormwater regulations in Chapter 13.28 IMC require the use of pavers, paving, and/or other hard-surfaced permeable materials and other low impact development measures as the preferred and commonly used approach if feasible. Required pervious areas shall include the following areas in order of priority:

1.    Critical areas that require buffers;

2.    Existing significant tree stands;

3.    Native vegetation areas.

C.    Native Vegetation Retention Areas: All projects with native vegetation areas shall retain the following minimum of the native soil area:

1.    Twenty-five (25) percent for nonresidential uses and multifamily; and

2.    Thirty (30) percent for single family residential uses (see Chapter 18.13 IMC, Subdivisions, for requirements for platting).

D.    Impervious Surfaces: The total impervious surface of a site shall be determined by adding the square footage of all the following areas:

1.    Buildings: The footprint of the buildings and structures, except buildings with vegetated roofs or minimal excavation foundations as identified in the LID Technical Guidance Manual;

2.    Parking: The gravel and paved parking areas and driveways;

3.    Sidewalks: The gravel and paved pedestrian walkways, sidewalks and bike paths;

4.    Recreation Facilities: Decks, patios, porches, tennis courts, sport courts, pools and other similar recreation facilities;

5.    Recreation Areas: Gravel and paved picnic areas, pedestrian access and paved recreation areas;

6.    Architectural Features: 

a.    Eighteen (18) Inches or Less: Eaves and overhangs which extend past the building footprint are permitted; however, overhangs which are eighteen (18) inches or less shall not be included as impervious surface.

b.    Over Eighteen (18) Inches: Large overhangs which extend over eighteen (18) inches past the building footprint, such as cantilevered decks and other large roof extensions, shall be included in the impervious surface ratio calculation and shall not subtract the first eighteen (18) inches for the impervious surface ratio calculation. Large overhangs shall not be included as impervious if the underlying impervious surface is already being counted;

7.    Stormwater Facilities: Open, uncovered stormwater retention/detention facilities shall not be considered as impervious surfaces for the purposes of this Code;

8.    Miscellaneous: Any other structure or surface which prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil surface, or causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate from present flow rate under natural conditions prior to development shall be considered an impervious surface. For purposes of this section, grass and sod are not considered impervious surfaces.

E.    Impervious Surface Ratio: The impervious surface ratio is a measure of the proportion of the site occupied by impervious surfaces. The impervious surface ratio added to the pervious surface ratio equals one hundred (100) percent of the total gross site area.

5.    Building Permit Required: A Building Permit is required for any fence over seven (7) feet in height, or any trellis, pergola or arbor over eight (8) feet in height or with more than a forty (40) square foot footprint.

6.    Measurement: The height of a fence, trellis, pergola, arbor or wall shall be measured from whichever side of the finished grade is higher.

a.    The total height of a fence constructed on a berm (fence height plus berm height) cannot exceed the maximum height of ten (10) feet if the berm was not present. Under this provision, a berm includes a rockery or revetment.

b.    If a property owner’s fence would exceed ten (10) feet because of an existing berm, the property owner may add one (1) foot of fence height for each one and one-half (1.5) feet within the property line within which the fence is built. The intent of this provision is to allow a property owner to have a six (6) foot fence in the back yard without unduly blocking the adjacent property owner’s yard. If a fence is placed any distance within the property line, the property owner continues to be responsible for his/her property on both sides of the fence. (See Chapter 18.07 IMC, Appendix 1, for diagram).

7.    Vegetation supported by an arbor, pergola or trellis can grow over the height limit; however, sight distance requirements must be met.

C.    Preferred Materials: Wood, brick, stucco, or wrought iron are preferred fencing, arbor, pergola or trellis materials when along property side visible to the public or abutting property owners. Hedge or impenetrable landscape may be substituted for fencing, but height restrictions do not apply. Chain link fence, with landscape screening, is appropriate around major and minor utility facilities and may be appropriate in commercial districts. Screening of chain link fences ensures a compatible transition between abutting land uses and shall be effective during both winter and summer.

D.    Electric Fences: Electric fences are not permitted in any district except where additional fencing or other barriers prevent access to the electric fence by small children.

E.    Barbed Wire Fences: Barbed wire fences may be used only in the following situations:

3.    At the top of a solid or chain link fence around a major or minor utility facility.

F.    Hazardous Traffic Situation: No fence or planting may materially obstruct traffic visibility at street intersections or create a hazardous traffic situation, as required by the City’s adopted street standards.

G.    Easements: Fences on public utility or access easements shall not interfere with access or utility appurtenances. The Public Works Operations and Maintenance Department shall approve all fences on public utility or access easements prior to installation.

H.    On Top of Retaining Walls and Rockeries: Retaining walls and rockeries greater than six (6) feet shall require a three (3) foot high guardrail or fence along the top of the retaining wall or rockery. The combined height of the retaining wall and fence may not exceed ten (10) feet. If the combined height would exceed ten (10) feet, the property owner may add one (1) foot of fence height for each one and one-half (1.5) feet within the property line within which the fence is built. The intent of this provision is to allow a property owner to have a six (6) foot fence in the back yard without unduly blocking the adjacent property owner’s yard. If a fence is placed any distance within the property line, the property owner continues to be responsible for his/her property on both sides of the fence. (See Chapter 18.07 IMC, Appendix 1, for diagram). (Ord. 2687 § 3 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2587 § 3 (Exh. B2), 2010; Ord. 2562 § 4 (Exh.

18.07.290 Applicability.

Administrative adjustment of standards may include setbacks, height, or other development standards governed by Chapter 18.07 IMC, with the exception of those standards specifically prohibited for administrative adjustment. This also applies to the Downtown Sign Code, IMC 18.11.600 et seq. The following is a listing of potential development standard adjustments and the individual approval criteria. (Ord. 2152 § 3, 1997; Ord. 2108 § 7.2.18.4, 1996).


18.07.300 Height.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of this section is to allow administrative adjustment of the height standards established in IMC 18.07.360, in order to accomplish one or more of the following objectives:

1.    Enhance the architectural design by: a) modulating the roof of the structure through varied heights or pitches, or b) allowing parapets, gables, bell/clock towers or other features;

2.    Allow “subgrade” or “under building” parking;

3.    Allow floodwaters to flow beneath the structure in conformance with City and other environmental regulations.

B.    Increased Height: Building height may be increased from the base height, in any increment, up to the maximum height (District Standards Table, IMC 18.07.360), but no more than the maximum height when certain conditions are met. The approval criteria for increasing the building height up to and including fifty (50) feet are established in IMC 18.07.355(A). The approval criteria for increasing the building height up to and including fifty-eight (58) feet are established in IMC 18.07.355(B). The approval criteria for increasing building height up to and including sixty-five (65) feet are established in IMC 18.07.355(C). The approval criteria for increasing building height in the Mineral Resource Zone are established in IMC 18.07.355(D). (Ord. 2280 § 2, 2000; Ord. 2233 § 12, 1999; Ord. 2228 § 3, 1999; Ord. 2108 § 7.2.18.5, 1996).


18.07.310 Home occupation standards.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of permitting the administrative adjustment to the home occupation standards (IMC 18.07.470) is to provide for flexibility and creativity for the encouragement of appropriate home occupations.

B.    Approval Criteria: The following approval criteria, in addition to the approval criteria for a Level 2 Review, shall be used to determine whether an administrative adjustment shall be granted for home occupation standards:

1.    The adjustment(s) will be equal to, or superior in, fulfilling the intent and purpose of the home occupation standards; and

2.    The adjustment(s) does not negatively impact the adjacent property owners; and

3.    The adjustment(s) shall provide consistency with the intent, scale and character of the zoning district involved. (Ord. 2108 § 7.2.18.6, 1996).


18.07.320 Senior housing adjustment for special needs and affordable housing (housing incentives).

A.    Purpose: The purpose of permitting the Administrative Adjustment of the senior housing standards is to allow for occupancy of housing developed within senior housing standards (IMC 18.07.390) to persons with special housing needs, other than seniors, such as disabled or low income persons. This provision recognizes the relationship of “senior” occupancy to the “senior” parking standards and requires that housing for groups other than “seniors” shall meet the parking requirements for multifamily development, as established in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.050).

B.    Approval Criteria: The following criteria, in addition to the criteria for a Level 2 Review, are required in order to permit housing incentives for special housing needs and occupancy by persons other than seniors, such as disabled or low income persons:

1.    Funding: The development of the project is dependent upon funding sources which require, as a condition of funding, that provisions be made for disabled or low income persons or other population segment (other than seniors);

2.    Housing Ratio: Housing for disabled or low income persons or other segment of the population (other than seniors) may be no more than fifty (50) percent of the dwelling units within the senior housing development; 

3.    Size of Units: The units which are not designated for seniors are not limited to nine hundred fifty (950) square feet in size, however, those units over nine hundred fifty (950) square feet shall not qualify for the density bonus provisions; 

4.    Density Bonus/Parking Requirements: All units within the senior housing development, including the fifty (50) percent or less designated for other persons, may use the density bonus (IMC 18.07.390); however, only those units which are designated for “senior occupancy” are required to provide parking as established for senior housing in Table of Off-Street Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.050). Dwelling units for disabled or low income persons or other persons shall be required to provide parking requirements for multifamily development (IMC 18.09.050) unless an Administrative Adjustment for parking requirements is achieved (IMC 18.09.060);

5.    Contract Required: The units are reserved, by contract or other legal method, for the disabled or low income persons or other segment of the population (other than seniors). (Ord. 2108 § 7.2.18.7, 1996).


18.07.330 Setbacks.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of permitting the Administrative Adjustment of setback standards is to provide for flexibility in reducing or modifying setbacks in all zoning districts, without permitting a setback adjustment that would negatively impact the surrounding neighborhood. An adjustment to a setback may be approved based on a determination by the Planning Director/Manager that the adjustment is consistent with the purpose of this Code, the intent and purposes of the setback standards, and will accomplish one (1) or more of the following objectives:

1.    Allow buildings to be sited in a manner which maximizes solar access;

2.    Allow zero lot line, semidetached (common wall construction) or other types of cluster development in conformance with the provisions of this Code;

3.    Coordinate development with adjacent land uses and the physical features of the site;

4.    Permit flexibility in the design and placement of structures and other site improvements;

5.    Allow development consistent with the scale and character of the existing neighborhood;

6.    Provide flexibility for a site which has one (1) or more of the following constraints:

a.    Existing development which was permitted or platted under previous land use regulations; or

b.    A vacant site which had development approval or was platted under previous land use regulations; or

c.    Physical features of the site which prevent development that is compatible and consistent with the character and scale of the surrounding area, such as the unique site constraints in the older part of the City;

7.    Allow reduction of the required setbacks in order for the placement of the building to be adjusted on the lot for retention of existing significant trees.

B.    Approval Criteria: These setback standards are applicable in a residential, commercial, industrial or mixed use development, unless otherwise provided. These standards are not applicable to the Mineral Resource Zone. Setback standards for the Mineral Resource Zone are provided at IMC 18.07.525. These standards may be adjusted administratively through the approval of all the following criteria, in addition to the approval criteria for Level 2 Review:

1.    Compatibility: The adjustment of setbacks is compatible in scale and character with existing neighboring land uses; and

2.    Consistency: The proposed development meets all other development and design standards as governed by the District Standards Table and the Design Criteria Checklist, unless those standards are modified through approved:

a.    Cluster provisions; or

b.    An Administrative Adjustment of Standards; and

3.    Consistency with Zoning District: The adjustment of setbacks shall provide consistency with the intent and character of the zoning district involved; and

4.    Impacts:

a.    Adjacent Property Owner(s): The adjustment of setbacks does not negatively impact the adjacent property owners;

b.    Critical Areas: The adjustment of standards is consistent with the purpose and intent of the critical area regulations, and does not negatively impact any adjacent critical areas;

c.    Public Services: The adjustment of setbacks does not negatively impact public services, including emergency access, access to right-of-way, dedicated tracts, or easements; and

d.    Structure(s): Any structure(s) which is within the proposed setback modification area does not negatively impact the adjacent property through incompatible height, bulk, design, color or other feature; and

5.    Intent: The adjustment of standards will be equal to or superior in fulfilling the intent and purpose of the original requirements; and

6.    Impervious Surface Ratio: The required impervious surface area for the property is not exceeded; and

7.    Additional Approval Criteria for Front Setbacks for Commercial and Mixed Uses: All of the following additional approval criteria must be met in order to permit the modification to the front setback in commercial or mixed use developments: 

a.    The area that would have been the front setback is used for a pedestrian area, such as landscaped walkways and benches, raised planters, plazas, public art with pedestrian viewing areas and seating, or other usable pedestrian open space; and

1    Recorded plat standards and private covenants may supersede these requirements.

2    Setbacks for critical areas are established in Chapter 18.10 IMC, Environmental Protection. Setbacks for accessory uses are established in IMC 18.07.110, Accessory structures – Uninhabitable. Modification of front, rear or side setback size may be approved through administrative adjustment of standards (IMC 18.07.250). In addition, one (1) of the side lot lines may be reduced to zero (0) through a development approval (review required as listed in the Table of Permitted Land Uses) for cluster/zero lot line development, as established in the cluster development standards (IMC 18.07.420).

3    Planting areas may be required for parking lots or when abutting residential districts (see Chapter 18.12 IMC, Landscaping).

4    Impervious surface + pervious surface = one hundred (100) percent. Parking or pedestrian access areas that use “pervious pavers” or pervious stormwater measures shall not be counted towards the required pervious areas of the land use district. Required pervious areas shall include the following areas in order of priority:

1.    Critical areas that require buffers;

2.    Existing significant tree(s) or tree stands;

3.    Native vegetation areas.

5    Minimum lot width may be modified through an approved cluster proposal (IMC 18.07.420) and this District Standards Table; the required review is established in the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130).

6    Pervious surface ratio for single family residential subdivisions is calculated within the individual lots, or a “combination” of (1) within the individual lots; and (2) common area outside the subdivision plat, and not as an additional requirement of common pervious surface for the entire single family subdivision. For example, a single family home in SF-E is required to provide seventy (70) percent pervious surface on the individual single family lot; however, the subdivision plat is not required to provide seventy (70) percent pervious surface over and above the seventy (70) percent requirement for those individual lots.

7    SF-D Zone: Duplexes and/or attached single family dwellings are permitted in SF-D at a density of 14.52, which is double the density of the SF-D zone, as long as a lot is at least six thousand (6,000) sq. ft. Duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes are permitted in the SF-D zone for senior housing, at a maximum density of 14.52 plus the senior housing density bonus (IMC 18.07.390).

8    Minimum lot size for multifamily zones refers to the minimum parcel size that is required for a development in these zones. The minimum lot size does not correlate to the density, for example: 14.52 du/acre could not have two thousand four hundred (2,400) sq. ft. as the “lot size” for one (1) unit at that density because a minimum of six thousand (6,000) sq. ft. is needed for the project.

9    Front setbacks for infill projects must be compatible with existing neighborhood. Administrative adjustment of standards (Level 2 Review required) may be used to establish setbacks for a project which is compatible with the scale and character of the existing neighborhood.

10    The approval criteria for increasing the building height up to and including fifty (50) feet are established in IMC 18.07.355(A). The approval criteria for increasing the building height up to and including fifty-eight (58) feet are established in IMC 18.07.355(B). The approval criteria for increasing the building height up to and including sixty-five (65) feet are established in IMC 18.07.355(C). The approval criteria for increasing building height in the Mineral Resource Zone are established in IMC 18.07.355(D).

11    Required approval criteria for cluster housing are listed in Chapter 18.07 IMC, this District Standards Table and the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130).

12    Garage setback in an alley = twenty-four (24) foot combination of required setback on the site and (usable) alley right-of-way.

13    See community facilities description (IMC 18.07.480) for exceptions.

14    Mixed Use Projects and Nonresidential Projects in Residential Districts: (a) Nonresidential density is limited by the impervious surface ratio, height, setbacks, etc., of the underlying zoning district; (b) residential density for mixed use projects may not exceed the maximum permitted density for the underlying zoning district; (c) mixed use projects can “combine” (a) and (b) above, provided the development standards (impervious surface ratio, height, setbacks, etc.) and the maximum density for the underlying zoning district are not exceeded.

15    Through-block pedestrian connections are exempted from impervious surface calculations in the CBD zone as established in IMC 18.07.050(D).

16    Base height may increase to fifty-four (54) feet to accommodate additional first floor height such as for Retail and Service uses (at least fifteen (15) feet tall) or Office entrance lobbies or under-building parking.

18.07.390 Senior housing standards.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of requiring specific standards for senior housing is to:

1.    Provide incentives through parking requirement reductions and density bonus provisions to develop housing opportunities for persons, fifty-five (55) years of age or older, in a responsive and appropriate manner consistent with their special needs;

2.    Regulate the bulk, height, and spacing of buildings, and the circulation and parking pattern within the development in order to obtain adequate light, air, privacy, and usable open space for recreation and landscaped amenities;

3.    Provide a well designed and safe environment for seniors;

4.    Ensure that senior housing is compatible with the surrounding area and adjacent land uses.

B.    Definitions: The general term “senior housing” shall include both small scale senior housing and large scale senior housing. “Small scale senior housing” is three (3) acres or less, and “large scale senior housing” is more than three (3) acres in size.

C.    Approval Criteria: The following criteria shall be required for all senior housing development proposals:

1.    Barrier-Free Standards: Every unit within the project must be designed and built in conformance with the Uniform Building Code (UBC); the State Barrier-Free Design regulations, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA); and the current state and City regulations. 

2.    Community Space Requirements: All senior housing developments of five (5) units or more shall provide the required community space both indoors and outdoors for persons who, in some cases, may be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the development. 

a.    Indoor Space Requirements: Indoor community space shall provide a minimum of forty-eight (48) square feet per unit, in a contiguous area no smaller than two-hundred (200) square feet to include:

(1)    Seating and table space for a minimum of thirty (30) percent of the total number of units provided (for example, six (6) units would provide seating/table space for two (2) units or four (4) persons); 

(2)    Kitchen facilities, including at minimum a sink, cabinet and counter space;

(3)    A bulletin board no smaller than two (2) feet by three (3) feet. The bulletin board shall be placed in an area accessible to the residents for notice posting purposes;

(4)    Access and use consistent with Barrier-Free Standards.

b.    Outdoor Space Requirements: The provision for outdoor community space provides that usable open space for senior housing is provided to the residents. Area used for outdoor community space shall be calculated as part of the impervious surface for the proposal, and not considered an additional requirement. The hard-scape material shall be considered as impervious surface, in addition to any other areas of the outdoor space which is impervious. Outdoor community space shall provide a minimum of forty-eight (48) square feet per unit, in a contiguous area no smaller than two hundred (200) square feet:

(1)    Seating space for a minimum of thirty (30) percent of the total number of units provided (for example, six (6) units would provide seating/table space for two (2) units or four (4) persons);

(2)    Landscaping integrated with the seating and table area. Not less than thirty (30) percent of the outdoor community space shall be landscaped with plant materials, while the remaining seventy (70) percent can be hard-scape materials which are barrier-free such as pavers, textured concrete, and brick;

(3)    Access consistent with Barrier-Free Standards.

3.    Density Bonus Provisions: In those zoning districts where senior housing developments are permitted (Table of Permitted Land Uses, IMC 18.06.130), the density bonus provision may be used to increase the density above the base density allowed in the zoning district by one-third (1/3) unit for every unit up to nine hundred fifty (950) square feet, and by two-thirds (2/3) unit for every unit up to seven hundred (700) square feet (See Table 18.07.390 – Senior Housing Standards). For example, a site with six (6) nine hundred (900) square foot units allowed by zoning would be permitted to have two (2) extra units (one-third (1/3) unit for each of the six (6) units) for a total of eight (8) units on the site; provided the following approval criteria are met: 

a.    Occupancy: The entire project must be reserved for senior occupancy; and

b.    Size: Both the proposed unit and the resultant additional unit each have no more than nine hundred fifty (950) square feet of gross floor area per dwelling unit, excluding decks and storage/shed areas. 

4.    Covenant Required: The occupancy requirements for the individual senior housing units and the entire project, where density bonus provisions are used, are to be guaranteed by an acceptable covenant or land use agreement between the owner and the City. The covenant or land use agreement shall remain in effect for the life of the structure. If the use of the property should change to a use other than senior housing, the property shall revert to its underlying zoning and density restrictions; parking requirements and any existing structure shall be brought into conformance to the underlying zoning.

5.    Occupancy: Occupancy of senior housing units is restricted to persons fifty-five (55) years of age or older with the following exceptions:

a.    A spouse under fifty-five (55) years of age married to one over fifty-five (55) years of age.

b.    Nonmotorized: Pedestrian walkways shall be provided within a project and as linkages to adjacent projects.

8.    Building Modulation: Building modulation is intended to break up the overall bulk and mass of the exterior of a multifamily building, including townhouses. Modulation should also add character to the overall building exterior as well as to individual units. 

a.    Building facade modulation should occur at every twenty-five (25) feet of wall length. The modulation can take the form of decks, balconies, indentations, extrusions and other various forms; and 

b.    Minimum modulation depth shall be approximately three (3) feet; and

c.    Minimum modulation width shall be approximately eight (8) feet.

9.    Roofline Variation: Roof line variation is intended to break up the overall bulk and mass of a multifamily building and to provide a visual relief as viewed against the skyline. Roof line variation shall occur on all multifamily structures with roof lines which exceed fifty (50) feet in length. Roof line variation shall be achieved using one (1) or more of the following methods:

a.    Vertical off-set ridge line;

b.    Horizontal off-set ridge line;

c.    Variations of roof pitch; or

d.    Any other technique approved by the Planning Director/Manager which achieves the intent of this section.

b.    Structures: Screening of structures from adjacent properties shall be provided, such as landscaping, fences, berms or other similar materials and/or designs. (Ord. 2301 § 2, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 7.4.3, 1996).


18.07.400 Reasonable accommodation.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The Federal Fair Housing Act (FFHA) requires that reasonable accommodations be made in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Planning Director/Manager is therefore authorized to make accommodations in the provisions of this Code as applied to dwellings occupied or to be occupied by persons with disabilities as defined in the Federal Fair Housing Act, when the Planning Director/Manager determines that such accommodations reasonably may be necessary in order to comply with such Act.

B.    Applicability: The Planning Director/Manager may grant reasonable accommodation to individuals with disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 3602, in order for them to live in a household of more than five (5) persons according the following procedure. 

C.    Procedure: 

1.    A grant of reasonable accommodation is governed by Level 0 Review (Chapter 18.04 IMC). An applicant for reasonable accommodation must demonstrate that the disability of the proposed residents makes it necessary for them to live in a household of the size proposed in order to have equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

2.    A determination shall be made regarding what adverse land use impacts, including cumulative impacts, if any, would result from granting the proposed accommodation. This determination shall take into account the size, shape and location of the dwelling unit and lot; the traffic and parking conditions on adjoining and neighboring streets; vehicle usage to be expected from the residents, staff and visitors; and any other circumstances determined to be relevant.

3.    The applicant’s need for accommodation shall be considered in light of the anticipated land use impacts, and conditions may be imposed in order to make the accommodation reasonable in light of those impacts.

4.    A grant of reasonable accommodation permits a dwelling to be inhabited only according to the terms and conditions of the applicant’s proposal and the Planning Director/Manager’s decision. If it is determined that the accommodation has become unreasonable because circumstances have changed or adverse land use impacts have occurred that were not anticipated, the Planning Director/Manager shall rescind or modify the decision to grant reasonable accommodation.

5.    A decision to grant reasonable accommodation shall be recorded with the King County Division of Records and Elections.

6.    Nothing herein shall prevent the Planning Director/Manager from granting reasonable accommodation to the full extent required by federal or state law. (Ord. 2108 § 7.4.4, 1996).


18.07.410 Single family standards.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of these supplemental standards for single family residential development is to achieve lot size reduction to protect the natural environment and encourage economically viable subdivisions. The intent of these standards is to encourage a sense of community within each residential development while protecting the surrounding environment. These supplemental standards are not intended to alter the underlying zoning or density provision of the subject site; however, the potential for lot size reduction as designated in the District Standards Table (IMC 18.07.360) provides for more usable open space in common areas outside of the platted subdivision as well as preserving critical areas and their buffers as pervious surface outside of the platted subdivision.

B.    Permitted Locations and Review Required: The permitted locations and review required for these supplemental standards applicable to single family development and manufactured housing are governed by the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130). Approval of a development with these supplemental standards does not alter the underlying zoning or density provisions of the subject site. (Ord. 2108 § 7.4.5, 1996).


18.07.420 Cluster housing standards.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of the cluster housing standards is to:

1.    Achieve the maximum allowable density, as established on the District Standards Table (IMC 18.07.360), on developable land while preserving critical areas and other pervious surfaces through lot size reduction;

2.    Provide more common usable and native forested open space within cluster developments that are not a part of a platted lot;

3.    Encourage affordable housing through the provision of smaller lots; and

4.    Provide a more efficient arrangement of structures for providing services and infrastructure.

A cluster development may include, but is not limited to, zero lot line units, manufactured homes, duplex, triplex and fourplex units.

B.    Approval Criteria: The provisions for lot size adjustment are defined within the District Standards Table (IMC 18.07.360). Review for cluster development approval shall occur within the existing procedure required for the application. Approval for a cluster development shall be granted only if all the following criteria are met:

1.    Minimum Area: A minimum of two (2) acres is required for a cluster development; however, there is no minimum lot size for individual units within the development.

2.    Density: Overall density must not exceed density of underlying zoning district.

3.    Consistency with Policies: The proposed development will be consistent with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and standards of the Comprehensive Plan, the City’s subdivision regulations (Chapter 18.13 IMC), this Code and all other pertinent rules or regulations, whether local, state or federal.

4.    Development Standards: Required development and design standards for cluster housing are established in the District Standards Table (IMC 18.07.360), and based upon the underlying district standards for the parcel.

a.    Critical Areas: When critical areas are present, such critical areas and their buffers shall be used to calculate the pervious surface requirement. Environmentally constrained land shall not be used for subdivision of individual lots, and shall be held in a critical area tract or other protection method.

b.    Common Usable Open Space: The cluster development shall have a minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the net site area as common usable open space.

c.    Setbacks at exterior site boundaries, where the zoning is different than the abutting zoning, shall be the greater of the setback required by the site’s zoning or the setback required by the adjacent zoning. There are no minimum interior setbacks, except those established by other requirements, such as building code, easements and critical areas. 

d.    Pervious and impervious surface requirements are equal to underlying zone for the gross site, prior to subdivision or other actions. There are no minimum requirements for pervious and impervious ratios on individual lots within the cluster development.

5.    Landscape Plan: Residential projects developed as a cluster development (this section) shall be required to submit a landscape plan per IMC 18.12.070 and a Building Permit(s) shall not be issued until the landscaping plan has been approved. The landscaping plan shall be fully detailed as required by the provisions of the landscaping chapter and shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Director/Manager. Minimum standards for cluster development projects shall include:

a.    Landscaping of all building setbacks and internal areas between buildings except for ingress and egress (driveways and sidewalks) shall be as required for multifamily residential uses in IMC 18.12.070, Schedule – General requirements by landscape type.

b.    Landscaping on the exterior periphery yards of a cluster development project shall include a combination of coniferous and deciduous trees, shrubs and ground cover.

c.    The minimum pervious area established by the underlying zone of the clustered development shall be fully landscaped. Critical areas and their associated buffers (i.e., steep slopes, wetlands, etc.) retained or recreated as native forest may count towards the required pervious area and need not be landscaped. Enhancement of those critical areas, including critical area buffers, may be required if they are counted towards required buffering.

6.    Impacts:

a.    Neighborhood: The proposed clustering of the development will not have a substantial adverse impact on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood or community, traffic conditions, parking, utility facilities, or other elements affecting the public health, safety and general welfare.

b.    Environment: The proposed cluster development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any scenic corridor or Issaquah Treasure as identified in the City’s Comprehensive Plan.

c.    Services: The proposed cluster development will be adequately served by essential public facilities and services (such as highways, streets, parking spaces, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water, sewers and schools) or the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use will adequately provide for such services.

7.    Implementation:

a.    Unit Types: Developments proposed under the cluster provision may use the zero lot line provision, single family semidetached (common wall) units or other methods or combinations, provided all the approval criteria established for those housing types and cluster development approval criteria are met.

b.    More Than One (1) Zoning District: A development which includes more than one (1) zoning district may use the cluster provision and may site the clustered units in one (1) or all zoning districts within the development. Overall density of the cluster development cannot be more than the combined total for all included district properties. However, units can be sited in one (1) or all zoning districts.

8.    Zero Lot Line Standards: The following are additional approval criteria for zero lot line cluster development:

a.    Lot Coverage/Impervious Surface: The impervious surface on the original parcel before subdividing shall not exceed those standards established in the District Standards Table (IMC 18.07.360).

b.    Maintenance and Drainage Easements: A perpetual easement at least five (5) feet wide for maintenance, eaves overhang, and drainage shall be provided on the lot adjacent to the zero lot line property line which, with the exception of walls and/or fences, shall be kept clear of structures. This easement shall be shown on the plat and incorporated into each deed transferring title of the property. The wall shall be maintained in its original color and treatment unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the two (2) affected lot owners. Eaves, but no other part of any structure, may protrude across a side lot line, and such protrusion shall not exceed eighteen (18) inches. Water runoff from the dwelling placed on the lot line is limited to the easement areas. An alternative to having an easement on the adjacent lot is to set back the dwelling unit two (2) to five (5) feet from the lot line so access can occur on each lot, and then give the adjacent lot use of this area through an easement in the setback area.

c.    Platting Requirements: Each dwelling shall be located on its own individual platted lot. The final plat or short plat shall provide a plan, drawn to scale as required by the current subdivision regulations within this Code (Chapter 18.13 IMC), indicating the exact location and building footprint of all structures proposed to encroach within the required setback, the zero lot lines, and the related easements.

d.    Setbacks: See IMC 18.07.360, District standards table.

C.    Development Agreement: A Development Agreement must be approved by the City Council prior to or concurrently with a plat decision and/or other land use decision located on commonly owned, contiguous parcels of land totaling five (5) or more acres of land. Upon City Council approval of a Development Agreement, the property’s development shall be governed by the substantive provisions of the approved Development Agreement and implemented through subdivisions, short plats, binding site plans or other applicable permits in accordance with the procedures specified in the Development Agreement, or standard City procedures if none are specified in the Development Agreement. Any conditions or standards of approval for any subdivision, short plat, binding site plan or other permit or approval for the property shall use and incorporate the development standards set forth in the approved Development Agreement.

1.    Each Development Agreement approved by the City Council shall include the following components:

a.    Project description and conceptual site plan;

b.    Open space and recreation lands and facilities, including preservation of critical areas and buffers;

c.    Residential uses, densities and affordable housing;

d.    Site design, bulk and/or building standards;

e.    Capital facilities plan showing infrastructure such as road improvements, transportation management plans, utilities, schools, police and fire and any other public services or facilities.

2.    A property owner with less than five (5) acres has the option of doing a Development Agreement as part of the cluster development, but it is not required.

3.    A Development Agreement may deviate from the underlying district standards identified in the Land Use Code in order to achieve the components listed above. However, density and permitted uses cannot differ from the underlying zoning standards.

4.    Any redevelopment that occurs shall follow the requirements of the underlying zoning district unless the existing Development Agreement is amended and approved by the City Council or unless a new Development Agreement is approved by the City Council under the regulations of this Code. (Ord. 2525 § 3, 2008; Ord. 2501 § 18, 2007; Ord. 2497 § 3, 2007; Ord. 2491 § 8, 2007; Ord. 2462 § 28, 2006; Ord. 2447 § 42, 2005; Ord. 2301 § 2, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 7.4.6, 1996).

E.    Pre-HUD Manufactured Homes: Pre-HUD manufactured homes (mobile homes) are not allowed as permanent residences within the City because, as defined, they were built before the Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, and do not bear the insignia of HUD. Pre-HUD manufactured homes approved as permanent residences within the City prior to the effective date of this Code are exempt. (Ord. 2553 § 4 (Exh. B3), 2009; Ord. 2108 § 7.4.7, 1996).


18.07.440 Multifamily and duplex development standards.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of requiring specific standards for multifamily and duplex development are to:

1.    Ensure multifamily and duplex residential development which is compatible with the scale and character of the neighborhood or community in which it is located;

2.    Provide a safe source of housing for residents of the City which includes amenities such as usable open space;

3.    Provide the opportunity for urbanized lifestyles that would be located close to a range of urban services; 

4.    Encourage a sense of community within each cluster and within each overall development; and

5.    Provide that impacts to public services and facilities are mitigated.

B.    Diversity: 

1.    Unit Type: Diversity of unit types is encouraged, including, but not limited to, senior housing, special needs and the low income rental market as defined by current King County Standards [Countywide Planning Policies]; 

2.    Location: Multifamily shall be considered a desirable component of mixed use developments and shall be encouraged.

C.    Permitted Locations and Review Required: The permitted locations and review required for multifamily and duplex development are governed by the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130). 

D.    Approval Criteria: Approval for all proposals for multifamily or duplex developments shall be permitted only if all the following approval criteria are met:

b.    Nonmotorized: Pedestrian walkways shall be provided within a project and as linkages to adjacent projects.

2.    Building Modulation: Building modulation shall occur on all multifamily structures, including townhouses and residential development associated with residential mixed use development and is intended to break up the overall bulk and mass of the exterior of a multifamily building. Modulation should also add character to the overall building exterior as well as to individual units. 

a.    Building facade modulation should occur at every twenty-five (25) feet of wall length. The modulation can take the form of decks, balconies, indentations, extrusions and other various forms; and 

b.    Minimum modulation depth shall be approximately three (3) feet; and

c.    Minimum modulation width shall be approximately eight (8) feet.

3.    Duplex and Attached Single Family/Townhouse Standards:

a.    Duplexes and attached single family dwellings/townhouses located in established single family residential neighborhoods shall be designed and built to be compatible with the existing character of the neighborhood. Compatibility of design shall include but is not limited to:

(1)    Resembling the character, style and modulation of a single family unit; and

(2)    Resembling or consistent with the time period in which the majority of the homes in the surrounding neighborhood were built; and

(3)    Having a height and scale that is consistent with the existing single family homes in the neighborhood.

b.    No duplex or attached single family/townhouse dwelling shall have a firewall and/or parapet extension above the roofline (see the International Building Code (IBC) for options on allowed roof construction types).

c.    The maximum number of single family dwellings/townhouses that may be attached in a single grouping varies by zoning district and is determined in IMC 18.06.130, Table of Permitted Land Uses.

d.    Before any attached single family unit is permitted in the SF-D Single Family – Duplex District on a lot between three thousand (3,000) and six thousand (6,000) square feet, the owner shall be required to record a covenant in a form approved by the City which will require the building location on the lot with only one side at zero (0) feet setback, limit the right to only one attached single family housing unit per three thousand (3,000) square feet of lot area, prohibit building a detached housing unit, prohibit an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) and grant access easements as may be needed for maintenance of an adjoining unit.

4.    Parking: Parking shall be determined for multifamily developments, as established in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.050).

5.    Private or Common Usable Outdoor Space: Every multifamily development, including townhouses, shall provide private outdoor space for individual units or a larger common, outdoor space for the residences. The purpose of requiring usable open space is to provide this amenity for the residents of these developments. The usable outdoor space, whether provided on an individual or community basis, may consist of pervious and impervious surfaces. For the purpose of calculating the impervious surface ratio, those areas of the outdoor space which are impervious shall be counted as impervious surface. 

a.    Common Outdoor Space: Common outdoor space shall be provided in the form of one or several outdoor balconies, patios, decks or gardens. Common outdoor space shall be easily accessible to all residents of the complex and no common outdoor space shall be attached to any individual unit.

b.    Containment of Activity Areas: Activity areas shall be designed so that they do not interfere with incompatible on-site uses; for example, children’s play areas shall not overflow into parking lots or pedestrian pathways.

b.    Structures: Screening of structures from adjacent properties shall be provided, such as landscaping, fences, berms or other similar materials and/or designs. (Ord. 2471 § 5, 2006; Ord. 2108 § 7.4.8, 1996).

Accessory Uses – Residential Standards


18.07.450 Accessory dwelling units (ADUs).

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of this section is to permit, according to the specific criteria, a secondary living unit that is either located within or detached from the primary residence in certain zones. Specifically, this provision is intended to:

1.    Create affordable housing options;

2.    Foster and support extended families; and

3.    Allow family members, primarily older adults, to live independently at a reduced cost.

B.    Review Required: An application for an ADU requires a Level 0 review as established in the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130).

1.    Covenant: An ADU shall be subject to the applicant recording a property covenant with the King County Department of Records and Elections. A copy of the recorded information shall be returned to the Permit Center within ten (10) days of recording. A final inspection for a new ADU will not be granted without a copy of the information recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections. The recorded information shall:

a.    Identify the address of the property;

b.    State that the owner(s) resides in either the principal dwelling unit or the ADU;

c.    Include a statement that the owner(s) will notify any prospective purchasers of the limitations of this chapter; and

d.    Provide for the removal of the ADU if any of the requirements of this chapter are violated.

2.    Grandfathering of Existing Dwellings:

a.    If an ADU was created without being part of a project for which a building permit was finalized, the City shall require a building inspection to determine if the structure is sound, will not pose a hazard to people or property, and meets the requirements of this section and building code.

b.    A pre-existing ADU shall be subject to the applicant recording a property covenant with the King County Department of Records and Elections. A copy of the recorded information shall be returned to the Permit Center within ten (10) days of recording. The recorded information shall:

(1)    Identify the address of the property;

(2)    State that the owner(s) resides in either the principal dwelling unit or the ADU;

(3)    Include a statement that the owner(s) will notify any prospective purchasers of the limitations of this chapter; and

(4)    Provide for the removal of the ADU if any of the requirements of this chapter are violated.

c.    Reinstating an ADU: The owner of a building in which an ADU previously existed and was removed may reinstate an ADU provided the City Building Official determines through a building inspection that the ADU is sound, does not pose a hazard to people or property, and meets the requirements of this section and the building code. The ADU inspection fee will cover the building inspection of the ADU.

3.    Utilities: The review of utility connections (water, gas, and electric) shall be done by the Development Services Department. Accessory dwelling units may be served by one (1) connection and one (1) meter as long as fixture count and fire flow demands can be met.

4.    Elimination: Elimination of an approved ADU may be accomplished by the owner filing a letter of intent with the Development Services Department followed by an inspection to ensure the power source to the cooking unit has been removed. Elimination of the ADU shall be subject to the applicant removing the property covenant with the King County Department of Records and Elections. A copy of the recorded information shall be returned to the Permit Center within ten (10) days of recording. An inspection will not be granted without a copy of the information recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections. Elimination of an ADU also may occur as a result of an enforcement action. The letter of intent shall:

a.    Identify the address of the property;

b.    State that the owner(s) resides in the principal dwelling unit;

c.    Include a statement that the owner(s) will notify any future purchasers of said property the limitations of this chapter if the new owners wish to reinstate the ADU.

C.    Approval Criteria:

1.    Location: ADUs shall be allowed in single family units located in permitted zones as established in the Table of Permitted Land Uses; provided the units meet all of the approval criteria. An ADU may be located in a single family unit or in a detached structure on a single family lot.

2.    Number: Only one (1) accessory dwelling unit will be permitted for one (1) single family detached or attached dwelling unit on its own legal lot. For example, one (1) single family dwelling unit cannot have one (1) ADU in the dwelling unit and one (1) ADU above the garage. Single family dwelling units that are on legally nonconforming lots may also be permitted one (1) accessory dwelling unit.

3.    Occupancy: The principal dwelling unit or the ADU must be occupied by an owner of the property or a family member of the property owner. Owner occupancy is defined, for the purposes of this section, as a property owner, as reflected in title records, who makes his or her legal residence at the site, as evidenced by filing an affidavit with the King County Department of Records and Elections and who actually resides at the site more than six (6) months out of any given calendar year.

4.    Size: The square footage of the ADU shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet, excluding any nonliving areas such as garage area, storage sheds, or decks, unless the excluded area is the location of the proposed ADU. The Development Services Director or designated appointee may allow increased size if the creation of the ADU does not necessitate an exterior expansion of the residence, except for minimal alterations necessary for the ADU to be a functional separate residence.

5.    Design and Construction Standards:

a.    Additions to an existing structure or newly constructed detached structure created for the purpose of developing an ADU shall be designed to conform with all applicable development standards. One (1) ADU door may be constructed on the front or street side of the residence; provided, that it is screened from the street or the visual impact is otherwise mitigated. A four (4) foot wide walkway shall be constructed from the address side of the right-of-way or driveway to the ADU primary entrance. Minimum walkway requirements (four (4) feet) will not be counted against the site’s maximum impervious surface calculation.

b.    Existing legally nonconforming structures may be used for the locating of an ADU if the Building Official determines that the structure is sound, will not pose a hazard to people or property, and meets the requirements of this section and building code requirements. Portions of buildings that undergo a change of use are required to meet building codes for new construction in compliance with the current building code.

6.    Parking: Adequate parking must be provided on site for the single family detached dwelling, and for the ADU as specified in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.050) unless otherwise approved through a permit review. Tandem parking can be used to fulfill this requirement.

7.    Home Occupations and ADUs: The ADU and/or primary residence may contain a home occupation(s) if the home occupation(s) is reviewed and approved as regulated by IMC 18.07.470. (Ord. 2839 § 10, 2018; Ord. 2562 § 4 (Exh. B3), 2009; Ord. 2301 § 2, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 7.4.9, 1996).

18.07.470 Home occupations.

A.    Purpose: The conduct of business within a dwelling may be permitted in residential and commercial districts under the provisions of this section as long as the home occupation is consistent with the existing character of the surrounding neighborhood as defined by the approval criteria. Using the approval criteria, it is the intent of this section to:

1.    Maintain and preserve the character of residential neighborhoods;

2.    Ensure the compatibility of home occupations with other uses permitted in the residential districts;

3.    Promote the efficient use of public services and facilities while assuring that commercial users do not reduce the City’s public services and facilities level of service to intended residential users;

4.    Encourage flexibility in the work place and creativity in careers by permitting home occupations; and

5.    Regulate home occupations because of the potential impact to the surrounding neighborhood.

B.    Table of Permitted Home Occupations: Table 18.07.470, “Table of Permitted Home Occupations,” is incorporated into this section. Each permitted home occupation listed in this table and located at the end of this section is designated as a permitted use which requires a Level 0 (Business License Review), 1, or 2 for a particular residential zoning district. All permitted home occupations are subject to the standards of this Code and the applicable review procedures. Specific uses not permitted as home occupations are also listed in this section.

C.    Approval Criteria: Home occupations are permitted as an accessory use to the residential use of the dwelling or approved detached building when all of the criteria are met. An Administrative Adjustment of Standards may be applied for, in accordance with IMC 18.07.310, if any of the criteria cannot be met. The approval criteria for home occupations are as follows:

1.    Accessory Use: The home occupation is incidental and subordinate to the primary use of the structure as a dwelling. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the gross floor area of the residence or accessory building (up to five hundred (500) square feet) may be used for the home occupation. A family day care center or adult family home shall not be limited to five hundred (500) square feet within the home; however, it shall follow any size limitation designated by the State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS).

2.    Buffers Needed: The following home occupations shall have enough acreage to ensure adequate buffers so that the neighborhood is not negatively impacted. Buffering shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director/Manager, given the proposed extent of the home occupation and the size and characteristics of the specific parcel:

a.    Commercial hobby farms;

b.    Kennels; or

c.    Animal breeding.

3.    Business License Required: No person shall carry on a home occupation, or permit such use to occur on property which he/she owns or is in lawful control, without first obtaining a Business License.

4.    Family Day Care Centers and Adult Family Homes: Family day care center and adult family home operators shall obtain all applicable licenses, registrations and permits from the State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). Proof of State licensing shall be required to obtain a City of Issaquah Business License.

5.    Electrical Equipment: The home occupation does not require the use of electrical equipment that exceeds typical standards for residential use.

6.    Employees: The home occupation is conducted primarily by family members residing in the dwelling.

7.    Environmental Impacts: The home occupation shall not negatively affect any aspect of the environment.

8.    External Alterations: There are no external alterations to the building which change its character from a residential dwelling.

9.    Fire Rating: The home occupation does not require the use of electrical or mechanical equipment that would change the fire rating of the structure.

10.    Kennels and Animal Breeding: All kennels and animal breeding facilities that are developed after the effective date of this Code shall provide only indoor boarding facilities. If overnight boarding services are provided, the facilities must be soundproofed to minimize noise impacts to the surrounding properties.

11.    Outside Storage or Display: There is no outside storage or display of any kind related to the home occupation. Play equipment for day care operations is not considered outdoor storage or display.

12.    Primary Residence: The home occupation is conducted inside a dwelling, or inside an approved detached building to a dwelling, which is the primary residence of the principal practitioner.

13.    Production Line Equipment Not Permitted: Automated or production line equipment shall not be used at the home occupation site. All stock in trade that is produced on-site for resale purposes must be produced by hand.

14.    Residential Character: The business is conducted in a manner that will not alter the normal residential character of the premises by the use of color, materials, lighting and signs, or the emission of noise, vibration, dust, glare, heat, smoke or odors. In addition, the refuse/recycling location and container sizing for the single family home shall continue according to the residential requirements. 

15.    Sign/Nameplates: A nameplate may display the name of occupant and/or the name of the home occupation (e.g., John Jones, Accountant). The nameplate shall be attached to the dwelling and shall not exceed two (2) square feet in area. The nameplate shall be compatible with the architectural character of the neighborhood and shall not be illuminated or backlit. Only one (1) nameplate shall be allowed. In cases where the home is not visible from the street, the nameplate may be placed near the road on the owner’s property, but not in the right-of-way.

16.    Traffic Trips: The home occupation, by itself, shall not generate more than twenty (20) vehicular trips a day except that home day cares may have as many trips as required for the number of allowed children per the State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) requirements. As used here, a trip is considered either the arrival or the departure of a vehicle from the household. For example, one (1) vehicle making a delivery and then leaving immediately would be considered two (2) trips.

17.    Water/Sewer Use: The home occupation does not increase water or sewer use so that the combined total use for the dwelling and home occupation is significantly more than the average for residences in the neighborhood.

18.    Additional Conditions: In granting approval for a home occupation, the City may attach additional conditions to ensure the home occupation will not be detrimental to the character of the residential neighborhood. Any home occupation authorized under the provisions of this Code shall be open to inspection and review at all reasonable times by an authorized City official for purposes of verifying compliance with the approval criteria and other Code provisions.

D.    Review Required: Application and review for all proposed home occupations shall be required as governed by the Table of Permitted Home Occupations, Table 18.07.470. Proposals for home occupations which are not listed in this table shall be reviewed by the Planning Director/Manager, and processed through the level review deemed appropriate by the Planning Director/Manager. An Administrative Adjustment of Standards may be permitted for home occupations if the applicant meets the approval criteria for the Administrative Adjustment. The Planning Director/Manager may forward the home occupation application to the Hearing Examiner for review if, in the sole discretion of the Director/Manager, the proposal merits a different level of review.

E.    Home Occupations Not Permitted: The following uses, by the nature of their operation or investment, have a pronounced tendency, once started, to increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations; are otherwise incompatible with residential areas; and impair the use and value of a residentially zoned area for residential purposes. Therefore, the uses listed below shall not be permitted as home occupations:

1.    Repair, building, or servicing of vehicles or boats;

2.    Antique shop or gift shop;

9.    Recreational marijuana facilities;

10.    Marijuana cooperatives;

11.    Uses which may include hazardous chemicals or other items which may potentially be hazardous to the surrounding area. 

F.    Denial of Application for a Home Occupation: An application for a home occupation shall be denied if the Planning Director/Manager finds that the application fails to comply with the provisions of this section. The Planning Director/Manager shall state the specific reasons for denial of a home occupation, and shall cite the specific provisions and sections of this Code on which the denial is based. The Planning Director/Manager’s decision is final unless appealed, pursuant to this chapter.

G.    Annual Review: An annual review of a home occupation may be an approval condition. This review by the Planning Director/Manager shall include an assessment to ensure the home occupation is in compliance with the original approval criteria. If the review indicates that the home occupation is not being conducted according to the approval criteria, or the use has become detrimental to the residential neighborhood, the approval of the home occupation shall be revoked and enforcement action taken, or shall have conditional approval after the situation has been addressed and corrected.

H.    Elimination of Home Occupation: If a home occupation is not being conducted according to the approval criteria, or the use has become detrimental to the residential neighborhood, the home occupation shall not be permitted to continue unless the situation has been addressed and corrected. 

I.    Exceptions: The following activities which do not exceed three (3) days in duration or do not operate for more than nine (9) days in any one (1) calendar year shall be exempt from the requirements of this section:

Nonresidential Standards


18.07.480 Community facilities standards.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of requiring specific standards for community facility buildings and structures or land uses are:

1.    Compatibility of Land Uses: Establish general standards regarding aesthetics, height, and other development standards for community facilities which will ensure compatibility of design, construction and scale, and minimize the impact of these facilities with surrounding uses. 

2.    Provision of Service: Establish general standards to ensure that the public is provided with safe and functional community facilities. 

3.    Comprehensive Plan Implementation: Provide for community facility improvements and additions necessary to meet local and regional needs and implement Issaquah’s Comprehensive Plan.

4.    Compact Facilities: Allow for the siting of public buildings more efficiently as the City continues to densify.

B.    Applicability: Community facilities are subject to the review procedures identified in the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130) and shall be permitted when the approval criteria established in this section are met.

C.    Approval of Community Facilities Prior to Legislative Rezone: A community facility land use may be permitted in zoning designations other than community facilities as allowed in this Code (Table of Permitted Uses, IMC 18.06.130). The site may subsequently be reviewed for a legislative rezone to community facilities through the annual update of the Comprehensive Plan.

D.    Approval Criteria – Public Utility Facilities:

1.    Architectural Form and Character: A public building that houses all or a majority of a public utility facility must be compatible with the architectural standards of the area or subarea within which it is located, whichever is more restrictive.

a.    Exceptions – Significant Elements: Compatibility of architectural form is not applicable to a utility facility where significant elements of the facility are not housed in a building; however, screening is required to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses.

b.    Exceptions – Isolated Elements: Compatibility of architectural form is not applicable for isolated minor elements such as pad-mounted transformers, telephone pedestals and metering stations; however, screening is required as established in this section, to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses.

2.    Development Standards: All minor utility facilities and those major utility facilities that are not intended for occupancy shall conform to development standards including setback, height standards, and impervious surface of the most restrictive contiguous zoning district as established in IMC 18.07.360, District standards table.

3.    Height: Public utility structures such as communication towers and water storage tanks shall be designed so as to be the lowest height possible to adequately serve the needs of the utility and shall comply with Chapter 18.22 IMC, Wireless Communication Facilities (WCF).

4.    Undergrounding: Public utility facilities such as communication facilities shall be installed underground or within buildings to the greatest extent practical in order to maximize safety and minimize visual and noise impacts upon surrounding properties. Public utility facilities such as distribution lines should also be installed underground in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

5.    Comprehensive Plan Compliance: The proposed public utility facility shall be consistent with:

a.    The need to serve the land use patterns and densities contemplated in the land use element of the Comprehensive Plan and, if applicable, the King County Comprehensive Plan;

b.    The public service obligations of the servicing utility and its ability to provide service throughout its system;

c.    The utilities and public services element of the Comprehensive Plan, including the goals and policies adopted therein and utility element map(s) showing the general location and capacity of all existing and proposed utility facilities.

6.    Environmental Impacts: The existing natural environment of the area shall be identified, along with impacts of the proposed facility upon the natural environment, and what shall be required as mitigation.

7.    Maintenance: Long term maintenance requirements shall be identified, funding options shall be noted, and a long term maintenance program shall be provided.

8.    Noise: No machinery or equipment may cause noise beyond established state standards, as measured at the property line, electrical interference or similar disturbances.

9.    Residential Areas:

a.    Impacts: Public utility facilities shall, whenever possible, be located and designed to minimize adverse impacts on adjacent residential properties;

b.    Storage: In residential zones, outdoor storage of public utility related vehicles or any outdoor storage of public utility related materials outside the public utility buildings or structures must be screened from adjacent properties.

10.    Screening: The public utility facility shall be screened to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses. Public utility facilities such as transformers, regulator stations, substations and other such mechanical structures shall be screened with landscaping and/or other such material that provides screening during the entire year.

a.    Economic Analysis: Costs associated with the use of each alternative site shall be established, including appraised value, acquisition costs, neighborhood impacts, and the intrinsic value of the open space to the neighborhood, City, and natural resources of the area.

b.    Natural Resource Analysis/Assessment: The analysis shall be conducted for site alternatives located within the CF-OS zone and shall generally include an analysis of the site’s geologic, biological, scenic and visual, cultural/archaeological, water quantity and quality, and recreational resource values. The analysis shall:

(1)    Address and demonstrate how the project proposal will affect the aforementioned natural resources individually or cumulatively;

(2)    Evaluate potential impacts to habitat types of sufficient size necessary to support any species present;

(3)    Demonstrate how habitat corridors with adequate cover and width to allow for unrestricted movement of animals between areas of intact habitat shall be maintained;

(4)    Evaluate the impacts of locating land uses adjacent to habitat types and corridors that require minimal disruption of the needs of species present in the habitat type through direct or indirect means.

c.    Watershed Protection Analysis: Because the CF-OS zones within the City are located within the watershed of a salmon bearing creek, the alternative analysis report shall:

(1)    Prepare and include an appropriate plan to protect listed or threatened species present (e.g., chinook, salmon and bull trout);

(2)    Provide for the long term protection of aquatic species;

(3)    Require the maintenance of habitat forming processes including delivery/routing of sediment, delivery/routing of water quantity, delivery/routing of woody debris and delivery/routing of carbon;

(4)    Generally provide an analysis of potential impact on streams within the watershed where anadromous fish are present;

(5)    Use watershed planning tools such as the river basin characterization methodology.

d.    Mitigation Measures: The alternative analysis report shall suggest mitigation measures as reviewed at the project review meeting, to offset the negative impacts associated with the project development. These mitigation measures shall be addressed in the normal project/permit review process.

12.    Multiple Uses on a Site Zoned Community Facility: If a site is zoned Community Facilities and either is or has the potential for multiple uses to be located upon the site, the project review meeting will provide notification to the affected boards and commissions including, but not limited to, the Cemetery Board and the Park Board.

E.    Approval Criteria, Nonutility Community Facilities Including Public Buildings: Development, including retail/commercial uses, is permitted in community facilities only when all of the following criteria are met and as permitted in the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130). Accessory retail/commercial uses are permitted as allowed in the accessory use criteria in the Land Use Code.

1.    Architectural Form and Character: Community facility public buildings must meet all applicable design requirements of the subarea in which they are located, and shall:

a.    Be efficiently sited to use the smallest possible footprint;

Footnotes:

1    Floor Area Ratio: The relationship between the amount of gross floor area in a building (or buildings) and the developable site area on which the building(s) stands. It is obtained by dividing the gross floor area of a building by the developable site area. Structured, underbuilding, and surface parking are not included in the gross floor area calculation.

	Gross Floor Area of a Building(s)	 = FAR

	Developable Site Area

2    Setbacks for critical areas are established in Chapter 18.10 IMC, Environmental Protection.

3    Impervious surface + pervious surface = one hundred (100) percent. Parking or pedestrian access areas that use “pervious pavers” or pervious stormwater measures shall not be counted towards the required pervious areas of the land use district.

4    The side and rear yard setbacks may be reduced to zero (0) feet when the property directly abutting the affected side and/or rear yard is under common ownership or when the side and/or rear lot lines abut rights-of-way and vehicular sight lines are met. An administrative adjustment of standards (AAS) may be sought by an applicant if the aforementioned conditions do not exist as allowed by IMC 18.07.330, Setbacks.

5    If the adjacent use is single family, then the side and/or rear yard setback is the same as the contiguous zoning.

6    The build-to line is the required placement of the building(s) on property frontage between the building and the right-of-way or private street edge if there is no right-of-way. Additional requirements for the area in between the property line and build-to line can be found in subsection (E)(13) of this section.

7    FAR reduction may be requested, if needed, for operational functions at the discretion of the Designated Official, using the administrative adjustment of standards process established in IMC 18.07.250, Administrative adjustment of standards. Approval criteria for FAR reduction is established in subsection (E)(19) of this section. For schools, operational functions include outdoor space that is used for required academic curriculum; for example: track and field areas. 

8    For public buildings, community space is not counted in the FAR calculation.

9    Public buildings may request an increase to the build-to line using the administrative adjustment of standards process established in IMC 18.07.250, Administrative adjustment of standards, based on approval criteria established in subsection (E)(20) of this section, Approval Criteria for Build-To Line Increase.

3.    Process for Public Schools and Public Buildings: Level 3 review;

4.    Access: Existing or proposed motorized and nonmotorized access to facilities, including barrier-free, pedestrian and bike, are provided and identified;

Appendix 1a

GRADE MEASUREMENT GRAPHIC
[IMAGE]


How to determine average grade:*

Step 1: Make an accurate scaled drawing of the building footprint on the site. The drawing needs to show the existing and proposed topography (using contour lines, at two (2) foot intervals).

Step 2: Show points on the drawing every ten (10) feet around the building footprint. For each point, provide spot elevations of the topography either as it exists today or as proposed, whichever is lower.

Step 3: Add up all of the spot elevations, and divide by the quantity of those spot elevations. This is the average grade.

Calculating the Average Grade

A+B+C+D thru M+N+O+P (add all spot elevations) = Average Grade

             16 (divide by # of spot elevations)

*Note: A similar method may be used as approved by the Planning Department.

(Ord. 2447 § 33, 2005).


Appendix 1b

BUILDING HEIGHT MEASUREMENT
[IMAGE]


How to show a proposed building complies with height limitations:*

Provide a drawing of each building elevation (north, south, east, and west). With a solid line, show the average grade on each and indicate in numerical terms (in example: 24.58') the elevation of that grade.

Provide another line corresponding to the highest point appropriate for the roof type. Indicate in numerical terms (e.g., 54.27') the elevation of that height.

*Note: A similar method may be used as approved by the Planning Department.

(Ord. 2447 § 34, 2005).


Appendix 2

DESIGN STANDARDS

Design Criteria Checklist

Instructions: This checklist is used to review a project proposal’s consistency with the City’s design criteria for Level 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Review. This checklist information, provided by the Planning Director/Manager (Level 0, 1 and 2) or the Development Commission (Level 3, 5 and 6) or the Hearing Examiner (Level 4) to the applicant is intended to be clear direction on the conditions necessary for design approval of the project’s finalized application. It is understood that a Level 0, 1, 2 and 3 Review shall receive more detailed and specific direction provided by the Planning Director/Manager (Level 0, 1 and 2) or Development Commission (Level 3) regarding design criteria than a Level 5 or 6 Review due to the larger size and scope of a Level 5 Review.

1.    If the design criteria has not been addressed to the satisfaction of the Planning Director/Manager (Level 0, 1 and 2) or Development Commission (Level 3 and 5) or Hearing Examiner (Level 4), clear written direction shall be identified as to how the project can meet the specific design criteria in the column titled “Conditions of Approval.” 

2.    If the design criteria has been addressed on the current site plan to the satisfaction of the Planning Director/Manager (Level 0, 1 and 2) or Development Commission (Level 3, 5 and 6) or Hearing Examiner (Level 4), the date of that site plan shall be listed in the column “Acceptable” so that there is clear direction to the applicant for the final application.

3.    “N/A” = “Not Applicable to this project.”

Additional Criteria: Adopted photographs and a color system (Ord. 1983) exemplify and illustrate the written design criteria within this checklist and shall be considered in interpreting and applying the written criteria. Copies of these photographs and color system shall be kept on file at the City Planning Department and are available for public inspection during regular business hours. The photographs and the color system are part of this checklist for interpreting and applying the written criteria.

	 	 	Conditions of Approval	Acceptable	N/A

	A. Site Layout and Overall Design Concepts	 	 	 

	1.	Building Location: Building locations and their orientation to one another provide for pedestrian/people areas such as courtyards, plazas, pocket parks, etc.	 	 	 

	2.	Energy Efficient Design: The project is oriented to receive maximum winter sun benefit and uses architectural features and/or landscaping to screen summer sun.	 	 	 

	3.	Functional Site Design: Design and layout of the buildings, parking areas, pedestrian areas, landscape and open areas are conducive to the existing topography and existing features of the site. Parking areas are designed so that they function well with the overall site design; for instance, parking areas provide safe and efficient nonmotorized movement, and traffic flow is predictable within the designated parking areas and driveways.	 	 	 

	4.	Lighting: 	 	 	 

	 	a. Lighting standards and fixtures are of a design and size compatible with the general character of the building and adjacent areas, including other lighting standards/fixtures. Design compatibility includes the following lighting standard/fixture characteristics: architectural style, standard/fixture color, light color, decoration, material, placement, texture and shape.

	 	b. Lighting complies with IMC 18.07.107, Outdoor lighting.	 	 	 

	5.	Natural Setting – Views: The relationship of the natural setting of the valley and surrounding mountains is used to enhance the overall design and layout of the plan in the following ways:	 	 	 

	 	a. Hillside Design: Structures built on hillsides are designed so that they blend into the hillside to minimize their visible impact to surrounding areas. The ridgeline of the hillside is not broken by any structures, lighting standards/fixtures, or loss of vegetative cover. Methods to integrate the structure into the hillside include: height control; colors that are muted instead of brilliant or bright colors; maintenance of existing trees to the greatest extent possible; and/or other appropriate methods.		 	 

	 	b. Primary Views: Public views of Mount Rainier, Cougar, Squak and Tiger Mountains are not blocked; for example, the view of Mount Rainier from Rainier Blvd. and the railroad ROW pathway should remain unobstructed.	 	 	 

	6.	Existing Vegetation/Topography Features: Existing vegetation, topography and other features of the site are preserved and integrated into the overall site design. Suitable existing vegetation shall be preserved, and measures to assure its preservation shall be provided.	 	 	 

	7.	Historical/Cultural Landmarks: Historical and cultural landmarks, and Issaquah Treasures (as adopted by Resolution 93-15) are preserved and integrated into the overall site design.	 	 	 

	B. Landscape Design and Use of Plant Materials	 	 	 

	1.	Design Elements: Architectural screens, fountains, and pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel and/or other similar methods and materials are used in conjunction or combination with plant materials (or in place of plant materials where planting opportunities are limited).	 	 	 

	2.	Design Unity: Unity of design is achieved through repetition of certain plant varieties and other materials and by correlation with adjacent developments.	 	 	 

	3.	Enhanced Design: 	 	 	 

	 	a. The landscape design of the site strengthens vistas and important focal points, provides for both solar exposure and shading where desirable, and retains significant existing vegetation.	 	 	 

	 	b. Trees and shrubs are planted in parkways or paved areas where building sites limit plantings.		 	 

	 	c. Parking areas and traffic ways are enhanced with landscaped areas that contain trees and tree groupings (see also “Nonmotorized and Vehicular Areas – Design – Parking Areas”).	 	 	 

	4.	Usable Open Space Design: The usable open space includes significant areas which have aesthetic value and/or value for recreational purposes and is easily accessible to the users of the development and to the general public (in cases where the open space has been dedicated), unless this guideline conflicts with the purpose and intent of the critical areas regulations.	 	 	 

	5.	Plant Materials – Selection:	 	 	 

	 	a. Appearance/Maintenance: Plant materials are selected for their structure, texture, and color as well as their ultimate growth and ease of maintenance. 	 	 	 

	 	b. Noxious or Destructive: Plant materials used for landscaping purposes are not destructive to sewer or water systems, sidewalks, building foundations or any other structure or utility. Noxious weeds and other plant materials including purple loosestrife and invasive species of ivy are not utilized in landscape planting plans. 	 	 	 

	 	c. Safety: Alder trees, cottonwood trees or other trees that typically grow very quickly, have weak trunks and branches and are prone to falling are not proposed for planting in parking areas, next to buildings or other structures or in any pedestrian-oriented area. Tree selection and placement should not diminish required outdoor lighting illumination of the intended pedestrian areas and parking lots. Tree selection and placement may be used to screen lighting from adjacent properties or downgrade viewing.		 	 

	C. Design Harmony and Compatibility	 	 	 

	1.	Accessory Structures: Street furniture, mailboxes, kiosks, lighting standards/fixtures, and accessory structures located on private property, public ways and other public properties are designed as part of the architectural concept of the building and landscape design.	 	 	 

	2.	Building Materials/Components: 	 	 	 

	 	a. Scale: Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, parapets, and signage have the same proportions, scale and relationship to one another. Building materials shall incorporate fire protection and emergency services access.	 	 	 

	 	b. Durability/Maintenance: Materials and finishes are selected for their durability and wear. Proper measures and devices are incorporated for protection against the elements, neglect, damage, and abuse. Configurations that tend to catch and accumulate debris, leaves, trash, and dirt should not be used.	 	 	 

	3.	Compatibility: The proposed development is designed and oriented to be compatible with existing permitted land uses adjacent to the site and with the surroundings, both manmade and natural. Elements influencing compatibility include but are not limited to color, signage and lighting, size, scale, mass, and architectural style and design.	 	 	 

	4.	Design Components:	 	 	 

	 	a. Colors: Bright and/or brilliant colors are used only minimally for accent. 	 	 	 

	 	b. Modulation: Modulation has been incorporated in the overall design to reduce the bulk and mass of the building(s).	 	 	 

	 	c. Facade: Articulate the different parts of a building’s facade by use of color, arrangement of facade elements, or a change in materials.	 	 	 

	 	d. Ground Level: Avoid blank walls at the ground level. Utilize windows, trellises, wall articulation, arcades, changes in materials, or other features.		 	 

	 	e. Large Structures: Large dominating structures should be broken up by creating horizontal emphasis through use of trim, adding windows or other ornamentation, use of colors, and landscape materials.	 	 	 

	 	f. Corporate Style: The use of standard “corporate” architectural style associated with chain-type business is strongly discouraged.	 	 	 

	5.	Signage:	 	 	 

	 	a. Architectural Element: Every sign is designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site to which it principally relates; lighting of signage is compatible with the architectural character of building; and is compatible with signs on adjoining premises.	 	 	 

	 	b. Graphic Elements: Graphic elements are held to the minimum needed to convey the sign’s major message and are composed in proportion to the area of the sign face.	 	 	 

	 	c. Materials: The colors, materials, and lighting are held to the minimum needed to convey the sign’s major message and are composed in proportion to the area of the sign face.	 	 	 

	 	d. Scale/Proportion: Every sign is of compatible scale and proportion in design and visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.	 	 	 

	6.	Transition: 	 	 	 

	 	a. The proposed development transitions well with adjoining, permitted land uses through architecture and landscaping in conformance with allowable setbacks.	 	 	 

	 	b. Conflicting Architectural Styles: In applicable cases, structures are made compatible with adjacent buildings of conflicting architectural styles by such means as screens and site breaks, or other suitable methods and materials.		 	 

	7.	Projects with Multiple Structures: Variable siting of individual buildings, heights of buildings, building modulation or other methods are used in order to prevent monotonous design.	 	 	 

	D. Nonmotorized and Vehicular Areas	 	 	 

	1.	Barrier-Free: The location of the handicap access ramp is in close proximity to designated parking space(s).	 	 	 

	2.	Circulation/Trail Access: Linkages for safe circulation for pedestrians and bicycles are provided within the site, and connect adjoining existing or proposed sidewalks and bicycle paths. Developments, including single family subdivisions, maintain trail access to existing and established trails through dedication of public easements.	 	 	 

	3.	Design – Parking Areas: Vehicle parking areas are designed into the project in a manner that screens the majority of the parking area from both the public and the building occupants. Methods for limiting the visibility of the parking area to the surrounding area include: orienting parking areas away from building and pedestrian areas; placing the building adjacent to the main roadway, with parking behind the building; screening parking areas with intensive landscape barriers which provide solid screening during all seasons; using wooden fencing, berms or other solid method of screening; and/or other creative means.	 	 	 

	4.	Public Access – Adjacent to Site: In areas where lakes, parks and scenic or shared use corridors and other recreational areas are adjacent to the project boundaries, public access is encouraged and enhanced in an environmentally sensitive manner beyond the predevelopment status.		 	 

	5.	Public Access – Within Site: In nonresidential projects, provisions are made for public access to any lakes and to scenic corridor areas within a site. The access is environmentally sensitive in design.	 	 	 

	6.	Trail and Nonmotorized Facility Design: Pedestrian and bicycle paths are designed to limit conflicts between motorized and nonmotorized modes, by providing a separated walkway system, bicycle facilities, permanent markings, and other methods. Trails or other nonmotorized facilities should use features such as setbacks, landscaping, fencing, grade separation, and sight lines to maximize the privacy provided to any adjacent single family homes.	 	 	 

	7.	Transition of Design Elements and Amenities: The site plan provides a desirable transition in relation to the streetscape, including adequate planting, safe nonmotorized movement, and parking areas.	 	 	 

	E. Service and Storage Areas	 	 	 

	1.	Screening – Service Yards and Outdoor Storage: Service yards, machinery storage, other storage areas, dumpster/recycling areas and other places which tend to be unsightly are screened through the use of walls and/or fencing of solid material, softened or accented by plantings. The height of the walls/fencing shall be six (6) feet in height, or at least the height of the items to be screened. Screening will be effective in both winter and summer. For example, in the IC zone, although both would be softened by plantings, a six (6) foot solid fence/wall may be preferable to a twelve (12) foot solid wall/fence which completely screens heavy machinery since the adjacent uses could be “intensive commercial” as well.	 	 	 

	2.	Screening – Mechanical Equipment: Mechanical equipment is completely screened. Screening will be effective in both winter and summer. Examples of mechanical equipment include electrical transformer pads and vaults, communication equipment, and other utility hardware on roofs, grounds or buildings.	 	 	 

	3.	Screening – Display Areas: Outdoor display areas for vehicles, other equipment for sale or rent, or live plant material are landscaped in a manner that breaks up the mass of pavement or displayed items but need not be landscaped to have the same screening effect required for a service or storage area.	 	 	 



Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED “sep-ted”)

CPTED principles, performance standards and strategies are used during project development review to identify and incorporate design features which reduce opportunities for criminal activity to occur. CPTED design principles are functional grouped into four categories:

1.    Access Control: This category focuses on the techniques that prevent and/or deter unauthorized and/or inappropriate access.

2.    Natural Surveillance: This category focuses on strategies to design the built environment in a manner that promotes visibility of public spaces and areas.

3.    Territorial Reinforcement/Ownership: This category focuses on strategies to reduce the perception of areas as “ownerless” and therefore available for undesirable uses.

4.    Target Hardening: This category focuses on strategies to reduce the ability to enter the building. Strategies include deadbolts on outside doors, door locks at least 40 inches from adjacent windows; however, no landscaping strategies are included.

Instructions: This checklist is used to review a project proposal’s consistency with the City’s landscape requirements as they relate to CPTED. The applicant is required to meet these requirements. This checklist information, provided by the Planning Director/Manager to the applicant, is intended to be clear direction on the conditions necessary for approval of the project’s application in regard to CPTED requirements.

1    Note: This is only a summary. Please see the state’s adopted siting criteria for more detail. This summary is taken from the DOE “Zoning Guidelines for Hazardous Waste Treatment and Storage Facilities” publication, revised April 1991. 

2    “Nonland based facility” means a facility which does not use the land as an integral part of its waste management method and is not subject to the requirements of WAC 173-303-806(4)(a)(xiii). These facilities include, but are not limited to, tanks, containers, and incinerators. 

3    “Land based facility” means a dangerous waste management facility which falls under the definition of “land disposal” as defined in Section 3004(k) of the Resource Conservatory and Recovery Act. These facilities use the land as an integral part of their waste management method and include, but are not limited to, landfills, surface impoundments, waste piles, and land treatment facilities. For the purposes of this section, this would not include waste piles in which the dangerous wastes are stored inside or under a structure that provides protection from precipitation and when runoff, leachate, or other types of waste dispersal are not generated under any conditions. 

*    Mitigative measures are required to site in this area.

Chapter 18.08 NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS

Sections:

18.08.010    Purpose and intent.

18.08.020    Illegal uses, structures and lots not permitted.

18.08.030    Establishment.

18.08.040    Nonconforming existing lots of record.

18.08.050    Nonconforming situations (including structures and uses).

18.08.060    Approval criteria.

18.08.070    Sale of a nonconforming situation.

18.08.080    Extension, expansion or joint use of nonconforming utility facilities.

18.08.085    Expansion or reconstruction of nonconforming situations within the Community Facilities Recreation and Community Facilities – Facilities zones.

18.08.090    Nonconforming situations matrix.


18.08.010 Purpose and intent.

A.    Purpose: This chapter regulates legal nonconforming lots, structures, uses, and other development situations, excluding signs, parking and landscaping, which were made nonconforming through the adoption of, or amendments to, this Code. This chapter also specifies those circumstances, conditions, and procedures under which such nonconformities may be permitted to continue, expand, or be modified. Signs, parking and landscaping nonconforming situations are addressed in Chapters 18.11, 18.09 and 18.12 IMC (respectively).

B.    Intent: The intent of this chapter is to permit existing, legal, nonconforming lots, structures, uses, or other development situations to continue to exist without specific time limitations, but to also encourage conformity over time. It is also intended to balance an applicant’s request for relief from a hardship of a nonconforming situation with the public benefit resulting from denial of the relief requested. (Ord. 2108 § 8.1, 1996).


18.08.020 Illegal uses, structures and lots not permitted.

Structures, lots, site improvements, and/or uses which were not legally conforming or existing as of the effective date of this Code retain their illegal status and must be abated or fully conform and comply with the procedural and substantive provisions of this Code. Any proposal for site improvements and/or modification for illegal nonconforming situations must comply with the standards and provisions of this Code. Regular maintenance, such as re-roofing or painting, does not require provisions for conformance. (Ord. 2108 § 8.2, 1996).


18.08.030 Establishment.

The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a legal nonconformity as defined herein shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such nonconformity and shall not rest upon the City. Upon request, the Permit Center shall assist the property owner in locating public records which pertain to the legal status of the nonconformity. If the owner cannot establish that the structure, lot, site improvement or use is a legal nonconformity, the City may require Code conformance of the situation as required by the Code. (Ord. 2108 § 8.3, 1996).


18.08.040 Nonconforming existing lots of record.

A.    Legal Nonconforming Lots – All Districts: Development may be permitted on a legal, nonconforming lot in any district; provided all pertinent local and state rules and regulations are met, including setbacks, impervious surface ratio, required critical area buffers, landscape requirements, and parking. This section shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the district requirements for lot size and/or width. 

B.    Legal Nonconforming Residential Lots: There is a lot size exception for one (1) or two (2) lots of single ownership, as follows: In any residential zone, a single family dwelling may be established on a lot which cannot meet the lot size requirements of the zone, or one (1) single family dwelling on each of two (2) such lots when they have a common side lot line; provided that:

1.    All other setback and coverage requirements shall apply; and

2.    The owner of such lot(s) does not own any property adjoining either lot(s) except the subject lots; and

18.08.050 Nonconforming situations (including structures and uses).

A.    Continuation of a Legal Nonconforming Situation: Any legal nonconforming situation with respect to this Code may continue, including routine maintenance and repair, unless otherwise regulated by this Code. An existing legal nonconforming situation may be included in and/or changed as part of any development, subject to review and approval under this Code.

B.    Reconstruction of an Involuntarily Damaged or Destroyed Legal Nonconforming Situation: If a legal nonconforming situation is partially or fully damaged or destroyed due to accident, act of nature, or similar involuntary occurrence, the situation may be repaired or reconstructed as follows:

1.    Single Family Residential Uses: A nonconforming single family dwelling or duplex may be reconstructed, regardless of value, subject to a Level 0 Review; provided, that the degree of nonconformity shall not be increased.

2.    All Other Uses with Less Than Seventy-Five (75) Percent Construction Value: When reconstruction costs are less than seventy-five (75) percent of the latest King County assessed improvement value a Level 0 Review is required; provided, that the degree of nonconformity shall not be increased. Any nonconforming use shall be replaced with the specific use damaged or destroyed or a permitted use.

3.    All Other Uses with Seventy-Five (75) Percent or More Construction Value: When reconstruction costs are greater than or equal to seventy-five (75) percent of the latest King County assessed improvement value, the level of review is determined by the Table of Permitted Land Uses and the structure and/or site elements subject to reconstruction shall conform to this title to the fullest extent practical and feasible. Any nonconforming use shall be replaced with the specific use damaged or destroyed or a permitted use.

4.    Time Limit: The required permit applications for repair or reconstruction shall be submitted and deemed complete within one (1) year of the occurrence of damage or destruction or the project must be brought into compliance with all applicable codes.

C.    Change of a Legal Nonconforming Situation (Including Remodel or Alteration of a Structure or Site): A nonconforming situation may be changed, including the remodel or alteration of a structure or site; provided, that the change shall decrease the degree of nonconformity by conforming to the fullest extent practical and feasible with the applicable provisions of this title for the structure and/or site elements subject to change. The required review level is determined as follows:

1.    Less Than Seventy-Five (75) Percent Construction Value: If the remodel or alteration costs are less than seventy-five (75) percent of the latest King County assessed improvement value, the change shall be reviewed through a Level 0 Review.

2.    Greater Than or Equal to Seventy-Five (75) Percent Construction Value: If remodel or alteration costs are greater than or equal to seventy-five (75) percent of the latest King County assessed improvement value, the change shall be reviewed through a level consistent with the Table of Permitted Land Uses.

3.    Parking: Changes to a legally nonconforming parking situation shall be addressed by the provisions of Chapter 18.09 IMC, Parking.

4.    Signs: Changes to a legally nonconforming sign situation shall be addressed by the provisions of Chapter 18.11 IMC, Signs.

5.    Landscaping: Changes to a legally nonconforming landscaping situation shall be addressed by the provisions of Chapter 18.12 IMC, Landscaping.

E.    Change of a Legal Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming use shall only be changed to a use permitted in the applicable zoning district. The review process is determined by the appropriate level of review listed in the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130).

F.    Discontinued Legal Nonconforming Use: If a legal nonconforming use has been discontinued for more than twelve (12) months, the new use shall be a permitted use. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of twelve (12) months or greater is deemed to be an intention to abandon said use. The Planning Director/Manager may extend the time frame for reestablishment or reconstruction of a nonconforming use of a structure or land beyond the twelve (12) month time limit; provided, that the owner or authorized agent can document that the reestablishment or reconstruction has not commenced due to pending insurance or court settlement directly related to the damage or destruction. The extension shall not exceed one (1) year, and building permits shall be applied for prior to the expiration of the extension.

G.    Expansion of a Nonconforming Situation: A change to a nonconforming situation which increases the degree of nonconformity is not permitted except as allowed in IMC 18.08.085, Expansion or reconstruction of nonconforming situations within the Community Facilities Recreation and Community Facilities – Facilities zones.

H.    Undefined Nonconforming Situations: Nonconforming situations not addressed in this section and not addressed by other sections such as the sign, landscaping, and parking sections shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director/Manager. The Planning Director/Manager shall determine the extent of change permitted to the nonconformity (i.e., bring into conformance, decrease, maintain, or increase nonconformity) and the appropriate level of review.

I.    Critical Areas: Changes to an existing legal nonconforming situation with respect to critical area wetland and stream buffers are subject to the following requirements:

1.    New Development and Redevelopment: 

a.    New development and redevelopment shall comply with wetland buffer standards in IMC 18.10.640 and stream buffer standards in IMC 18.10.785.

18.09.010 General provisions – Parking standards.

A.    Purpose of Parking Standards: The purpose of parking standards is to assure adequate off-street parking, reduce on-street parking, increase traffic safety, maintain smooth traffic flow, and reduce the visual impact of parking lots. These standards are also designed to achieve safe and efficient vehicular and nonmotorized circulation and economy of space.

B.    Intent of Parking Standards: The intent of the parking standards is to promote effective use of transportation facilities with the goal of moving people from place to place. Emphasis shall be given to alternate methods of moving people which will: deter traffic congestion; promote environmental quality through less use of fossil fuels and potentially less impervious surface needed for parking areas; and provide convenience and reliability to commuters, residents, pedestrians, employees, tourists, shoppers, students, bicyclists, special populations and service providers. Commuter mobility is enhanced by: providing ride sharing through preferred parking arrangements; providing incentives to include parking and storage of bicycles in development and redevelopment plans; and requiring safe, direct nonmotorized access from public rights-of-way to structures/developments.

C.    Applicability and Authority:

1.    Existing Uses: Unless an expansion or change of use is requested, these provisions shall not be applicable to uses which conform to parking requirements existing prior to the effective date of such provisions (Land Use Code update Ord. 2107). A change of tenant that retains the same or similar use shall not be required to “upgrade” to meet the parking standards of this Code. If there is a conflict regarding a specific interpretation of a “similar” use of the new tenant, the Planning Director/Manager shall make an interpretation, through the Level 0 Review (Chapter 18.04 IMC).

2.    New Developments or a Change of Use: These provisions are applicable to new developments and to changes of use for existing developments.

3.    Substantial Remodels or Additions: These provisions are applicable to substantial remodels or additions which expand the gross floor area of the use by ten (10) percent or greater. Remodels or additions to single family units do not require additional parking spaces; however, the site plan must be consistent with the other parking standards.

4.    Authority – Unclassified Uses: If this section does not specify a parking requirement for a specific land use, the Planning Director/Manager shall establish the minimum requirement based on the nearest comparable parking demand through the Level 0 Review. The applicant may be required to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the parking demand for a specific land use will be satisfied, based upon existing land uses similar to the proposed use. The applicant shall provide a parking study for the proposed use which shall be prepared by a professional with expertise in traffic and parking analyses. (Ord. 2447 § 55, 2005; Ord. 2108 § 9.1, 1996).


18.09.020 Nonconforming parking.

A.    Demolition and Change of Use: Developments which had legal nonconforming parking facilities prior to the effective date of these provisions (Land Use Code update Ord. 2107) must become conforming when:

1.    A structure is demolished; or

2.    The use of the development is changed to a dissimilar use.

B.    Additions: If the basis for calculating required parking is increased, such as adding gross floor area, seats, units, or other measure, then required parking shall be provided for the increased amount.

C.    CBD: See IMC 18.09.130, Olde Town parking provisions, for requirements in the CBD zoning district. (Ord. 2549 § 4, 2009; Ord. 2108 § 9.2, 1996).


18.09.030 Provision of required parking.

A.    Purpose of Required Parking Spaces: The purpose of requiring parking as a condition of development is to provide an adequate amount of vehicle parking for a specific use, recognizing that a balance must be reached between:

1.    Inadequate Parking: Leading to traffic congestion and additional parking violations on adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots; and

2.    Excessive Parking: Wasting space and resources that could be better utilized for development or pervious surface. 

B.    Conformance: All off-street parking shall comply with the provisions of this Code.

C.    Permit Required: Off-street parking or loading spaces shall not be created, constructed, located, relocated or modified after the effective date of these provisions without first obtaining a Building Permit or Clearing and Grading Permit. 

D.    Accessory Uses – Same Review: All off-street and loading spaces which are not themselves primary uses are considered accessory uses and shall be subject to the same procedures and review requirements as primary uses.

E.    Use of Required Parking: Required off-street parking is intended to provide vehicle parking only for residents, customers, patrons and employees. Area devoted to parking may not be used for any other purpose, except as authorized by this Code. Required off-street parking shall not be used for:

1.    The storage of vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats, or other materials; 

2.    The parking of vehicles used in conducting the business; or

3.    The sale, repair or servicing of any vehicle. 

F.    Location of Parking:

1.    Single Family/Duplex: Required parking for single family units and duplexes shall be on-site.

2.    Multifamily: Parking is not permitted in the side setback of a multifamily development when the parking would abut a single family district. In other cases, parking for multifamily development is allowed in the rear and side setback.

3.    Other Uses: The minimum required off-street parking area shall be provided within eight hundred (800) feet of the building or use for which the parking area is required.

4.    All Uses: Parking and the storage and/or display of vehicles shall not be provided in any required landscape planting area unless otherwise allowed by Chapter 18.12 IMC, Landscaping.

G.    Unlawful Elimination of Required Parking or Loading Spaces: An owner or operator of any building or land use affected by this section shall not eliminate or reduce required parking or loading facilities without the establishment of alternative parking or loading facilities which meet the requirements of this section.

H.    Change in Current Use: When a change of use is proposed for an existing structure, required parking shall be provided according to the parking standards within this section. If the proposed use requires more parking than the previous use, the applicant shall provide that additional parking as an approval condition of development.

I.    Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided as follows:

1.    Quantity: All sites required to provide nonmotorized facilities shall provide bicycle parking spaces equal to five (5) percent of required automobile parking parking spaces for the first three hundred (300) required auto stalls and one (1) percent of auto stalls in excess of three hundred (300). Only customer and employee parking spaces shall be used to determine this requirement. In no case shall the amount be less than two (2) bicycle spaces.

2.    Location: Bicycle parking shall be placed in a publicly visible location within fifty (50) feet of a primary building entrance. Bicycle parking shall not block pedestrian use of a walkway. Shopping centers or other multibuilding developments may group bicycle parking in a unified location, provided the location is consistent with the other location requirements.

3.    Exceptions:

a.    Sites requiring eight (8) or fewer auto stalls are exempt from bicycle parking.

b.    The Planning Director/Manager may reduce the quantity of bicycle parking spaces when it is demonstrated that bicycle activity will be limited at that location, but in no case can the amount be reduced to less than two (2) bicycle spaces.

c.    The Planning Director/Manager may require additional spaces when it is determined that the use or its location will generate a high volume of bicycle activity. Such a determination will include but not be limited to the following uses:

(1)    Park/playfield;

(2)    Marina;

(3)    Library/museum/arboretum;

(4)    Elementary/secondary school or colleges/universities;

(5)    Sports club; or

(6)    Retail business (when located along a developed bicycle trail or designated bicycle route). (Ord. 2587 § 3 (Exh. B2), 2010; Ord. 2447 § 56, 2005; Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 9.3, 1996).


18.09.040 Off-street parking standards.

A.    Intent: The intent of the off-street parking standards is to provide adequate parking for individual uses within the City. These standards are based on the assumption that intensity of use governs the need for parking. For example, restaurants are typically more intense than office uses and require a higher ratio of parking. Specific off-street parking standards are listed in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.050). Generally:

1.    One (1) space per one hundred (100) square feet for high traffic uses (restaurants, taverns);

2.    One (1) space per two hundred (200) square feet for retail commercial;

3.    One (1) space per three hundred (300) square feet for offices;

4.    One (1) space per five hundred (500) square feet for land intensive commercial uses (car, lumber sales, or rental equipment).

B.    Computation of Required Spaces:

1.    Gross Floor Area: For the purpose of calculating the minimum number of required parking spaces, gross floor area means the total of all floor areas of a building as measured from the interior surface of each exterior wall of the structure excluding stairwells and elevator shafts, mechanical rooms, janitorial sink rooms, restrooms, attic space and interior vehicular parking or loading, and all floors below the first or ground floor, except when used or intended to be used for human habitation or service to the public. Hallways, lobbies, conference rooms, ground level or above ground storage rooms, enclosed porches and balconies shall be included in the gross floor area.

2.    Fraction: If the calculation of the number of off-street parking spaces in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards contains a fraction, such number shall be rounded up or down to the next whole number: fractions less than one-half (0.5) shall be rounded down to the whole number and fractions which are one-half (0.5) and greater shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.

3.    Use Not Listed in Table: If a proposed use is not addressed in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards, the parking requirements shall be determined through a Level 0 Review (IMC 18.04.110 through 18.04.270).

4.    Parking Reduction for CBD: See IMC 18.09.130, Olde Town parking provisions. All other parts of this section still apply in the CBD.

5.    Parking Reduction for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: See IMC 18.09.140, Electric vehicle charging parking provisions.

6.    Administrative Adjustment of Standards: An applicant may request an Administrative Adjustment to the parking standards for an individual project, as established (IMC 18.09.060). (Ord. 2624 § 5 (Exh. A4a), 2011; Ord. 2549 § 4, 2009; Ord. 2108 § 9.4, 1996).

18.09.060 Administrative Adjustment of Parking Standards.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of permitting the Administrative Adjustment of Parking Standards or requirements is to provide for flexibility in reducing or modifying parking standards in all zoning districts, without permitting an adjustment that would negatively impact the surrounding neighborhood. An adjustment to a parking standard or requirement may be approved based on a determination by the Planning Director/Manager that the adjustment is consistent with the purpose of this Code, and the intent and purposes of the parking standards and/or requirements.

B.    Process: The Planning Director/Manager has the authority to make the final decision regarding Administrative Adjustment of Standards for all levels of review. The Planning Director/Manager shall consider the application information regarding the approval criteria which has been provided by the applicant and any public comment which has been received within the comment period. The Planning Director/Manager may request input from the Chair of the Development Commission during the comment period; however, this is not required. The Planning Director/Manager’s decision on the Administrative Adjustment of Standards is final unless appealed. The Planning Director/Manager’s decision on Administrative Adjustment of Standards is appealable as established for Level 2 Review (Chapter 18.04 IMC).

C.    Applicability and Approval Criteria: An Administrative Adjustment to Parking Standards or requirements may include the amount of compact parking spaces; the materials used for parking areas; the required spaces for a specific project; or any other parking standard governed by this chapter. The following is a listing of potential Administrative Adjustments of Parking Standards and the individual approval criteria.

D.    Required Parking Spaces: The purpose of an Administrative Adjustment for required parking spaces is to provide flexibility to those uses which may be extraordinary, unique or to provide flexibility to a combination of uses which makes the parking spaces appear inappropriate. Approval criteria for the Administrative Adjustment, in addition to the criteria for the Level 2 Review, are as follows:

1.    Documentation: The applicant shall document that the individual project will require the amount of parking which is different from that required under the required parking standards. Documentation may include the parking requirements and performance of similar uses in other areas, or other related information;

2.    Function and Use of Site: The applicant shall demonstrate that modifying the amount of required parking spaces will not negatively impact the use or function of the site and/or adjacent sites;

3.    Intent: The applicant shall demonstrate that the adjustment of the standards will be equal to, or superior in, fulfilling the intent and purpose of the original requirements;

4.    Numbers of Employees/Customers: The applicant shall establish:

a.    An on-site transportation management program for uses with fifteen (15) or more employees;

b.    Valet parking or shuttle service, where appropriate; and

c.    The applicant shall demonstrate that the number of employees/customers is lower or higher than the established “industry standard” based on comparative information of similar uses in other areas; and

5.    Tree Retention: The applicant shall demonstrate that the adjustment allows for the retention of existing significant trees. Significant trees retained through this provision shall be considered protected trees and not able to be removed without replacement.

E.    Shared Parking: The purpose of shared parking is to efficiently utilize parking resources where the potential for shared parking provisions with adjacent land uses has been analyzed and found to be appropriate with the following criteria, including special provisions for shared employee parking:

1.    Prime Hours of Operation: Majority of employees arrive and leave site at nonpeak hours for parking lot usage, and can stagger the use of the parking lot; or

2.    Shuttle: Majority of customers arrive at one time and valet parking or shuttle service is used.

F.    Other Parking Standards: The following approval criteria, in addition to the Level 2 Review criteria, are required in order to permit an Administrative Adjustment of other parking standards:

1.    Access: The proposal will not create negative impacts to the adjacent properties or rights-of-way, dedicated tracts, or easements; 

2.    Compatibility: The proposal is compatible with the character, scale and existing uses of the surrounding neighborhood;

3.    Intent: The adjustment of the standards will be equal to, or superior in, fulfilling the intent and purpose of the original requirements; 

4.    Safety: The proposal does not negatively impact any safety features of the project, nor create any hazardous features; and

5.    Services: The proposal will not create negative impacts to public services, including fire and emergency services. (Ord. 2546 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2543 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2108 § 9.6, 1996).


18.09.070 Approval criteria for special uses.

A.    Automotive Sales, Rental and Leasing: The minimum number of customer/employee parking stalls for car dealerships shall be based on the gross building square footage, including the indoor display area, but not including any outdoor display areas.

B.    Mixed Uses: When different uses occupy a single structure or parcel that is not considered a shopping center by this Code, the total required parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements of the individual uses. 

C.    Shared Parking:

1.    Purpose: The purpose of shared parking is to efficiently use parking facilities for more than one (1) use, specifically uses whose prime hours of operation do not overlap. The intent of this provision is to decrease the amount of parking provided for a specific use by sharing adjacent underutilized parking facilities. 

2.    Review for Shared Parking: 

a.    Existing Buildings: Shared parking may be approved administratively by the Planning Director/Manager for existing buildings through a Level 1 Review;

b.    New Projects/Buildings: Shared parking for new projects or buildings does not require a separate review process, and may be approved within the site plan review process under which the project is being reviewed.

3.    Spaces Required: Number of spaces required for shared parking:

a.    Nonoverlapping Prime Hours of Operation: If the businesses have nonoverlapping prime hours of operation, the property owner(s) shall provide parking spaces equal to those required of the business with the greater of the applicable individual parking requirements. 

b.    Overlapping Prime Hours of Operation: If the businesses have overlapping prime hours of operation, the property owner(s) shall provide parking spaces equal to the total of the individual parking requirements.

c.    The required number of spaces for shared parking may be reduced by ten (10) percent in the CBD zoning district consistent with Chapter 18.19 IMC, Olde Town Design Standards. 

4.    Approval Criteria for Shared Parking: Shared parking for businesses with either nonoverlapping or overlapping prime hours of operation may be approved if all of the following approval criteria are met:

a.    Location: The location of the parking facilities must be:

(1)    Generally within a radius of eight hundred (800) feet from the lot lines of the uses which are involved in the shared parking contract, allowing for flexibility if the site for shared parking is within a reasonable distance to the uses. If shared parking is used only for employees of the involved uses, the location can be outside the eight hundred (800) foot radius; and 

(2)    Zoned to permit parking facilities outright, or through a specific site plan review process.

b.    Nonmotorized Facilities: Provision of nonmotorized facilities consistent with Chapter 18.07 IMC that connect the respective uses and the shared parking facilities.

c.    Signage: The availability of parking for each use is indicated by directional signs governed by this Code (Chapter 18.11 IMC).

d.    Shared Parking Contract: A contract is enacted, signed by all the owners/operators of the shared uses and the City, which provides for City enforcement. The shared parking contract shall:

(1)    Provide that the land comprising the required shared parking facilities shall not be encroached upon, used, sold, leased, or conveyed for any purpose, except in conjunction with the building or use which the required parking serves, so long as the shared parking facilities are needed. The contract terms shall be for at least a five (5) year minimum; 

(2)    Indicate prime hours of operation for shared uses;

(3)    Assign maintenance provisions for the parking facilities and landscaping;

(4)    Designate potential times of overflow, and a parking plan which will be implemented in the event of overflow; and

(5)    The parking contract approved by the Planning Director/Manager shall be filed with the deed of the parcels involved, so that the agreement is binding upon successors.

e.    Contract Changes: Changes to the contract, or a redrafting of the original enacted contract, must be reviewed and approved through the Level 1 Review process before the shared parking contract is within compliance of this Code. Termination of this contract may occur through an approval through Level 1 Review. 

f.    Evaluation Upon Request: The City may reevaluate the parking situation upon request, at the expense of the owner, and at this time the City may:

(1)    Permit the shared parking to continue as in the past; or 

(2)    Continue the situation with additional conditions related to new information, for example, information regarding prime hours of operation or other information; or 

(3)    Request that other parking provisions be implemented before the use(s) may continue due to problems with the existing situation.

5.    Implementation Problems: If shared parking is not functioning according to the contract, the property owners or the City may request to alter the shared parking contract. If consensus cannot be reached, traditional parking will be required as established in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards. The property owner may also propose an Administrative Adjustment of Standards as an option for implementation problems.

D.    Shopping Centers:

1.    Purpose of Required Standard for Shopping Centers: The purpose of parking standards for shopping centers is to balance the parking needs of small and large businesses and the variety of uses within a shopping center. More efficient provision of parking is accomplished through a general standard for shopping centers, and this system accommodates the changing of businesses and uses within a shopping center. 

2.    Computation of Required Spaces: Within a shopping center, all uses, excluding theaters, shall calculate the parking requirement using the shopping center standard as established in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards. Theaters shall provide parking pursuant to the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards. The theater gross floor area (GFA) is not used to calculate remaining shopping center parking requirements, but only used to define specific parking for that use and shall not be used in the shopping center calculation.

3.    Change or Expansion of Use: When a change or expansion of use occurs within an established shopping center, additional parking shall be provided if additional square footage for the use is being requested, unless the applicant can provide information showing that the shopping center has adequate parking, based on the standards in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards. When a change of use involves a theater within the shopping center, the applicant shall provide parking pursuant to the Table of Off-Street Parking.

E.    Tandem Parking:

1.    Purpose: The purpose of tandem parking is to allow flexibility in the parking provisions for single family and duplex uses, and for other uses under certain conditions. Tandem parking may be permitted in multifamily, office or commercial projects through an Administrative Adjustment of Standards (AAS). 

2.    Review Required: Proposals for tandem parking shall be processed through the Level 1 Review.

3.    Approval Criteria: Tandem parking may be permitted if all of the following approval criteria are met:

a.    Each duplex may have only one (1) tandem parking stall (equaling two (2) parking spaces) for each dwelling unit within the duplex;

b.    Ingress and egress for the tandem parking stalls do not interfere with the safety of residents or adjacent property owners;

c.    Tandem parking stalls must be of standard size; compact tandem stalls are not permitted;

d.    For multifamily, office or commercial projects, tandem parking must address the need for individual occupants to coordinate parking based on a written parking plan. The proposal must also meet the AAS approval criteria for IMC 18.09.060(F), Other Parking Standards.

F.    Nonmotorized Facilities: Nonmotorized facilities shall be provided consistent with Chapter 18.07 IMC. (Ord. 2549 § 4, 2009; Ord. 2447 § 57, 2005; Ord. 2311 § 7, 2001; Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 9.7, 1996).


18.09.080 Time of completion.

A.    Prior Installation of Required Parking: All parking improvements including striping and graphics required by this Code shall be installed prior to any change in the use of land or structures and prior to the occupancy of any new or enlarged structure.

B.    Delay of Installation:

1.    Delayed Parking: Upon approval of the Planning Director/Manager, completion of the required parking improvements may be delayed due to inclement weather or poor soil conditions (example: settling of fill). Requests for such delays shall be submitted in writing and shall explain the reason for the request and an estimated completion date for the improvements. No delay shall be longer than six (6) months, and all approved delays shall be bonded pursuant to the City’s estimate of the value of the delayed improvements.

2.    Reserved Parking:

a.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of reserved parking is to:

(1)    Provide less “paved and striped” parking than the minimum required, given documentation by the applicant which indicates a lower parking demand for the specific site or use; and

(2)    Provide landscaping in lieu of remaining parking which could be converted into “paved and striped” parking if site/use conditions change. The intent of reserved parking is to permit less impervious surface until conversion to parking is deemed necessary by the Planning Director/Manager.

b.    Delay of Completion: The Planning Director/Manager may grant a delay in completion of up to fifty (50) percent of the required parking for a particular use for either an unlimited or a specific time period contingent upon all of the following criteria being met:

(1)    Presentation of satisfactory evidence from the applicant that the anticipated parking needs of the proposed facility are significantly less than those provided for in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards;

(2)    Submission of a Site Plan Showing:

(A)    The parking area to be immediately developed;

(B)    The reserved area fully designed as a landscaped area initially and as a parking area in the future; and

(C)    The reserved area included as impervious surface for the site calculations and storm drainage calculations;

(3)    The area designated for reserved parking is not a right-of-way or a dedicated easement;

(4)    There are no structures/buildings intended for or constructed in the subject area;

(5)    A monitoring program is created which shall include a site visit every six (6) months, by an official designated by the Planning Director/Manager, to ensure there are no parking problems. The program shall also include alternative transportation management procedures the applicant shall follow if minor or occasional parking problems occur; and

(6)    A letter from the applicant (sample available from Permit Center) guaranteeing full and satisfactory completion of all required parking improvements upon written notice of requirement by the Planning Director/Manager. (Ord. 2108 § 9.8, 1996).


18.09.090 Parking area standards.

Parking lot dimensions are found in IMC 18.09.095, Parking layout dimensions. Additional construction standards are found in Issaquah’s Street Standards.

A.    Purpose of Parking Area Standards:

1.    Purpose of Parking Area: The purpose of a parking area is to provide safe, barrier-free access connecting the parking area to the specific use for persons using the parking area.

2.    Purpose of Required Standard Spaces and Aisles: The purpose of requiring standard parking spaces is to provide safe access and adequate parking area for vehicles, including public safety vehicles. Standard aisle widths and radius shall permit accessibility to vehicles, including public safety vehicles.

B.    Materials: Single family residential uses are not required to pave and stripe their parking and circulation areas. All other parking and circulation areas must be hard surfaced, consistent with the City of Issaquah’s current construction standards. Gravel, turf-block or other similar alternative surface may be permitted only if all of the following approval criteria are met:

1.    Barrier-Free: Those portions of the parking and nonmotorized area are surfaced according to barrier-free regulations;

2.    Access to Right-of-Way: At least twenty (20) feet of the initial vehicular entrance leading to all the rights-of-way are paved in order to minimize any dust, gravel or other material from being transported from the parking area to adjacent streets or alleys;

3.    Character/Location: The alternative surface may be appropriate because of the character of the use and/or the character of the location; and

4.    Maintenance: The alternative surface shall be maintained, as needed, by the property owner; and

5.    Parking Standards: The alternative surface meets all other parking standards, excluding striping, but including landscaping and screening.

C.    Marking: The property owner shall identify required parking stalls, directional arrows and crosswalks within parking areas using paint or other methods approved by the Planning Director/Manager and required by Street Construction Standards. Crosswalk marking shall be provided consistent with IMC 18.07.080(B). Paint is not permitted as a sole means of marking crosswalks. Display areas which are not required parking areas, such as a car dealership or rental display area, are not required to be marked as individual stalls.

D.    Parallel Parking Stalls: Parallel parking stalls shall be designed so that the doors of the vehicles do not open into the public right-of-way (for parking lot construction details, see IMC 18.09.095, Parking layout dimensions).

E.    Lighting: All lighting shall be designed and installed to avoid glare or reflection of light. Light standards shall not be located where they may interfere with parking stalls, stacking areas, and ingress and egress to parking areas. Also see IMC 18.07.107, Outdoor lighting.

F.    Driveways:

1.    Location and Design: The location and design of driveways shall be reviewed by the City in accordance with the City’s driveway construction standards found in Issaquah’s Street Construction Standards.

2.    Combined Driveways: The owners of adjoining properties shall provide combined driveways wherever practical. In conjunction with approval of a development, the City may require a property owner to provide an access and circulation easement to an abutting owner where joint access is reasonable to serve future development.

G.    Design Standards and Stall Dimensions:

1.    Stall dimensions including standard, compact and parallel stall dimensions shall be designed as shown in IMC 18.09.095, Parking layout dimensions. The dimensions for ninety (90) degree, head-in parking stalls shall be:

a.    Standard – nine (9) feet by twenty (20) feet;

b.    Compact – nine (9) feet by fifteen (15) feet;

c.    Parallel stalls – eight (8) feet by twenty-three (23) feet.

2.    Design and construction standards for parking areas shall be reviewed by the City in accordance with the City’s adopted Street Standards. Wheelstops shall be provided for parking stalls abutting landscape areas, buildings or any nonmotorized corridors, including walkways. Wheelstops shall be positioned eighteen (18) inches into the parking stall; however, stalls may overhang up to eighteen (18) inches beyond a curb line into a landscaped area without a wheelstop, provided parking shall not intrude into required landscape planters or block the required width of a walkway.

H.    Compact Car Stalls:

1.    Number Permitted: Up to sixty (60) percent of required parking may be sized for compact car stalls; provided, that compact spaces are not located along a fire lane. The designation of compact stalls must be included on the site plan.

2.    Size: Compact car stalls shall not be less than nine (9) feet by fifteen (15) feet for ninety (90) degree head-in stalls.

I.    Barrier-Free Spaces: The property owner shall provide parking and access, including appropriate dimensions, in accordance with the Washington State Amendments to the Uniform Building Code, Chapter 11, Regulations for Barrier-Free Facilities, as currently written or amended. These parking requirements shall not be calculated as additional parking stalls to the requirement established in the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.050).

1.    Accessible parking spaces shall be located on the shortest possible accessible route of travel to an accessible building entrance. In facilities with multiple accessible building entrances with adjacent parking, accessible parking spaces shall be dispersed and located near the accessible entrances. Whenever practical, the accessible route of travel shall not cross lanes of vehicular traffic. Where crossing traffic lanes is necessary, the route of travel shall be designated and marked as a crosswalk. Exception: In multilevel parking structures, all accessible van parking spaces may be located on the same level.

2.    Where a parking facility is not accessory to a particular building, accessible parking spaces shall be located on the shortest accessible route to an accessible pedestrian entrance to the parking facility.

J.    Inner Circulation Required: Vehicle circulation for all parking areas on the site shall be contained within the proposed parking area.

K.    Stacking Spaces/Drive-Through Window Facility: A stacking space shall be an area measuring eight (8) feet by twenty (20) feet with direct forward access to a service window of a drive-through facility. Individual spaces within the lane may not be delineated with pavement markings. Stacking lanes may not be located within required driveway, internal circulation drive or parking aisle widths, and may not interfere with site circulation.

1.    Requirements: Uses providing drive-up or drive-through services shall provide vehicle stacking spaces as follows:

	Table 18.09.090: Minimum Required Stacking Spaces/Drive-Through Window Facility

	Drive-Through Use	One Window	Two Windows	Three + Windows

	Drive-Through Food/Beverage Service	5 stacking spaces	4 stacking spaces per window	3 stacking spaces per window

	Drive-Through Bank/Financial Institution, Business Service, or Other Drive-Through Use Not Listed	4 stacking spaces	3 stacking spaces per window	2 stacking spaces per window

2.    Parking Credit: Credit towards minimum parking requirements should be given for each drive-through station. One-third (1/3) parking credit should be given for each stacking space; provided, that the terms related to the provision and design of stacking space are met. For example, two (2) drive-through windows with three (3) stacking spaces each equals six (6); six (6) divided by one-third (1/3) equals two (2) parking spaces credited to the total parking requirement, as established on the Table of Off-Street Parking Standards.

3.    Administrative Adjustment: Exceptions to this requirement may be permitted through an Administrative Adjustment of Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.060) if an applicant can document that less than the required minimum stacking spaces would be ample during prime operating hours of the development.

L.    Landscaping and Screening:

1.    Required: The property owner shall provide landscaping and screening as required in Chapter 18.12 IMC, Landscaping and Tree Preservation.

2.    Reserved Parking in Landscaping: If reserved parking is approved by the Planning Director/Manager, the property owner shall provide landscaping in the reserved parking area as required. Landscaping in the reserved parking area does not count toward the required landscaping requirement for that site. See Delay of Installation/Reserved Parking for more information (IMC 18.09.080(B)(2)).

3.    Parking Which Abuts Residential: Every parking area in a non-single family project abutting property in any residential district shall be separated from such property by a solid wall, view-obstructing fence, or compact evergreen hedge at least six (6) feet in height. The screening shall be provided and maintained along the property line of such lot except in the required front setback.

M.    Nonmotorized Facilities: Nonmotorized facilities shall be provided consistent with Chapter 18.07 IMC, Required Development and Design Standards.

N.    Repair and Maintenance of Required Parking and Circulation Areas: The property owner shall maintain in perpetuity all parking and circulation areas in a safe, functional, and well-maintained condition that meets all applicable standards and project approvals. (Ord. 2587 § 3 (Exh. B2), 2010; Ord. 2560 § 6 (Exh. A5), 2009; Ord. 2543 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 5, 2007; Ord. 2447 § 58, 2005; Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 9.9, 1996).

(Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000).


18.09.100 Temporary parking.

A.    Special Events: Temporary parking for special events is addressed through the Special Events Street Use Permit process (Chapter 5.14 IMC).

B.    Requirements for Construction: 

1.    A temporary gravel or unimproved parking area requires a Special Events Street Use Permit.

2.    Temporary parking must have a setback of twenty (20) feet from existing streets.

3.    All temporary parking areas shall comply with National Fire Protection Association standards.

C.    Exceptions: Produce stands and Christmas tree stands are exempt from obtaining a Special Events Street Use Permit for parking; however, they shall be processed through the review pursuant to the Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130). (Ord. 2108 § 9.10, 1996).


18.09.110 Loading spaces.

A.    Purpose of Required Loading Spaces: The purpose of requiring loading spaces is to provide for adequate room entirely on-site and off any traffic circulation routes for the loading and unloading of commercial vehicles which are associated with the proposed development.

B.    When required: Whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area shall be provided to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner.

C.    Defined: Type A Loading Space shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet in depth and ten (10) feet in width. Type B Loading Space shall be at least fifty (50) feet in depth and twelve (12) feet in width. All buildings with overhangs that project over loading spaces shall have a vertical overhang clearance of not less than fourteen (14) feet, exclusive of access aisle, platform or maneuvering area.

D.    Loading Space Requirements:

1.    Design: All required off-street loading facilities shall be designed such that vehicles engaging in loading or unloading activities shall not encroach upon or interfere with the right-of-way or public use of streets, alleys or sidewalks. Maneuvering space of not less than fifty-two (52) feet in length shall be provided adjacent to the loading dock, and this maneuvering space shall not include any area designated or used for off-street parking, storage or trash dumpsters.

2.    Other Parking Requirements: No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities.

3.    Computation of Required Loading Spaces:

TABLE 18.09.110 – COMPUTATION OF REQUIRED LOADING SPACES

	TYPE OF USE	TYPE A	TYPE B

	• COMMERCIAL: 30,000 sf or less

	Retail, Restaurant, etc.	- 1 loading space for first 10,000 sf

- 1 loading space for next 20,000 sf	 

	Office	- 1 loading space	 

	• COMMERCIAL: More than 30,000 sf

	Retail, Restaurant, etc.	- 1 loading space per 30,000 sf	- 1 loading space per 30,000 sf

	Office	- 1 loading space per 30,000 sf	 

	• SCHOOLS

	Elementary, Junior and Senior High, and others having food service	- 1 loading space per food service operation	 

4.    Exceptions: Exceptions to loading space requirements may be permitted through the Administrative Adjustment of Parking Standards (IMC 18.09.060). (Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 9.11, 1996).


18.09.120 Transportation Management Plan (TMP).

A TMP is a contract between the City and a property owner or manager or an employer or group of employers stating that the employer(s) will provide education, opportunities, and employee incentives for ride sharing, parking incentives and other transportation alternatives. The TMP also addresses the responsibility of the property owner or manager or employer(s) for monitoring the success of the TMP, and reporting the annual results to the City.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of requiring a TMP for certain uses and all projects over a specific size/density is to promote the use of transportation alternatives which lessen traffic congestion, lessen the impact on the City’s air quality, and use the City’s existing infrastructure more efficiently.

B.    When Required: A TMP is required for individual projects, pursuant to the City’s adopted transportation management regulations. (Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 9.12, 1996).


18.09.130 Olde Town parking provisions.

A.    Parking Reductions in the CBD Zoning District: Parking requirements for all uses located in the CBD zone may be reduced by as much as twenty-five (25) percent as follows:

1.    General Reduction: Parking requirements for all uses in the CBD zone shall be reduced by fifteen (15) percent in order to encourage redevelopment and promote pedestrian systems.

2.    Shared Parking: An additional ten (10) percent of the required number of spaces for shared parking may be reduced in the CBD zone when the provisions of IMC 18.09.070(C), Shared Parking, are met.

B.    Additional Provisions within Olde Town: The following provisions apply to the CBD zone and MF-H zone (along E. Sunset Way only).

1.    Change of Use: No additional parking shall be required for a change in use for an existing structure or the use of previously unused space within an existing structure.

2.    Additions: No additional parking shall be required for structural additions that are ten (10) percent or less of the original gross floor area of the building. Additional parking shall be provided in accordance with Chapter 18.09 IMC for any structure addition that exceeds ten (10) percent of the original gross floor area. (Ord. 2911 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 2549 § 4, 2009; Ord. 2311 § 8, 2001; Ord. 2283 § 3, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 9.13, 1996).


18.09.140 Electric vehicle charging parking provisions.

For every electric vehicle charging station provided, the required number of parking spaces may be reduced by an equivalent number, provided the total reduction does not exceed five (5) percent of the total required parking spaces. For example, if forty (40) parking spaces are required and two (2) electric vehicle charging stations are provided, the total required parking may be reduced to thirty-eight (38) spaces, yielding thirty-six (36) “regular” parking spaces and two (2) electric vehicle charging parking spaces. Note that in this example the total reduction may not be in excess of two (2) spaces (40 * 5% = 2), so if three (3) electric vehicle charging stations were provided instead, the total reduction in required parking would still be two (2) spaces, yielding thirty-five (35) “regular” parking spaces and three (3) electric vehicle charging parking spaces. (Ord. 2624 § 5 (Exh. A4b), 2011).1

Any applicant may apply for an Administrative Adjustment of Parking Standards pursuant to Chapter 18.09 IMC.

2. Not operated as a home occupation.

3. Guest parking for multifamily residential uses and senior housing is included in the standard and is assumed to be one-quarter (1/4) space per unit.

18.10.080 Categorical exemptions and threshold determinations – Time estimates.

The time estimates contained in this section apply when the City processes licenses for all private projects and governmental proposals, for which the City is acting as lead agency for purposes of this chapter.

A.    Categorical Exemptions: The City will normally identify whether an action is categorically exempt within seven (7) days of receiving a completed application. The Planning Director/Manager shall certify when an application is complete based on review of the environmental checklist. If additional information is required to supplement the checklist, the application shall not be certified complete until the required information is received by the Planning Director/Manager.

B.    Threshold Determinations: It is the policy of the City to make a threshold determination on a completed application within ninety (90) days after the application and supporting documentation are complete.

C.    Complete Application: A complete application for a threshold determination consists of the following information:

1.    The proposed action:

a.    A description of the proposed action,

b.    Site information, including site plans, vicinity maps, and other information required for a land use certification or other Development/Land Use Permit application;

2.    The environmental checklist;

3.    Additional information/environmental checklist (WAC 197-11-335). The environmental checklist covers sixteen (16) subjects. If after review of the environmental checklist it is determined that there is insufficient information to make a threshold determination, additional information will be required using any one (1) or more of the following:

a.    The applicant will provide more information on subjects in the checklist,

b.    The City makes its own further study,

c.    The City will consult with other agencies, requesting information on the proposal’s potential impacts which lie within other agencies’ jurisdiction or expertise.

D.    Certification of Completeness: The Planning Director/Manager shall certify when an application is complete based on review of the environmental checklist. If additional information is required to supplement the checklist, the application shall not be certified until the required information is received by the Planning Director/Manager. Under state law and City policy, an applicant’s proposal must receive a determination of significance or nonsignificance within the ninety (90) day period, subject to the following:

1.    The applicant may request an additional thirty (30) days for the threshold determination.

2.    It is the policy of the City that adequate information must be provided before a decision can be made. The City will not accept, nor commence processing, environmental checklists which are not deemed complete.

3.    The City will normally complete threshold determinations on actions where the applicant recommends in writing than an EIS be prepared, because of the probable significant adverse environmental impacts described in the application, within fifteen (15) working days of receiving a completed application.

4.    The responsible official will normally respond to a request for early notice within ten (10) working days. The threshold determination will normally be made within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the changed or clarified proposal, environmental checklist and/or permit application. (Ord. 2108 § 10.1.8, 1996; Ord. 1954 § 1, 1992; Ord. 1633 § 8, 1984).


18.10.090 Integration with permit and land use decision.

Under state law, the procedure for review of Project Permits shall be combined with the environmental review process, both procedural and substantive. The process under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and this chapter shall integrate the following procedures, insofar as possible, with any applicable process for decision-making on permit and land use applications:

A.    Staff review of the application under City codes and regulations and the environmental review and determination thereon;

B.    The staff report on the application, and the report or documentation concerning environmental review;

C.    Hearings and other public processes, including required public notices, required by City code or regulation, and hearings and other public processes, including public notices, required or conducted under SEPA. This section shall include appeals, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Code;

D.    Such other review processes as the Planning Director/Manager shall determine. (Ord. 2108 § 10.1.9, 1996; Ord. 1954 § 2, 1992).


18.10.100 Categorical exemptions – Adoption by reference.

18.10.120 Categorical exemptions – Determination.

A.    When the City receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, a department initiates a proposal, the responsible official shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter shall apply to the proposal. The City shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

B.    In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible official shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental license required. If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the responsible official shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the consideration is exempt.

C.    Existing Documents May Provide Sufficient Environmental Protection:

1.    The City shall review the Project Permit application to determine whether existing documents may provide sufficient environmental protection and shall:

a.    Determine whether the applicable regulations require studies that adequately analyze all of the Project Permit application’s specific probable adverse environmental impacts;

b.    Determine if the applicable regulations require measures that adequately address such environmental impacts;

c.    Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the Project Permit application should be conditioned with additional mitigation measures;

d.    Provide prompt and coordinated review by government agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan or development regulation level;

e.    Review and document consistency with Comprehensive Plan and Land Use Code development regulations.

2.    In its review of a Project Permit application, the City may determine, pursuant to the criteria of RCW 43.21C.240(1) and (2), the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan and/or in other applicable local, state or federal laws provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the application.

3.    If the City’s Comprehensive Plans, subarea plans, and development regulations adequately address a project’s probable specific adverse environmental impacts, as determined under subsection (C)(1) of this section, or RCW 43.21C.240(1) and (2), the City shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review.

4.    A comprehensive plan, development regulation or other applicable local, state or federal law provides adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of an application when:

a.    The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or

b.    The City has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards or other land use planning required or allowed by Chapter 36.70A RCW.

5.    In its decision whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the City shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. In making this deferral, the City shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.

6.    Nothing in this section limits the authority of the City in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided in Chapter 43.21C RCW.

D.    Planned Actions:

1.    A planned action does not require a threshold determination or the preparation of an environmental impact statement under SEPA, but is subject to environmental review and mitigation under SEPA.

2.    A “planned action” means one (1) or more types of project action that:

a.    Are designated planned actions by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the City;

b.    Have had the significant impacts adequately addressed in an environmental impact statement prepared in conjunction with:

(1)    A comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, or

(2)    A fully contained community, a master planned resort, a master planned development or a phased project;

c.    Are subsequent or implementing projects for the proposals listed in subsection (D)(2)(b) of this section;

d.    Are located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030;

e.    Are not essential public facilities, as defined in RCW 36.70A.200; and

f.    Are consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW.

3.    Limitations on Planned Actions: The City shall limit planned actions to certain types of development or to specific geographical areas that are less extensive than the jurisdictional boundaries of the City, and may limit a planned action to a time period identified in the environmental impact statement or the adoption of this Code.

E.    If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the City may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

1.    The City shall not give authorization for:

a.    Any nonexempt action,

b.    Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact, or

c.    Any action that would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives;

2.    The City may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if the nonexempt actions were not approved; and

3.    The City may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if the nonexempt actions were not approved.

F.    Periodic Review: The periodic review of mineral resource operations pursuant to Chapter 18.05 IMC is categorically exempt as an ongoing enforcement and inspection activity; provided, that there are no material changes in the scope of work occurring at the mineral resource site. WAC 197-11-800(13). Material changes in the scope of work will be reviewed in accordance with IMC Table 18.06.130 and may require environmental review. (Ord. 2233 § 16, 1999; Ord. 2108 § 10.1.12, 1996; Ord. 1633 § 11, 1984).


18.10.130 Threshold determination – Review at conceptual stage.

A.    If the City’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a Building Permit or other licenses that require detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the City conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications.

B.    In addition to the environmental documents, an applicant shall submit the following information for early environmental review:



1.    The material required for a Site Development Permit or other Project Permit application submittal;

2.    Other information as the responsible official may determine;

3.    If the only action is a decision on a permit for excavation, clearing and/or grading of land, the plans and specifications required by the City for a Clearing and Grading Permit shall be submitted for early environmental review. (Ord. 2108 § 10.1.13, 1996; Ord. 1633 § 12, 1984).


18.10.140 Threshold determination – Environmental checklist.

A.    Filing Environmental Checklist: A completed environmental checklist shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not exempted by this chapter. The checklist shall be in the form of WAC 197-11-960 with such additions that may be required by the responsible official in accordance with WAC 197-11-906(4).

B.    Environmental Checklist Not Needed: A checklist is not needed if the City and the applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency.

C.    Environmental Checklist to Determine Lead Agency: The City shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the City is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

D.    Completing Environmental Checklist: For private proposals, the applicant is required to complete the environmental checklist as required in WAC 197-11-315(2). The City may provide assistance as necessary. For City proposals the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

E.    City to Complete Environmental Checklist: The City may decide to complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal under WAC 197-11-315(2), if either of the following occurs:

1.    The City has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

2.    The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 2108 § 10.1.14, 1996; Ord. 1633 § 13, 1984).


18.10.145 Optional DNS process.

A.    If the responsible official has a reasonable basis for determining that significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely, the responsible official may elect to use the single integrated comment period set forth in this section. If this process is used, a second comment period will typically not be required when the DNS is issued.

B.    If the optional process set forth in this section is used, the responsible official shall:

1.    State on the first page of the notice of application that is expects to issue a DNS for the proposal, and that:

a.    The optional DNS process is being used;

b.    This may be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposal;

c.    The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared;

d.    A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific proposal may be obtained upon request (in addition, the City may maintain a general mailing list for threshold determination distribution);

2.    List in the notice of application the conditions being considered to mitigate environmental impacts, if a mitigated DNS is expected;

3.    Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public notice in RCW 36.70B.110; and

4.    Send the notice of application and environmental checklist to:

a.    Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal; and

b.    Anyone requesting a copy of the environmental checklist for the specific proposal (in addition, the City may maintain a general mailing list for checklist distribution).

C.    If the responsible official indicates on the notice of application that a DNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status during the comment period on the notice of application in accordance with IMC 18.10.060, WAC 197-11-940 and 197-11-948.

D.    The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice of application and either:

1.    Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with no comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section;

2.    Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with a comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section, if the responsible official determines a comment period is necessary;

3.    Issue a DS; or

4.    Require additional information or studies prior to making a threshold determination.

E.    If a DNS or mitigated DNS is issued under subsection (D)(1) or (2) of this section, the responsible official shall send a copy of the DNS or mitigated DNS to the Department of Ecology, agencies with jurisdiction, those who commented, and anyone requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental checklist need not be recirculated. (Ord. 2185 § 6, 1998).


18.10.150 Threshold determination – Mitigated DNS.

A.    The responsible official may issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official, or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B.    An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely. The request must:

1.    Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the City is lead agency; and

2.    Precede the City’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C.    The responsible official’s response to the request for early notice shall:

1.    State whether the City currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific areas of concern that are leading the City to consider a DS; and

2.    State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, and may revise the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D.    When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised environmental checklist, the City shall base its threshold determination on a changed or clarified proposal.

1.    If the City indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the City shall issue and circulate a determination of nonsignificance if the City determines that no additional information or mitigation measures are required.

2.    If the City indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the City shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3.    The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures, clarifications, changes, or conditions must be in writing and must be specific.

4.    Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies, or other documents.

E.    Comment Period: The City shall not act upon a proposal for which a mitigated DNS has been issued for fourteen (14) days after the date of issuance.

F.    Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the licensing decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any matter specifically prescribed by the City. Failure to comply with the designated mitigation measures shall be grounds for suspension and/or revocation of any license issued.

G.    If the City’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the City should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) relating to the withdrawal of a DNS.

H.    The City’s response under subsection B of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarification or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the City to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 2185 § 7, 1998; Ord. 2108 § 10.1.15, 1996; Ord. 1633 § 14, 1984).

A.    The best available maps, special studies, and other information provided with the application and/or provided in accordance with the critical areas ordinance, Shoreline Master Program and other regulations shall designate the location of environmentally critical areas within the City. For each environmentally critical area, the exemptions within WAC 197-11-800 that are inapplicable for that area are WAC 197-11-800(1), (2)(b), (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), (2)(f), (2)(g), (2)(h), (6)(a), (14)(c), (24)(a) through (g), (25)(d), (25)(f), (25)(h), and (25)(i). Unidentified exemptions shall continue to apply within environmentally critical areas of the City.

B.    The responsible official shall designate additional environmentally critical areas under the standards of WAC 197-11-908, and shall file maps designating such areas, together with the exemptions from the list in WAC 197-11-908 that are inapplicable in such areas, with the Washington State Department of Ecology, Headquarters Office, Olympia, Washington. The environmentally critical area designation shall have full force and effect of law as of the date of filing.

C.    The City shall treat proposals located wholly or partially within an environmentally critical area no differently than other proposals under this chapter, making a threshold determination for all such proposals. The City shall not automatically require an EIS for a proposal merely because it is proposed for location in an environmentally critical area.

D.    Certain exemptions do not apply on lands covered by water, and this remains true regardless of whether or not lands covered by water are mapped. (Ord. 2501 § 22, 2007; Ord. 2108 § 10.1.30, 1996; Ord. 1633 § 30, 1984).


18.10.310 Fees.

The City shall require the following fees for its activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter:

A.    Threshold Determination: For every environmental checklist the City will review when it is lead agency, the City shall collect a fee of $150.00 from the proponent of the proposal prior to undertaking a basic threshold determination. The time periods provided by this chapter for making a threshold determination shall not begin to run until payment of fees. When the City assists the applicant or completes the environmental checklist at the applicant’s request or under IMC 18.10.140 (Threshold Determination – Environmental Checklist), or when the environmental review of the proposal is complex, the fee for making a threshold determination shall be $350.00. For any complex review requiring staff time in excess of ten (10) hours, the City shall charge an hourly rate of $60.00 for the additional time.

B.    Environmental Impact Statement:

1.    When the City is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS and the responsible official determines that the EIS shall be prepared by employees of the City, the City may charge and collect a reasonable fee from any applicant to cover costs incurred, including overhead, by the City in preparing the EIS. The responsible official shall advise the applicant of the projected costs for the EIS prior to actual preparation.

2.    The responsible official may determine that the City will contract directly with a consultant for preparation of an EIS, or a portion of the EIS, for activities initiated by some persons or entity other than the City, and may bill such costs and expenses directly to the applicant. Such consultants shall be selected by the City.

3.    The applicant shall pay the projected amount to the City prior to commencing work. The City will refund the excess, if any, at the completion of the EIS. If the City’s costs exceed the projected costs, the applicant shall immediately pay the excess. If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the responsible official shall refund any fees collected under subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section which remain after incurred costs, including overhead, are paid.

4.    For all proposals in which the City is the lead agency and the responsible official determines that an EIS is required, the applicant shall be charged $500.00 or a fee equal to five (5) percent of the costs of the draft and the final environmental impact statements, whichever is greater, to cover the City’s administrative costs of supervision and preparation. For the purpose of this section, cost of an environmental impact statement shall include the cost of preparation and publication, including printing, collating, binding, and circulation of the preliminary and final EIS. Applicants may be required to post bond or otherwise insure payment of such costs. In the event the actual cost of the draft and final EIS exceeds the estimated cost of the EIS agreed upon by the City and the applicant, such excess shall be paid to the City by the applicant prior to final action by the City.

C.    The City may collect a reasonable fee from an applicant to cover the costs of meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the applicant’s proposal.

D.    The City may charge any person for copies of any document prepared under this chapter, and for mailing the document in a manner provided by Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 2108 § 10.1.31, 1996; Ord. 1856 § 1, 1990; Ord. 1633 § 31, 1984).

Critical Areas Regulations


18.10.340 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to identify environmentally critical areas and to supplement the development requirements contained in the various use classifications in the Issaquah Municipal Code by providing for additional controls without violating any citizen’s constitutional rights. (Ord. 2108 § 10.2.1, 1996).


18.10.350 Intent.

It is the intent of the City to balance the community vision which includes:

A.    Environmental protection and preservation;

B.    Diversified economic growth which has been planned and which is compatible with the vision of the community; and

C.    Overall improvement of the quality of life for the residents of Issaquah.

The City shall implement this vision through directing appropriate development to areas of the City in which the development will have the least adverse impact to the environment. High impact land use shall be located in areas that will have the least detrimental adverse effect to environmentally critical areas. In areas that development may have a substantial risk to potentially, adversely impact environmentally critical areas, only low impact land use shall be permitted. (Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2233 § 17, 1999; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.2, 1996).


18.10.360 Environmentally critical areas.

Coal mines, streams, wetlands, lakes, steep slopes, protective buffers, watersheds, aquifer recharge areas, as well as areas subject to erosion, flooding, landslides, and seismic hazards, constitute environmentally critical areas that are of special concern to the City. The standards and mechanisms established in this chapter are intended to protect these environmentally critical areas in Issaquah. By regulating development and alterations to critical areas, this chapter seeks to:

A.    Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, property damage or financial losses due to flooding, erosion, landslides and seismic events, soil subsidence and steep slope failures;

B.    Protect unique, fragile and valuable elements of the environment including wildlife and its habitat;

C.    Mitigate unavoidable impacts to environmentally critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas;

D.    Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water availability, water quality, wetlands and streams;

E.    Minimize erosion potential;

F.    Avoid alteration to wetland hydrology that causes either short- or long-term changes in native vegetational composition, soils characteristics, nutrient cycling or water chemistry;

G.    Protect the public trust as to navigable waters and aquatic resources;

H.    Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and maintain Issaquah as an eligible community for federal flood insurance benefits;

I.    Alert members of the public including, but not limited to, appraisers, owners, potential buyers or lessees to the development limitations of critical areas;

J.    Provide City officials with sufficient information to protect critical areas;

K.    Implement the policies of the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, the Issaquah Municipal Code, the City of Issaquah Comprehensive Plan and the Shoreline Master Program; and

L.    Educate the public about the long-term care of critical areas. (Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2500 § 5, 2007; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.3, 1996).


18.10.370 Applicability.

A.    The regulations and standards of the Issaquah Municipal Code and the Land Use Code pertaining to the several use classifications shall be subject to the general provisions, requirements, and conditions contained in this chapter. When any provision of any chapter of the Issaquah Municipal Code, Shoreline Master Program or the Land Use Code conflicts with this chapter, that provision which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter. The provisions of this Code shall prevail over any inconsistent ordinance that has not been reviewed for compliance with the City’s GMA Comprehensive Plan. Streams and wetlands classified under the City of Issaquah Shoreline Master Program shall be governed by the rules and regulations pertaining to setbacks and buffer requirements under that ordinance only when a critical area study documents that the smaller buffer required through the Shoreline Master Program would not cause significant impacts to the stream or wetlands. Development for which the City of Issaquah Shoreline Master Program is applicable will still be governed by and need to conform to regulations, other than buffer and setback requirements, as set forth in this Code, including: flood storage capacity; flood-proofing measures, etc.

B.    The provisions of this Code shall be held to be the minimum requirements in their interpretation in order to serve the purposes of this chapter.

C.    The City, prior to fulfilling the requirements of this chapter, shall not grant any approval or permission to alter the condition of any land, water or vegetation, or to construct or alter any structure or improvement including, but not limited to, the following: Commercial or Residential Building Permits or other land use actions; Right-of-Way Construction Permits; Grading and Clearing permits; Right-of-Way Permits; Shoreline Conditional Use Permits; shoreline environmental redesignations; Shoreline Substantial Development Permits; shoreline variances; short subdivisions; subdivisions; utility and other use permits; variances; zone reclassifications; or any subsequently adopted permits or required approvals not expressly exempted by this chapter.

D.    The City shall perform a critical areas review for any permit or approval requested for a development proposal on a site which includes or is adjacent to one (1) or more critical areas, unless otherwise provided in this chapter. The critical area review requires, at a minimum, that the following review process occur, as part of all development applications:

1.    The City shall review the information submitted by the applicant to:

a.    Confirm the nature and type of the critical areas and evaluate the critical areas study;

b.    Determine whether the development proposal is consistent with this chapter;

c.    Determine whether any proposed alterations to critical areas are necessary;

d.    Determine if the mitigation and monitoring plans and bonding measures proposed by the applicant are sufficient to protect the public health, safety and welfare consistent with the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter;

e.    Determine if the proposed action warrants a biological assessment based on the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.

2.    The applicant shall submit an affidavit which:

a.    Declares that the applicant has no knowledge that critical areas on the proposed development site have been illegally altered; or

b.    Shall list all known alterations to the critical area.

3.    The applicant shall demonstrate that any development proposal submitted conforms to the purposes, standards and protection mechanisms of this chapter.

4.    The development proposal shall, if required, contain a critical areas study in accordance with IMC 18.10.400.

E.    The City may approve, approve with conditions, or deny any development proposal in order to comply with the requirements and carry out the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter.

F.    It shall be the responsibility of the Director to implement the policies and objectives of this Code.

G.    All decisions in regards to this chapter shall be made through the appropriate land use permitting process or as noted in this chapter. In the event that the proposal, as it relates to this chapter, does not require any other related or unrelated permits or approvals and this chapter does not specify a review process, it shall be reviewed by the City through the Level 1 Review process.

H.    The Director is authorized to adopt written procedures and establish administrative rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Code.

I.    The Director shall maintain and make available to the public all available information applicable to any critical area and its buffer.

J.    The Director shall on an annual basis establish a list of qualified professional scientists and technical experts to assist in the implementation of the provisions of this Code.

K.    Approval of a development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

L.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all forest practices over which the City has jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 76.09 RCW, WAC Title 222, and any Memorandum of Understanding between the Washington Department of Natural Resources and the City. In addition, this chapter shall apply to all property which has been cleared and/or graded without an approved forest practice application and which is subsequently proposed for development. (Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.4, 1996).


18.10.380 Agency resource maps.

A.    The approximate location and estimated extent of critical areas in the City are displayed on the Issaquah Natural Resources and Critical Areas Map Folios, the National Wetlands Inventory, the Issaquah Shoreline Environment Designation Maps and any other pertinent maps the City utilizes as resource material. These maps are to be used as a guide to the general location and extent of critical areas.

B.    It is presumed that critical areas not shown on these maps may exist in the City. These critical areas not currently mapped are protected under all the provisions of this Code.

C.    In the event that any of the critical area designations shown on the maps conflict with the criteria set forth in this chapter, the criteria shall control.

D.    Any areas which are requesting to be annexed to the City shall be required to perform a critical areas inventory as a requirement of annexation. (Ord. 2108 § 10.2.5, 1996).


18.10.390 Definitions.

If any definition in this chapter conflicts with definitions in the Shoreline Master Program (SMP), the definitions in the SMP shall take precedence where applied to areas inside shoreline jurisdiction.

Adjacent: For the purpose of critical areas, within one hundred (100) feet of a critical area, or more, as decided by the Director, if development of the property may impact the critical area.

Alteration: Any human-induced action which adversely impacts the existing condition of a critical area. Alterations include, but are not limited to, grading; filling; dredging; draining; channeling; cutting, pruning, limbing or topping, clearing, relocating or removing vegetation; applying herbicides or pesticides or any hazardous or toxic substance; discharging pollutants (excluding treated storm water); grazing domestic animals; paving (including construction and application of gravel); modifying for surface water management purposes; or any other human activity that adversely impacts the existing vegetation, hydrology, wildlife or wildlife habitat. Alteration does not include walking, passive recreation, fishing or other similar activities.

Applicant: Any person or business entity which applies for a development proposal, permit or approval subject to review under this chapter.

Appropriate land use permitting process: The permitting process (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, Building Permit, Grading Permit, etc.) which the proposed project is proceeding through for approval. For instance, if a proposed project requires a Level 3 Review for approval, prior to the Building Permit stage, then the Level 3 process would be considered the “appropriate land use permitting process.”

Aquifer: A body of soil or rock that contains sufficient saturated material to conduct groundwater and yield usable quantities of groundwater to springs and/or wells.

Aquifer recharge area: Areas that are determined to have a recharging effect on aquifers used as a source for potable water, and are vulnerable to contamination from recharge.

Base flood: A flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. It is also referred to as the “one hundred (100) year flood.” The base flood is determined as defined by the latest FEMA FIRM maps. In areas where the Flood Insurance Study includes detailed base flood calculations, those calculations may be used until projections of future flows are completed and approved by the City.

Base flood elevation: The water surface elevation of the base flood. It shall be referenced to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929.

Best management practices: The physical, structural, and/or managerial practices that use the best available technologies or techniques, either separately or in combination, to prevent or reduce the degradation of any critical area or natural resources. For example, these conservation practices or systems of practices and management measures would:

A.    Control soil loss and reduce water quality degradation caused by nutrients, animal waste, toxins, and sediment; and

B.    Minimize adverse impacts to surface water and groundwater flow, circulation patterns, and to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of critical areas.

Biofiltration swale: A shallow drainage conveyance with relatively gentle side slopes, generally with flow depths less than one (1) foot which are designed to reduce pollutant concentrations in water by filtering the polluted water through biological materials.

Biological assessment (Endangered Species Act): An analysis of a proposed action by a qualified professional in order to determine if the action will result in a “take” of a threatened or endangered species, as listed under the Endangered Species Act.

Biologist: A person who has earned a degree in biological sciences from an accredited college or university, or a person who has equivalent educational training and has experience as a practicing biologist.

Building setback area: The area between the critical area buffer and the building setback line. This area is provided to ensure that the building and associated construction activities do not result in significant adverse impacts to the adjacent critical area, and to provide physical and/or visual separation between the development and the critical area.

Building setback line: A line which establishes a definite point beyond which the foundation of a structure shall not extend.

Canopy: The highest layer of vegetation within a forest community.

Wetland mitigation (compensatory): The compensation stage of the mitigation sequence where impacts to the functions and values of wetlands are replaced through creation or re-establishment, rehabilitation, or enhancement of other wetlands. Types of compensatory mitigation include:

A.    Creation (Establishment). The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics present to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site, where a wetland did not previously exist. Activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod, create hydric soils, and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species. Establishment results in a gain in wetland acres.

B.    Re-establishment. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. Activities could include removing fill material, plugging ditches or breaking drain tiles. Re-establishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions.

C.    Rehabilitation. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions and processes of a degraded wetland. Activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain, restoring tidal influence to a wetland, or breaking drain tiles and plugging drainage ditches. Rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres.

D.    Enhancement. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten, intensify or improve specific function(s) or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present. Enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement, flood water retention or wildlife habitat. Activities typically consist of planting vegetation, controlling nonnative or invasive species, modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods, or some combination of these. Enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions, but does not result in a gain in wetland acres.

Wetland professional: A professional scientist or technical expert who by training and/or experience is qualified to provide expertise in matters related to wetlands.

Wetlands: “Wetlands” means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

Wetpond: An artificial body of water dug as a part of a surface water management system. (Ord. 2783 § 5 (Exh. A5.b), 2016; Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh.

18.10.430 Variances.

A.    Applicability: The variance procedures herein apply to all property outside the jurisdiction of the Shoreline Master Program. Variances for development on property located within shoreline jurisdiction shall follow the variance process, standards and criteria listed in the Shoreline Master Program (SMP) and Appendix A of the SMP, Critical Area Regulations.

B.    Purpose: The variance provision is provided to property owners who, due to the strict implementation of this chapter and/or to unusual circumstances regarding the subject property, are deprived of privileges commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same vicinity, zone and under the same land use regulations or have been denied all reasonable use of the property; provided, however, that the fact that surrounding properties have been developed under regulations in force prior to the adoption of this Code shall not be the sole basis for the granting of a variance.

C.    Variance Granted: Before any variance may be granted, the applicant must file an application with the Permit Center and must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Hearing Examiner the ability to meet all of the criteria in subsection D of this section. In the event that the applicant is not able to fulfill all of the criteria in subsection D of this section, a demonstration must be made to the satisfaction of the Hearing Examiner, regarding the ability to successfully meet all of the criteria established in subsection E of this section.

A variance application shall be submitted to the Permit Center along with a critical areas special study, where applicable.

D.    Variance Criteria Established:

1.    The variance is in harmony with the purpose and intent of the relevant City ordinances and the Comprehensive Plan;

2.    The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege which would be inconsistent with the permitted uses, or other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located;

3.    That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity, located in the same zone as the subject property and developed under the same land use regulations as the subject property requesting the variance;

4.    That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated;

5.    That alternative development concepts that comply with the Code provisions to which the variance is requested have been evaluated, and that undue hardship would result if the strict adherence to the Code provisions were required;

6.    The variance granted is the minimum amount that will comply with the criteria listed above and the minimum necessary to accommodate the permitted uses proposed by the application, and the scale of the use shall be reduced as necessary to meet this requirement; and

7.    The need for the variance is not the result of actions of the applicant or property owner.

E.    Reasonable Use Variance Criteria Established: Only after the determination, by the Hearing Examiner, that the proposal does not meet all of the variance criteria listed above, may the application be reviewed, by the Hearing Examiner at the same public hearing, under the following criteria:

1.    There is no reasonable use of the property left; and

2.    That the granting of this variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; and

3.    The variance granted is the minimum amount that will comply with the criteria listed above and the minimum necessary to accommodate the permitted uses proposed by the application, and the scale of the use shall be reduced as necessary to meet this requirement; and

4.    The need for the variance is not the result of actions of the applicant or property owner.

F.    Wetland Buffer Variance: The Hearing Examiner may reduce wetland buffer widths beyond requirements of IMC 18.10.650 only through review and approval of a variance application. In addition to the variance requirements the applicant must demonstrate that:

1.    No direct or indirect, short-term or long-term, adverse impacts to wetlands would result from the proposed buffer reduction; and

2.    The project includes a wetland and/or wetland buffer enhancement plan using native vegetation which demonstrates that an enhanced buffer will improve the functional attributes of the buffer to provide additional protection for wetlands functions and values and that the new buffer will provide the same level of protection to the wetland as the original buffer.

G.    Cumulative Impact of Area Wide Requests: In the granting of variances from this Code, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances should also remain consistent with the policies and intent set forth in this chapter.

H.    Public Hearing: The Hearing Examiner shall hold a public hearing and notice shall be provided under the provisions of the Land Use Code and Issaquah Municipal Code. The applicant or representative(s) shall appear in person at the hearing.

I.    Notice of Hearing Examiner’s Decision: Copies of the Hearing Examiner’s decision shall be mailed to the applicant and to other parties of record not later than three (3) working days following the filing of the decision. “Parties of record” shall include the applicant and all other persons who specifically request notice of the decision by signing a register provided for such purpose at the public hearing.

J.    Appeals: Decisions by the Hearing Examiner may be appealed to the City Council in accordance with IMC 18.04.250, Administrative appeals. (Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.10, 1996).


18.10.440 Nonconforming activities.

Regulated activities approved prior to the adoption of this chapter but which are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter are subject to the provisions of Chapter 18.08 IMC. (Ord. 2108 § 10.2.11, 1996).


18.10.450 Density calculation in critical areas.

A.    The following formula for density calculations is designed to provide incentives for the preservation of critical areas and critical area buffers, flexibility in design, and consistent treatment of different types of development proposals. The formula shall apply to all properties on which critical areas such as streams, wetlands, steep slopes, and floodways of streams and associated critical area buffers limit land area available for development. The formula lists the maximum density credits that may be transferred on a particular site from the critical area to a developable site area. However, in some cases the maximum density credits may not be attainable due to other site constraints including but not limited to acreage constraints of the developable site area.

B.    For development proposals containing critical areas and associated critical area buffers that limit development, the Director shall determine allowable dwelling units for residential and allowable floor area for nonresidential or commercial development proposals based on the formulas below.

1.    Residential: The maximum number of dwelling units (DU) for a lot or parcel which contains critical areas and associated critical area buffers that limit development shall be equal to the number of acres in critical area and critical area buffer that limit development, times the number of dwelling units allowed per acre, times the percentage of density credit, plus the number of dwelling units allowed on the remainder of the site; or: (Max. DU) = (Acres in Critical Area and Critical Area Buffer) (DU/Acre) (Density Credit) + (DU allowed on remaining acreage of site).

2.    The density credit figure is derived from the following table:

	Density Credits

	Percentage of site in buffers and/or critical areas	translates into	Density Credit

	1 – 10%	 	100%

	11 – 20%	 	90%

	21 – 30%	 	80%

	31 – 40%	 	70%

	41 – 50%	 	60%

	51 – 60%	 	50%

	61 – 70%	 	40%

	71 – 80%	 	30%

	81 – 90%	 	20%

	91 – 100%	 	10%

3.    The density credit can only be transferred within the development proposal site. The applicant may reduce lot sizes below the minimum required for that zone to accommodate the transfer of density. The applicant may not propose any uses which are not permitted in the underlying zone.

To the extent that application of the formula may result in lot sizes less than the minimum allowed by the underlying district, they are hereby authorized; provided, that the resultant lot is of sufficient size for an on-site waste disposal system if no sanitary sewer system exists. In any case, all other established setbacks shall be required, pursuant to Chapter 18.07 IMC.

4.    Nonresidential: The maximum nonresidential or commercial square footage will be determined by the site constraints, including but not limited to: critical areas, associated critical area buffers, impervious surface ratio, height, setbacks, parking requirements, etc. (Ord. 2525 § 7, 2008; Ord. 2447 § 59, 2005; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.12, 1996).


18.10.460 Notice on title.

A.    The owner of any property containing critical areas or buffers on which a development proposal is submitted, except for a public right-of-way or the site of a permanent public facility, shall file for record with the Records and Elections Division of King County a notice approved by the City. Such notice shall provide documentation in the public record of the presence of a critical area or buffer, the application of this chapter to the property, and that limitations on actions in or affecting such areas or buffers may exist. The required contents and form of the notice shall be set forth in administrative rules.

B.    The applicant shall submit proof that the notice has been filed for record before the City shall approve any development proposal for such site or, in the case of subdivisions, short subdivisions and binding site plans, at or before recording. The notice shall run with the land and failure to provide such notice to any purchaser prior to transferring any interest in the property shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2108 § 10.2.13, 1996).

1.    Critical area tracts are legally created tracts containing critical areas and their buffers that shall remain undeveloped in perpetuity. Critical area tracts are an integral part of the lot in which they are created, are not intended for sale, lease or transfer, and shall be included in the area of the parent lot for purposes of subdivision method and minimum lot size.

2.    Permanent survey stakes using iron or cement markers as established by current survey standards shall be set delineating the boundaries between adjoining properties and the critical area tracts.

B.    Protection of Critical Area Tracts: The Director shall require, as a condition of any permit issued pursuant to this Code, that the critical area tract or tracts created pursuant to this section be protected by one of the following methods:

1.    The permit holder shall convey an irrevocable offer to dedicate to the City or other public or nonprofit entity specified by the Director, a native growth protective easement for the protection of native vegetation within a critical area and/or its buffer; or

2.    The permit holder shall establish and record a permanent and irrevocable deed restriction on the property title of all lots containing a critical area tract or tracts created as a condition of this permit. Such deed restriction(s) shall prohibit in perpetuity the development, alteration, or disturbance of vegetation within the critical area tract except for purposes of habitat enhancement as part of an enhancement project that has received prior written approval from the City, and any other agency with jurisdiction over such activity.

C.    Buffer Areas: Buffer areas shall be established from the outer edge of the critical area for wetlands, streams, steep slope hazard areas and landslide hazard areas, as determined by the Director, through review of the critical areas study and based on the minimum buffer requirements set forth in the appropriate section of this Code.

Landscaping, with the exception of street trees, that occurs as a result of new development, shall not intrude into the buffer of any critical area, unless approved by the Director (through a Level 1 Review or through the appropriate land use permitting process). Street trees, consistent with the City “Street Tree Master Program” and approved by the Director, shall be allowed in and along the roadway rights-of-way portion of a critical area buffer. When critical area buffers overlap, the largest buffer width shall be applied to ensure adequate protection for each critical area.

D.    Building Setback Areas: A minimum fifteen (15) foot building setback area shall be established from the outer edge of the critical area buffer for wetlands, streams, steep slope hazard areas and landslide hazard areas.

1.    Prohibitions on the use of hazardous or toxic substances and pesticides or certain fertilizers in this area shall be imposed for setbacks from streams and wetlands.

2.    Where such alterations are approved, buffers and critical area tracts may also be altered. (Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.23, 1996).


18.10.570 Seismic hazard areas – Protection mechanisms and permitted alterations.

Development proposals on sites containing a seismic hazard area shall meet the requirements of this section. 

A.    Development proposals on-sites containing mapped seismic hazard areas may make alterations to a seismic hazard area only when the applicant demonstrates and the Director concludes that:

1.    Evaluation of site specific subsurface conditions show that the site is not located in a seismic hazard area; or

2.    Mitigation is implemented to the greatest extent feasible, and shall minimize any potential adverse impacts.

B.    Development proposals will be subject to two (2) levels of review standards based on occupancy types – critical facilities and standard structures. The review standards for critical facilities will be based on larger earthquake reoccurrence intervals than the earthquakes considered for standard occupancy structures. The review standards will be set forth in the administrative rules. (Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.24, 1996).


18.10.580 Steep slope hazard areas – Protection mechanisms and permitted alterations.

Steep slope hazard areas and associated buffers shall not be altered (see definition of “alteration,” IMC 18.10.390) except as expressly authorized below.

Development proposals on sites containing a steep slope hazard area shall meet the requirements of this section.

A.    Buffers:

1.    A minimum buffer shall be established at a horizontal distance of fifty (50) feet from the top or toe and along all sides of slopes forty (40) percent or steeper. Existing native vegetation within the buffer area shall be maintained and the buffer shall be extended beyond these limits as required to mitigate landslide and erosion hazards, or as otherwise necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

2.    The buffer may be reduced to a minimum of ten (10) feet when an applicant demonstrates to the Director, pursuant to a critical areas study, that the reduction will not reduce the level of protection to the proposed development and the critical area as provided by the fifty (50) foot buffer. An occupied building shall not be closer than twenty-five (25) feet (including buffer) to the toe of a steep slope (or altered steep slope).

3.    A decision by the Director to reduce the buffer shall be based on a critical area study that includes the following assessment criteria:

a.    Steep slope development areas shall be subject to site-specific geotechnical studies.

b.    Steep slope development areas shall be subject to engineering design considerations that ensure the stability of steep slope areas. Engineering design considerations shall include but are not limited to the following:

(1)    Soil cuts require slope stability analysis to evaluate the change in relative stability. Based on the results of the stability analysis, retaining structures will be required to replace any lateral soil support lost. In no case shall the factor of safety be less than one and one-half (1.5).

(2)    Soil fills require slope stability analysis and engineering design measures, including keying the fill, compaction, drainage measures, reinforced earth, and structural retaining walls.

(3)    Foundations must be extended to firm, undisturbed native soil, and embedded deep enough to resist lateral loads caused by soil creep (surficial slope movement inherent to all steep slope areas) and other lateral loads which the foundation may be subject to (i.e., seismic and deep seated slope failures).

(4)    Provide subgrade (i.e., reinforced compacted subgrade) or retaining wall design (rockeries are not considered retaining walls or engineered structures) that replaces the support of cuts; designed with a factor of safety of at least one and one-half (1.5). Compacted subgrade without reinforcement or retaining structures will not be considered for the support of cuts.

(5)    Provide effective, positive drainage for all underground elements of structures or facilities.

(6)    All utility connections within steep slope and landslide hazards shall have sufficient flexible connections to avoid utility failure.

c.    All geotechnical analyses prepared shall have a third-party independent review by a qualified geotechnical engineer.

4.    The decision by the Director to reduce the buffer shall include the following conditions:

a.    The applicant shall establish a mechanism that is acceptable to the Director which notifies all future buyers of the lot that the steep slope buffer was reduced and that development has occurred within fifty (50) feet of the steep slope or the steep slope has been eliminated (e.g., notice on title); and

b.    The applicant shall execute an agreement on a form approved by the City Attorney, which indemnifies and holds the City harmless for development within fifty (50) feet of the steep slope.

    Both conditions shall be met prior to the issuance of a Building Permit. The Director may attach additional conditions as necessary to achieve the purpose and intent of this section.

B.    Building Setback: An additional fifteen (15) foot building setback shall also be established from the outer edge of the buffer as regulated by IMC 18.10.515(D), Building Setback Areas.

C.    Critical Areas Tracts: Any continuous steep slope hazard area and its buffers one (1) acre or greater in size shall be placed in separate critical areas tracts in development proposals as described in IMC 18.10.515.

D.    Alterations: Alterations to steep slopes shall be allowed only as follows:

1.    Surface Water Management: Steep slopes may be used for approved surface water conveyance as specified in the City’s currently adopted Surface Water Design Manual. Installation techniques shall minimize disturbance to the slope and vegetation.

2.    Trails: Construction of public and private trails may be allowed on steep slopes, provided they receive site-specific approval by the City as guided by the construction and maintenance standards in the U.S. Forest Service “Trails Management Handbook” (FSH 2309.18, June 1987 as amended) and “Standard Specifications for Construction of Trails” (EM-7720-102, June 1984 as amended); but in no case shall trails be constructed of concrete, asphalt or other impervious surface which would contribute to surface water runoff unless such construction is necessary for soil stabilization or soil erosion prevention.

3.    Utilities: Construction of public and private utility corridors may be allowed on steep slopes in accordance with adopted standards. In the event that standards have not been adopted or are not applicable, the activity may be allowed; provided, that a critical areas study indicates that such alteration will not subject the area to the risk of landslide or erosion.

4.    View Corridors: The City may allow the limited trimming and limbing of vegetation on steep slopes for the creation and maintenance of views; provided, that the soils are not disturbed, plant health is not compromised, and the activity is subject to the applicable City ordinance.

E.    Limited Exemptions:

1.    Slopes forty (40) percent and steeper with a vertical elevation change of up to twenty (20) feet may be exempted from the provisions of this section (through Level 1 Review or through the appropriate land use permitting process), based on the City review and acceptance of a soils report prepared by a geologist or licensed geotechnical engineer when no adverse impact will result from the exemption.

2.    Any slope which has been created through previous, legal grading activities may be regarded as part of an approved development proposal. Any slope which remains equal to or in excess of forty (40) percent following site development shall be subject to the protection mechanisms for steep slopes.

F.    Removal or Introduction of Vegetation on Landslide or Steep Slopes: Unless otherwise specified, the following restrictions apply to vegetation removal or introduction in steep slope hazard areas, landslide hazard areas and their buffers:

1.    There shall be no removal of any vegetation from any steep slope hazard area or buffer except for the limited plant removal necessary for surveying purposes and for the removal of hazardous trees determined to be unsafe by the City Horticulturist or a private, qualified arborist.

2.    On slopes which have been disturbed by human activity or infested by noxious weeds, replacement with native species or other appropriate vegetation may be required subject to approval by the City of an enhancement plan. (Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2525 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.25, 1996).


18.10.590 Wetlands – General protection mechanisms.

Development activity on sites containing wetlands or wetland buffers shall meet the requirements of this chapter. Wetlands and associated buffers shall not be altered (see definition of “alteration,” IMC 18.10.390) except as expressly authorized by this chapter. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of all other agencies with jurisdiction have been met. (Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2455 § 4, 2006; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.26.1 – 4, 1996).


18.10.600 Regulated wetland activities.

Project Permit approval through the appropriate land use permitting process, or if none is required, then through Level 1 Review, shall be obtained from the City prior to undertaking the following activities in a regulated wetland or its buffer unless authorized by IMC 18.10.610(A):

(Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2455 § 5, 2006; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.26.5, 1996).


18.10.610 Allowed wetland activities.

A.    Activities Not Subject to Review or Approval: The following activities shall be allowed without a wetland reconnaissance or wetland study and without notice to the Director, within a wetland or wetland buffer to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they are conducted using best management practices, except where such activities result in the conversion of a regulated wetland or wetland buffer to an activity to which it was not previously subjected; and provided further, that forest practices and conversions shall be governed by Chapter 76.09 RCW and its rules. These activities are not subject to any review or approval process.

1.    Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife;

2.    Outdoor recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, hunting, boating, swimming and canoeing. Horseback riding and bicycling are allowed only on designated, established, public trails;

3.    The noncommercial harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions or water sources;

4.    Existing and ongoing agricultural activities including farming, horticulture, aquaculture, irrigation, ranching or grazing of animals. Activities on areas lying fallow as part of a conventional rotational cycle are part of an ongoing operation. Activities which bring an area into agricultural use are not part of an ongoing operation. An operation ceases to be ongoing when the area on which it was conducted has been converted to another use or has lain idle for twenty-four (24) consecutive months;

5.    The maintenance (but not construction) of existing ditches. Maintenance includes clearing the ditch of sediment, debris and/or vegetation, but does not include additional excavation that increases the depth or width of the ditch. Excavation of sediment deposited in the ditch shall not exceed the original construction elevation;

6.    Education, scientific research, and use of publicly designated nature trails;

7.    Navigation aids and boundary markers;

8.    Boat mooring buoys;

9.    Normal maintenance, repair, or operation of existing serviceable structures, facilities, or improved areas. Maintenance and repair does not include any modification that changes the character, scope, or size of the original structure, facility, or improved area and does not include the construction of a maintenance road;

10.    Minor modification of existing serviceable structures (e.g., utilities, monitoring equipment, etc.) within a buffer where modification does not adversely impact wetland functions;

11.    Site investigative work necessary for land use application submittals such as delineations, surveys, soil logs, percolation tests and other related activities; and

12.    Removal of exotic, invasive plants in wetlands and buffers as established in IMC 18.10.400(K), Removal of Nonnative Invasive Vegetation.

B.    Activities Allowed in Wetland Buffers: In wetland buffers, regulated activities which have minimal adverse impacts within the buffers and no adverse impacts on wetlands may be allowed through the land use permit process, provided they are conducted using best management practices and restoration. These activities include:

1.    Low impact, passive recreation-related activities such as development of pervious recreation trails, nonpermanent wildlife watching blinds, short-term scientific or educational activities; or

2.    Facilities having no feasible alternative on-site locations, where appropriate restoration is included, and which would not adversely affect the function or values of the buffer or wetland, may be allowed in wetland buffers. Stormwater facilities shall not encroach into wetland buffers by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the standard wetland buffer width, per IMC 18.10.640, or use more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total buffer area without a variance. Stormwater vaults located in wetland buffers shall have adequate soil cover to support native vegetation including small trees, shrubs and groundcover. Any wetland buffer area displaced by a stormwater management facility shall be compensated for by adding an equal wetland buffer area in accordance with wetland buffer averaging, IMC 18.10.650(D)(5), so that no net loss of wetland buffer area results from the construction of the facility. Stormwater facilities such as bioretention, rain gardens, or constructed wetlands planted with appropriate native vegetation and trees are allowed without buffer averaging requirements; or

3.    Flood conveyance compensatory storage, where there is no other feasible alternative, where appropriate restoration is included, and where wetland hydrology or vegetation will not be significantly impacted; or

4.    Surface water discharge to a wetland from a stormwater facility or other surface water management activity or facility may be allowed if the discharge enhances the wetland and/or does not increase the rate of flow, change the plant composition in a forested wetland, or decrease the water quality of the wetland; or

5.    Trails. Construction of public and private trails may not be allowed in wetland buffers unless a critical areas study per IMC 18.10.410 documents no loss of buffer functions and values. Additional buffer width equal to the width of the trail tread and the cleared trail shoulders shall be required, except where existing development prevents adding buffer width. In this case, other mitigating measures shall be required to ensure no loss of buffer functions and values.

C.    Utilities in Wetland Buffers: Sewer utility corridors may be allowed in wetland buffers only if the applicant demonstrates that sewer lines are necessary for gravity flow and no other technologically practical alternative exists, and:

1.    The corridor is not located in a wetland or buffer used by species listed as endangered or threatened by the state or federal government or containing critical or outstanding actual habitat of those species, and consider construction timing in areas with heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees;

2.    The corridor alignment including, but not limited to, any allowed maintenance roads shall not encroach into the wetland buffer at any location by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the standard wetland buffer width, per IMC 18.10.640;

3.    Corridor construction and maintenance protects the wetland and buffer and is aligned to avoid cutting trees greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter at breast height, when practical;

4.    An additional, contiguous and undisturbed buffer, equal in width to the proposed nonvegetated areas, including any allowed maintenance roads, is provided to protect the wetland;

5.    The corridor is revegetated with appropriate vegetation native to King County at preconstruction densities or greater immediately upon completion of construction or as soon thereafter as possible, and the sewer utility ensures that such vegetation is established for at least five (5) years;

6.    Any additional corridor access for maintenance is provided, to the extent possible at specific points rather than by a parallel road; and

7.    The width of any necessary parallel road providing access for maintenance is as small as possible, but not greater than fifteen (15) feet, and the location of the road is within the utility corridor on the side away from the wetland.

D.    Temporary Construction Disturbance: Except as otherwise specified, where temporary buffer disturbance has occurred during construction, revegetation with native vegetation is required. (Ord. 2783 § 5 (Exh. A5.c), 2016; Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2491 § 6, 2007; Ord. 2455 § 6, 2006; Ord. 2314 § 1, 2001; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.26.6 – 7, 1996).


18.10.615 Wetland delineations.

A.    A wetland report shall be prepared either prior to or with a development application, where a site inspection or other available information indicates the potential presence of a wetland on any portion of the subject property or within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property.

B.    A field identification or delineation of the wetland edge shall be conducted by a qualified wetland professional based on the procedures provided in the currently approved federal manual and applicable regional supplements and WAC 173-22-035.

C.    Wetland delineations and wetland ratings shall be based on the entire extent of the wetland, irrespective of property lines, ownership patterns, or other factors.

D.    The Planning Director/Manager shall approve a wetland delineation and wetland rating prior to approval of development permits. The City may require additional review of a wetland delineation and/or wetland rating by a wetland professional not associated with an applicant. Additional wetland review shall be at the applicant’s expense.

E.    A final wetland delineation report shall be valid for three (3) years. Additional time may be approved by the Planning Director/Manager if an application is proceeding through the permit process in a timely manner. The Planning Director/Manager may require an updated wetland delineation report whenever physical circumstances have markedly and demonstrably changed on the subject property or the surrounding area as a result of natural processes or human activity.

F.    After City approval of the wetland delineation and required wetland buffer, a professional survey of the wetland edge and required wetland buffer shall be shown on the permit application. The survey of the wetland delineation shall be tied to a known monument. (Ord. 2669 § 3 (Exh. A), 2013).


18.10.620 Wetland rating system.

A.    To promote consistent application of standards, wetlands within the City of Issaquah shall be classified according to their characteristics, function and value, and/or their sensitivity to disturbance. Wetlands shall be rated and regulated according to the categories defined by the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington – 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, October 2014) or as revised. This document contains the methods for determining the wetland category.

1.    Wetlands, as defined by this chapter, shall be classified into Category I, Category II, Category III, and Category IV, as follows:

a.    Category I: Category I wetlands are: (1) relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one (1) acre; (2) wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR; (3) bogs; (4) mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one (1) acre; (5) wetlands in coastal lagoons; (6) interdunal wetlands that score eight (8) or nine (9) habitat points and are larger than one (1) acre; and (7) wetlands that perform many functions well. These wetlands: (1) represent unique or rare wetland types; (2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; (3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (4) provide a high level of functions. Category I wetlands score between twenty-three (23) and twenty-seven (27) points.

b.    Category II: Category II wetlands are: (1) estuarine wetlands smaller than one (1) acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one (1) acre; (2) interdunal wetlands larger than one (1) acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands; or (3) wetlands with a moderately high level of functions. Category II wetlands score between twenty (20) and twenty-two (22) points. 

c.    Category III: Category III wetlands are: (1) wetlands with a moderate level of functions; (2) can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project; and (3) interdunal wetlands between one-tenth (0.1) and one (1) acre. Wetlands scoring between sixteen (16) and nineteen (19) points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. Category III wetlands score between sixteen (16) and nineteen (19) points.

d.    Category IV: Category IV wetlands have the lowest level of functions and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that we should be able to replace, or in some cases, to improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree. Category IV wetlands score between nine (9) and fifteen (15) points.

e.    Category IV Wetlands Less Than Two Thousand Five Hundred (2,500) Square Feet: Category IV wetlands less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in size, that are not part of a wetland complex, do not require wetland buffers and may be altered if mitigation is provided to demonstrate no net loss of functions or values, consistent with IMC 18.10.720(B)(3). (Ord. 2790 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2455 § 7, 2006; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.27 – 10.2.27.3, 1996).


18.10.630 Wetland buffers.

Repealed by Ord. 2669. (Ord. 2108 § 10.2.27.4, 1996).


18.10.640 Wetland buffer width requirements.

A.    Wetland buffers shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to wetlands.

B.    Any wetland created, restored or enhanced as mitigation or compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include the standard wetland buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

C.    All wetland buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as delineated using the approved federal manual and applicable regional supplements and surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category, as follows:

	Table 18.10.640.C Wetland Buffer Standards

	IV less than 2,500 square feet	 	No buffer required

D.    Building Setback: An additional fifteen (15) foot building setback shall also be established from the outer edge of the buffer as regulated by IMC 18.10.515(D), Building Setback Areas. (Ord. 2790 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2664 § 2 (Exh. A1), 2012; Ord. 2455 § 8, 2006; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.27.5 – 9, 1996).


18.10.650 Exceptions to wetland buffer width requirements.

A.    Existing Conditions:

1.    Previously Established Buffers: Where a wetland buffer has been previously established through City or County development approval on or after November 27, 1990, and is permanently recorded on title or placed within a separate tract, the buffer shall be as previously established, provided it is at least fifty (50) percent of the required standard wetland buffer width in Table 18.10.640.C.

2.    Roads or Infrastructure in Wetland Buffers: Where a legally established road right-of-way or similar infrastructure is located within a wetland buffer, the edge of the improved right-of-way shall be the extent of the buffer, provided it is demonstrated that the buffer area on the opposite side of the right-of-way provides insignificant biological or hydrological functions in relation to the buffer area adjacent to the wetland.

B.    Buffer Requirements for Wetlands Adjacent to Steep Slopes: Wetlands within twenty-five (25) feet of the toe of slopes equal to or greater than forty (40) percent shall have the following minimum buffers:

1.    Where the horizontal length of the slope including small benches and terraces is within the buffer for that wetland category, the buffer width shall be the greater of:

a.    The minimum for that wetland category; or

b.    Twenty-five (25) feet beyond the toe of the slope.

2.    Where the horizontal length of the slope extends beyond the minimum buffer for that wetland category, the buffer shall extend to a point twenty-five (25) feet beyond the minimum buffer for that wetland category.

3.    No reduction to wetland buffer standards in IMC 18.10.640 is allowed.

4.    The Director may recommend buffer averaging in instances where it will provide additional resource protection; provided, that the total area on site contained in the buffer remains the same.

C.    Increasing Wetland Buffer Requirements: The Director shall require increased buffer widths as necessary to protect wetlands. The additional buffer widths and other issues shall be determined by development application review on a case-by-case basis. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation demonstrating that an increased buffer is necessary to:

1.    Maintain viable populations of existing species;

2.    Protect critical fish and wildlife habitat;

3.    Protect critical drainage areas;

4.    Protect groundwater recharge or discharge areas;

5.    Protect adjacent land from landslides or severe erosion.



D.    Reducing Wetland Buffer Requirements:

1.    Wetland buffer reduction provisions in this section may be used separately or together; provided, that the cumulative, total wetland buffer reduction shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the required wetland buffer area or encroach into the buffer at any location by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the standard wetland buffer width, per IMC 18.10.640.

2.    A variance is required for wetland buffer reductions exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the required buffer area or encroachments exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the standard wetland buffer width.

3.    Wetland Buffer Reduction with Buffer Vegetation Enhancement:

a.    Purpose: The standard wetland buffer widths identified in Table 18.10.640.C may be reduced when enhancement of the existing wetland buffer vegetation would demonstratively improve water quality and habitat functions.

b.    Applicability – Qualifying Wetland Buffers: A wetland buffer may qualify for a buffer reduction under this section when:

(1)    The wetland buffer proposed to be enhanced/reduced meets all of the following characteristics:

(A)    More than forty (40) percent of the buffer area is covered by nonnative and/or invasive plant species; or

(B)    Tree and/or shrub vegetation cover less than twenty-five (25) percent of the buffer area; and

(C)    The wetland buffer has slopes of less than twenty-five (25) percent.

(2)    The proposed development incorporates performance standards to minimize the impacts of the proposed land use, consistent with IMC 18.10.660.

c.    Critical Area Study Required: A critical area study consistent with the requirements of IMC 18.10.410(C) and the following provisions is required in order to evaluate and approve a reduction of the standard buffer width. The critical area study shall:

(1)    Evaluate the water quality, habitat, groundwater recharge, stormwater detention, and erosion protection functions of the wetland buffer;

(2)    Document whether or not the:

(A)    Wetland buffer under consideration meets the criteria established in subsection (D)(3)(b) of this section and qualifies for consideration of a buffer reduction under this section;

(B)    Buffer reduction would adversely affect the functions and values of the adjacent wetland; and

(C)    Ecological structure and function of the reduced buffer after planting enhancement would improve water quality and habitat functions.

(3)    Propose a wetland buffer enhancement plan including:

(A)    Removal of all invasive, nonnative vegetation; and

(B)    Planting of appropriate native tree and shrub species at a minimum planting density of ten (10) feet on center for trees and five (5) feet on center for shrubs; and

(C)    A monitoring and maintenance plan for the enhanced buffer for a five (5) year period, consistent with IMC 18.10.760 and 18.10.810.

d.    Allowed Buffer Reduction: Following are the wetland buffer reductions allowed when all of the criteria in subsections B and C of this section are met:

	Wetland Category	Maximum Buffer Reduction at Any Location

	Category I and II wetlands	25 percent of the standard buffer width

	Category III wetlands with habitat scores of 26 points or more	25 percent of the standard buffer width

	Category III with habitat scores less than 26 points and Category IV wetlands	15 percent of the standard buffer width

4.    Wetland Buffer Reduction with Removal of Impervious Surface Area: The standard wetland buffer area may be reduced at a 1:1 ratio with the removal of existing, legally nonconforming impervious surface area located within the wetland buffer area. For example, if one hundred (100) square feet of existing impervious area are removed, the wetland buffer area may be reduced by one hundred (100) square feet. The removed impervious area shall be located closer toward the wetland than the proposed buffer reduction area. The removed impervious area shall be restored with native vegetation, consistent with the wetland buffer enhancement plan requirements in subsection (D)(3)(c)(3) of this section. Existing site characteristics, including buffer vegetation, slopes, etc., and the proposed development shall be considered in determining the location of the allowed reduced buffer area.

5.    Wetland Buffer Averaging Requirements: Standard wetland buffer widths may be modified by averaging buffer widths after review of a critical area study prepared by a qualified wetland professional for compliance with the following criteria:

a.    The proposed site plan demonstrates efforts to avoid and minimize wetland and wetland buffer impacts;

18.10.700 Avoiding wetland impacts.

A.    To further the goal of no net loss of wetland functions or values, regulated activities shall not be authorized in a wetland except as provided in this section or where it can be demonstrated that the impact is both unavoidable and necessary and/or that all reasonable uses are denied through the variance provision established in IMC 18.10.430.

B.    With respect to Category I and II wetlands, an applicant must demonstrate through the variance provision, as established in IMC 18.10.430, that denial of the proposal would preclude all reasonable use of the subject property on the part of the applicant brought about by circumstances peculiar to the subject property.

C.    With respect to Category III and IV wetlands, the following provisions shall apply:

1.    For water-dependent activities, unavoidable and necessary impacts can be authorized by the Director where it is demonstrated that there are no practicable alternatives that would not involve a wetland or which would not have less adverse impact on a wetland, and would not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.

2.    Where non-water-dependent activities are proposed, it shall be presumed that adverse impacts are avoidable. This presumption may be rebutted upon a demonstration to the Director that:

a.    The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished using one (1) or more other sites in the general region (outside the hydraulic influence area) that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on a regulated wetland;

b.    The basic purpose of the project cannot be accomplished by reducing the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project, as proposed, and by using any alternative designs of the project, as proposed, that would avoid, or result in less adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer;

c.    In cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the project, as proposed, due to constraints such as zoning, deficiencies of infrastructure, or parcel size, the applicant has made reasonable attempt to remove or accommodate such constraints.

D.    If an applicant for a development proposal which has Category III or IV wetlands can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that application of the standards provided in this chapter will deny all reasonable use of the property, development as conditioned shall be allowed if the applicant also demonstrates all of the following to the satisfaction of the Director. The Director has the option to forward the decision to a Hearing Examiner through the variance provision outlined in IMC 18.10.430.

1.    That the proposed project is water-dependent or requires access to the wetland as a central element of its basic function, or is not water-dependent but has no practicable alternative pursuant to this section;

2.    That no reasonable use with less impact on the wetland and its buffer is possible (e.g., agriculture, aquaculture, transfer or sale of development rights or credits, sale of open space easements, etc.);

3.    That there is no feasible on-site alternative to the proposed activities, including reduction in density, phasing of project implementation, change in timing of activities, revision of road and lot layout, and/or related site planning considerations, that would allow a reasonable use with less adverse impacts to wetlands and wetland buffers;

4.    That the proposed activities will result in minimum feasible alteration or impairment to the wetland’s functional characteristics and its existing contours, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, and hydrological conditions;

5.    That disturbance of wetlands has been minimized by locating any necessary alteration in wetland buffers to the extent possible;

6.    That the proposed activities will not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered, threatened, rare, sensitive, or monitor species as listed by the federal government or the state of Washington;

7.    That the proposed activities will not cause significant degradation of groundwater or surface water quality;

8.    That the proposed activities comply with all state, local and federal laws, including those related to sediment control, pollution control, floodplain restrictions, and on-site wastewater disposal;

9.    That any and all alterations to wetlands and wetland buffers will be mitigated as provided in IMC 18.10.750;

10.    That there will be no damage to nearby public or private property and no threat to the health or safety of people on or off the property; and

11.    That the inability to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant in segregating or dividing the property and creating the undevelopable condition after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.27.16 – 19, 1996).


18.10.710 Minimizing wetlands impacts.

A.    After it has been determined by either the Hearing Examiner or the Director pursuant to IMC 18.10.700 (Avoiding Wetland Impacts) that losses of wetlands are necessary and unavoidable or that all reasonable use has been denied, the applicant shall take deliberate measures to minimize wetland impacts.

B.    Minimizing impacts to wetlands shall include but is not limited to:

1.    Limiting the degree or magnitude of the regulated activity;

2.    Limiting the implementation of the regulated activity;

3.    Using appropriate and best available technology;

4.    Taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

5.    Sensitive site design and siting of facilities and construction staging areas away from regulated wetlands and their buffers;

6.    Involving resource agencies early in site planning; 

7.    Providing protective measures such as siltation curtains, hay bales and other siltation prevention measures, scheduling the regulated activity to avoid interference with wildlife and fisheries rearing, resting, nesting or spawning activities; 

8.    Prohibiting the intentional introduction of nonnative vegetation, except in conjunction with approved restoration projects; and

9.    Providing preventative measures for soil erosion such as inspections and a monitoring plan. (Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.27.20 – 21, 1996).


18.10.720 Mitigating for wetland impacts.

A.    Goal: All approved impacts to regulated wetlands require compensatory mitigation so that the goal of no net loss of wetland function, value and acreage is achieved. Mitigation actions shall provide equivalent or greater wetland and buffer functions compared to wetland and buffer conditions existing prior to the proposed alteration.

B.    Wetland Mitigation Ratios:

1.    The following ratios apply to mitigation which is in kind, on site, the same wetland category, timed prior to or concurrent with alteration, and has a high probability of success. The first number specifies the acreage of required wetlands to be created, re-established, rehabilitated or enhanced and the second number specifies the acreage of existing wetlands proposed for alteration.

2.    Minimum Replacement Ratio: In order to maintain no net loss of wetland acreage, in all cases the wetland creation or re-establishment ratio shall be a minimum of 1:1.

	Category and Type of Wetland Impacts	Creation or Re-establishment	Rehabilitation Only	Creation or Re-establishment (R/C) and Rehabilitation (RH)	Creation or Re-establishment (R/C) and Enhancement (E)

	Category IV Greater than 2,500 SF in size	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 R/C and 1:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E

	All Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 4:1 E

	Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 R/C and 4:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 8:1 E

	Category I Forested	6:1	12:1	1:1 R/C and 10:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 20:1 E

	Category I – based on score for functions	4:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 6:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 12:1 E

	Category I Natural Heritage site	Not allowed	6:1  Rehabilitation of a Natural Heritage site	Not allowed	Not allowed

	Category I Bog	Not allowed	6:1  Rehabilitation of a bog	Not allowed	Not allowed

3.    Category IV Wetlands Less Than Two Thousand Five Hundred (2,500) Square Feet: Category IV wetlands less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in size, that are not part of a wetland complex, may be altered if mitigation is provided to demonstrate no net loss of functions or values. No buffer is required for these wetlands. The following criteria shall apply in preferential order to avoid or mitigate impacts to Category IV wetlands less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet in size:

a.    Preserve the wetland or demonstrate through mitigation sequencing that avoidance or minimization of impacts have been considered; or

b.    Relocate the wetland on site by creating, re-establishing or rehabilitating a new, equal size wetland; or

c.    Enhance an equal area of another existing wetland on site, demonstrating equivalent or greater functions; or

d.    Protect significant on-site trees. Protect an area of significant trees equal to the wetland area or enhance an equal upland area with native tree planting. This shall not apply to areas already protected as critical area buffers and shall be in addition to the tree retention requirements in IMC 18.12.1385; or

e.    Off-site mitigation opportunities may be considered.

4.    Increased Mitigation Ratio: The Director may increase the ratios under the following circumstances:

a.    Uncertainty as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation;

b.    Significant period of time between destruction and replication of wetland functions;

c.    Projected losses in functional value; or

d.    Off-site compensation.

e.    Mitigation ratios may be increased for remedial actions along with other penalties resulting from illegal, unpermitted wetland alterations.

5.    Decreased Mitigation Ratio:

a.    The Director may decrease the replacement ratios specified in this section; provided, that findings of critical areas studies coordinated with the participation of agencies having expertise demonstrates that no net loss of wetlands function or value is attained under the decreased ratio.

C.    Wetland Buffer Requirements for Mitigation Wetlands: Wetland buffer impacts are assumed when wetland fill or modification is proposed. A new wetland buffer shall be established around the wetland mitigation area equal in width to the standard wetland buffer width specified in IMC 18.10.640.

D.    Criteria for Approval: Given the uncertainties in scientific knowledge and the need for expertise and monitoring, wetland compensatory projects may be permitted only when the Director finds that the compensation project is associated with an activity or development proposal directly associated with an approved Hearing Examiner’s and/or Director’s decision (as set forth in IMC 18.10.700) or an approved variance (IMC 18.10.430), and that the restored, created, or enhanced wetland will be as persistent as the wetland it replaces. A maintenance bond will be required pursuant to IMC 18.10.810.

E.    Type of Compensation Project: Compensation areas shall be determined according to function, acreage, type, location, time factors, ability to be self sustaining and projected success. Wetland functions and values shall be calculated using the best professional judgment of a qualified wetland professional using the best available techniques. Multiple compensation projects may be proposed for one (1) project in order to best achieve the goal of no net loss.

F.    In-Kind Compensation:

1.    In-kind compensation shall be provided except where the applicant can demonstrate that:

a.    Scientific problems such as exotic vegetation and changes in watershed hydrology make implementation of in-kind compensation impossible; or

b.    Out-of-kind replacement will best meet identified regional goals (e.g., replacement of historically diminished wetland types)

G.    Timing:

1.    Where feasible, mitigation projects shall be completed prior to activities that will disturb wetlands. In all other cases, mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development.

2.    Construction of compensation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing wildlife and flora.

H.    Location:

1.    On-site compensation shall be provided except where the applicant can demonstrate that:

a.    The hydrology and ecosystem of the original wetland and those who benefit from the hydrology and ecosystem will not be substantially damaged by the on-site loss; and

b.    On-site compensation is not scientifically feasible due to problems with hydrology, soils, waves, or other factors; or

c.    Compensation is not practical due to potentially adverse impact from surrounding land uses; or

d.    Existing functional values at the site of the proposed restoration are significantly greater than lost wetland functional values; or

e.    Established regional goals for flood storage, flood conveyance, habitat or other wetland functions have been established and strongly justify location of compensatory measures at another site.

2.    Off-site compensation shall occur within the same watershed as the wetland loss occurred.

3.    In selecting compensation sites, applicants shall pursue siting in areas conducive to wetland creation, enhancement, or restoration based on recommendations of a wetland biologist and approved by the City.

I.    Wetland Mitigation Banking: The City may consider and approve replacement or enhancement of unavoidable adverse impacts to wetlands caused by development activities through an approved wetland mitigation bank, in advance of authorized impacts. Criteria governing the creation and use of a mitigation bank shall be established in administrative rules.

J.    Cooperative Projects:

1.    The Director may encourage, facilitate, and approve cooperative projects wherein a single applicant or other organization with demonstrated capability may undertake a compensation project with funding and/or support from other applicants under the following circumstances:

a.    Restoration, creation or enhancement at a particular site may be scientifically difficult or impossible; or

Development activity on sites containing streams or stream buffers shall meet the requirements of this chapter. Streams and associated buffers shall not be altered (see definition of “alteration,” IMC 18.10.390) except as expressly authorized by this chapter. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of all other agencies with jurisdiction have been met. In addition, the following general protections apply to streams and associated buffers:

A.    Development proposals on sites containing streams shall meet the requirements of IMC 18.10.770 through 18.10.795. Streams and associated buffers shall not be altered except as expressly authorized by this chapter and all approved alterations require mitigation plans. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of all other agencies with jurisdiction have been met.

B.    The applicant must notify affected communities and native tribes of alteration plans prior to any alteration of a stream, submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, and any alterations must be consistent with IMC 18.10.520 through 18.10.530.

C.    There shall be no introduction of any vegetation or wildlife which is not indigenous to the Pacific Northwest into any stream critical area or associated buffers unless authorized by the state of Washington or a federal license or permit.

No structures shall be permitted within streams or stream buffers except as outlined in the following subsections:

A.    Stream Crossings: Stream crossings may be allowed only if they meet the requirements as follows:

1.    All road and utility crossings shall use bridges or other construction techniques which do not disturb the stream bed or bank; however, in the case of Class 2, 3 or 4 streams, appropriate methods demonstrated to provide fisheries protection may be used if the applicant demonstrates that such methods and their implementation will pose no harm to the stream and will not inhibit migration of fish and will accommodate one hundred (100) year flood flows as established by the City. This shall be accomplished through bridge crossing design and/or appropriate flood control facilities constructed as part of the project design. Any structure spanning a stream shall be designed so the supporting foundation is outside the ordinary high water mark;

2.    All crossings shall be constructed during summer low flow and be timed to avoid stream disturbance during periods when use is critical to salmonids;

3.    Crossings shall not occur over salmonid spawning areas unless no other possible crossing site exists on the subject property;

4.    Crossings shall not diminish the flood carrying capacity of the stream;

5.    Underground utility crossings shall be located at a preferred depth of four (4) feet below the maximum depth of scour for the base flood predicted by a Washington State licensed civil engineer and be constructed in a manner approved by the Washington State Department of Fisheries; and

6.    Crossings shall be minimized and serve multiple purposes and properties whenever possible.

B.    Relocations: The following relocations may be allowed if they meet all requirements and are approved by all agencies with jurisdiction. 

1.    Class 1 streams shall not be relocated, except for approved restoration projects.

2.    Class 2 streams shall not be relocated except for approved restoration projects and public road projects which have been authorized by the exemption process set out in IMC 18.10.400.

3.    Class 3 and 4 streams may be relocated under a mitigation plan for the purpose of enhancement of in-stream resources. Appropriate floodplain protection measures must be used. The relocation shall occur on site; provided, that upon demonstration that on-site relocation is impracticable, the City may consider off-site relocation if the location is in the same drainage sub-basin and the applicant obtains all necessary easements and waivers from affected property owners.

4.    Prior to any stream relocation, an applicant must demonstrate that the proposed project meets the following criteria, based on information provided by a licensed geotechnical engineer and a biologist. All work performed must also be carried out under the supervision of a licensed geotechnical engineer and a biologist. The criteria include the following:

f.    Performance standards as set out in the mitigation plan are met;

g.    The relocation conforms to other applicable laws.

C.    Trails: Construction of public and private trails is not allowed in stream buffers unless a critical areas study per IMC 18.10.410, Critical areas studies, documents no loss of buffer functions and values. The buffer area used for the trail tread and cleared trail shoulders shall be replaced by adding an equal area to the buffer. Where existing development prevents adding the replacement buffer, other mitigation measures shall be required to ensure no loss of buffer functions and values. Other mitigating measures may include off-site mitigation along the same stream as the trail. The critical areas study shall evaluate and recommend the best location(s) for the replacement buffer and any off-site mitigation.

D.    Stream Channel Stabilization: Stream channels may be stabilized when movement of the stream channel threatens existing residential or commercial structures, public improvements, unique natural resources, or the only existing access to property, and when stabilization is done in accordance with the requirements in IMC 18.10.530 and the administrative rules.

E.    Surface Water Management: The following surface water management actions may be allowed (through the appropriate review and approval process, or Level 1 review if none is specified) only if they meet the following requirements:

1.    Surface water discharges to streams from stormwater facilities or other surface water management structures having no feasible alternative on-site locations may be allowed so long as the discharge complies with the provisions of the City’s currently adopted Stormwater Design Manual.

2.    Flood conveyance compensatory storage, where there is no other feasible alternative, where appropriate restoration is included, and where wetland hydrology will not be significantly affected.

3.    Stream buffers may be used for stormwater facilities when:

a.    Authorized by the exemption process set out in IMC 18.10.400; and

b.    All requirements of the City’s currently adopted Stormwater Design Manual are met; and

c.    There are no significant adverse impacts to the stream or its resources; and

d.    The stormwater facilities shall not encroach into stream buffers by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the standard stream buffer width, per IMC 18.10.785, or use more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total buffer area without a variance; and

e.    Any stream buffer area displaced by a stormwater facility shall be compensated for by adding an equal stream buffer area in accordance with stream buffer averaging, IMC 18.10.790(D)(6), so that no net loss of stream buffer area results from the construction of the facility. Stormwater vaults located in stream buffers shall have adequate soil cover to support native vegetation including small trees, shrubs and groundcover; and

f.    Stormwater facilities such as bioretention, rain gardens, or constructed wetlands planted with appropriate native vegetation and trees are allowed without buffer averaging requirements.

4.    Streams and buffers may be altered to remove exotic or invasive vegetation, and for restoration of floodplains and habitat, so long as the project will have no lasting adverse impacts that result from construction on any stream and all requirements of the City’s currently adopted Stormwater Design Manual and all other applicable codes are met.

F.    Utilities in Stream Buffers:

1.    Utility Construction: Construction of utilities shall be permitted in the outermost twenty-five (25) percent of a stream buffer only when it has been determined through Level 1 Review or through the appropriate land use permitting process that:

a.    No practical alternative location is available; and

b.    The utility corridor meets the criteria set forth in the applicable City ordinance including, but not limited to, requirements for installation, replacement of vegetation, and maintenance; and

c.    Impacts to the buffer area are minimized and restoration is implemented to the greatest extent feasible; and

d.    The requirements for sewer utility corridors in IMC 18.10.610(C) shall also apply to stream buffers.

G.    Enhancement Independent of Development Proposals:

1.    Enhancement of streams, not associated with any other development proposal, may be allowed when the City, or any state agency with jurisdiction, determines that such enhancement benefits stream functions. Such enhancement shall be performed under a plan for the design, implementation, maintenance and monitoring of the project prepared by a civil engineer and a biologist and shall be carried out under the direct supervision of a biologist.

2.    Stream restoration projects for fish habitat enhancement by a public agency unassociated with mitigation of a specific development proposal may be allowed. Such projects are limited to placement of log controls, spawning gravel, and other specific salmonid habitat improvements to be performed under direct supervision of a biologist, within the approved Washington State Department of Fisheries window, if applicable.

3.    Removal of exotic or invasive plants within streams and buffers is allowed. A City-approved mitigation plan is required before removal of vegetation commences.

H.    Drainage Ditch Maintenance: Drainage ditches must be maintained through use of best management practices developed in consultation with City, state and federal agencies with expertise or jurisdiction.

I.    Revegetation shall include only native plant species, except in conjunction with approved restoration projects.

J.    Where construction activities occur adjacent to a stream buffer, an erosion control specialist, provided by the applicant, shall visit the site at least once a day during construction, and report daily to the City’s inspector, for the purpose of monitoring potential erosion problems and specifying erosion control measures necessary to protect the critical area. (Ord. 2783 § 5 (Exh. A5.d), 2016; Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2525 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2455 § 13, 2006).

The buffer area established using the OHWM identified at the time the channel improvements are constructed shall be surveyed and recorded as a covenant running with the land. Buildings on these parcels of land shall adhere to the fifteen (15) foot building setback to the stream buffer. The establishment of the OHWM under this exception does not establish the OHWM used for building setbacks under the City’s Shoreline Master Program. (Note: Both OHWM standards, Critical Areas – Stream buffer and the Shoreline Master Program, shall be used in determining the appropriate building setback lines for development of these properties.) 

C.    Stream Buffer Width Standards: The following buffers on each side of the ordinary high water mark are minimum requirements: 

1.    Class 1 streams – one hundred (100) foot buffer. 

2.    Class 2 streams used by salmonids – one hundred (100) foot buffer. 

3.    Class 2 streams – seventy-five (75) foot buffer. 

4.    Class 3 streams – fifty (50) foot buffer.

5.    Class 4 streams – twenty-five (25) foot buffer. 

D.    Changes to existing legal nonconforming situations shall comply with Nonconforming Situations, IMC 18.08.050(I).

E.    Any stream restored, relocated, replaced or enhanced because of alterations should have at least the minimum buffer required for the class of stream involved. 

F.    Building Setback: An additional fifteen (15) foot building setback shall also be established from the outer edge of the buffer as regulated by IMC 18.10.515(D), Building Setback Areas. (Ord. 2664 § 2 (Exh. A1), 2012; Ord. 2455 § 15, 2006).


18.10.790 Exceptions to stream buffer width requirements.

A.    Buffer Requirements for Streams Adjacent to Steep Slopes: When the ordinary high water mark of any stream is within twenty-five (25) feet of the toe of slopes equal to or greater than forty (40) percent the following minimum buffers shall be provided:

1.    Where the horizontal length of the slope including small benches and terraces is within the buffer for that stream class, the buffer shall be the greater of:

a.    The minimum buffer for that stream class; or

b.    Twenty-five (25) feet beyond the top of the slope.

2.    Where the horizontal length of the slope extends beyond the minimum buffer for that stream class, the buffer shall extend to a point twenty-five (25) feet beyond the minimum buffer for that stream class.

3.    No reduction to stream buffer standards in IMC 18.10.785(C) is allowed.

B.    Buffer Requirements for Streams Adjacent to Other Critical Areas: Any stream adjoined by riparian wetland or other adjacent critical area shall have the buffer which applies to the wetland or other adjacent critical area, unless the stream buffer requirements are more expansive.

C.    Increasing Stream Buffer Requirements: Issaquah shall require increased buffer widths as necessary to protect streams. The additional buffer widths and other issues shall be determined during project review and will be based on the results of a critical area study with consideration of and including, but not limited to:

1.    Critical drainage areas;

2.    Location of hazardous materials;

3.    Critical fish and wildlife habitat;

4.    Landslide or erosion hazard areas;

5.    Groundwater recharge and discharge; and

6.    The location of trail or utility corridors.

D.    Reducing Stream Buffer Requirements:

1.    Stream buffer reduction provisions in this section may be used separately or together; provided, that the cumulative, total stream buffer reduction shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the required stream buffer area or encroach into the buffer at any location by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the standard stream buffer width, per IMC 18.10.785(C).

2.    A variance is required for stream buffer reductions exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the required buffer area or encroachments exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the standard stream buffer width.

3.    Stream Buffer Reduction for Class 1 and Class 2 Streams with Salmonids: Prior to the City’s approval of a stream buffer reduction, an applicant shall first demonstrate the proposed site plan avoids and minimizes the amount of buffer reduction, consistent with IMC 18.10.490.

4.    Stream Buffer Reduction with Buffer Vegetation Enhancement:

a.    Purpose: The standard stream buffer widths identified in IMC 18.10.785(C) may be reduced when enhancement of the existing stream buffer vegetation would demonstratively improve water quality and habitat functions.

b.    Applicability – Qualifying Stream Buffers: A stream buffer may qualify for a buffer reduction under this section when:

(1)    The stream buffer proposed to be enhanced/reduced meets all of the following characteristics:

d.    Allowed Buffer Reduction: Following are the stream buffer reductions allowed when all of the criteria in subsections B, C and D of this section are met:

	Stream Class	Maximum Buffer Reduction at Any Location

	Class 2, 3, and 4 streams	25 percent of the standard buffer width

	Class 2(S) and Class 1 streams	25 percent of the standard buffer width  (see subsection (D)(3) of this section)

5.    Stream Buffer Reduction with Removal of Impervious Surface Area: The standard stream buffer area may be reduced at a 1:1 ratio with the removal of existing, legally nonconforming impervious surface area located within the stream buffer area. For example, if one hundred (100) square feet of existing impervious area are removed, the stream buffer may be reduced by one hundred (100) square feet. The removed impervious area shall be located closer toward the stream than the proposed buffer reduction area. The removed impervious area shall be restored with native vegetation, consistent with the stream buffer enhancement plan requirements in subsection (D)(4)(c)(3) of this section. Existing site characteristics, including buffer vegetation, slopes, etc., and proposed development shall be considered in determining the location of the allowed reduced buffer area.

6.    Stream Buffer Averaging Requirements: Standard stream buffer widths may be modified by averaging buffer widths after review of a critical area study prepared by a qualified professional for compliance with the following criteria:

a.    The proposed site plan demonstrates efforts to avoid and minimize stream and stream buffer impacts;

b.    Buffer width averaging is consistent with the best available science and will not adversely impact functions or values;

c.    The total area within the stream buffer after averaging is no less than the area within the standard buffer prior to averaging. The location of the replacement buffer area shall be contiguous with the standard buffer to be averaged;

d.    The buffer width shall not be reduced by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the standard buffer width at any location, unless a variance is approved in accordance with IMC 18.10.430;

e.    A maximum of fifty (50) percent of the buffer perimeter on a site may be reduced by averaging;

f.    Buffer averaging shall consider physical characteristics on a site, including but not limited to existing buffer vegetation, slopes, floodplain, hydrology, surface drainage, and association with nearby streams and wetlands. Buffer averaging shall not be allowed within the designated floodway of streams;

g.    Buffer averaging credit shall not be allowed in areas already protected by the critical area regulations; and

h.    Mitigation, such as revegetation and enhancement of existing vegetation, may be required by the Director. (Ord. 2669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2455 § 16, 2006; Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.30, 1996).


18.10.795 Mitigation for streams.

A.    Mitigation shall be conducted as defined in IMC 18.10.390, as provided in IMC 18.10.490, and in this section.

B.    Standards for Restoration, Enhancement or Replacement:

1.    Restoration is required when a stream or its buffer has been altered in violation of this chapter or any other ordinance applying to the treatment of streams, or when an unapproved or unanticipated alteration occurs during the construction of an approved development proposal; provided, that a mitigation plan for the restoration demonstrates that:

a.    The stream is degraded and will not be further degraded by the restoration activity;



b.    The restoration will reliably and demonstrably improve the water quality and fisheries and wildlife habitat of the stream;

c.    The restoration will have no lasting significant adverse impacts on any in-stream resource; and

d.    All work will be carried out under the direct supervision of a biologist.

e.    The following minimum performance standards shall be met for restoration of a stream; provided, that these standards may be modified if the applicant can demonstrate that greater habitat value can be obtained:

(1)    The natural or channel dimensions existing immediately prior to the development proposal (unless illegally altered), including identical depth, width, length and gradient at the location and the horizontal alignment (meander lengths) should be replaced to replicate the conditions immediately prior to the development proposal (unless illegally altered);

(2)    The bottom should be restored with identical or similar materials;

(3)    The bank and buffer configuration should be restored to the natural conditions;

(4)    The channel, bank and buffer areas should be replanted with native vegetation which replicates the optimal in species, sizes and densities; and

(5)    The natural habitat value should be restored.

2.    Replacement or enhancement is required when the City permits or approves the alteration of a stream or buffer. There will be no net loss of stream functions on a development proposal site and no impact on stream functions above or below the site due to approved alterations.

a.    Replacement: When an approved alteration involves the relocation of a stream, the performance standards in subsection (B)(1)(e) of this section are required in order to replicate the structure and function of the original stream, unless the applicant can demonstrate that greater habitat value can be obtained through varying these standards.

b.    Enhancement: Enhancement, when allowed, should improve the functions and values of the streams. Surface water management or flood control alterations shall not be considered enhancement unless other functions and values are simultaneously increased.

c.    On-Site: Replacement or enhancement for streams shall be accomplished in streams, and shall occur on-site unless the applicant demonstrates that: on-site replacement or enhancement is not possible; the off-site alternative is in the same drainage sub-basin; and greater biological and hydrological values will be derived.

3.    Monitoring Program: Stream and stream buffer monitoring shall be required in accordance with IMC 18.10.500.

4.    Maintenance Program: All streams and stream buffers adjacent to proposed development shall be maintained in perpetuity based on direction from the Director with input from City staff. (Ord. 2301 § 3, 2001; Ord. 2108 § 10.2.31, 1996. Formerly 18.10.800).


18.10.796 Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs).

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of this section is to establish critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs) and groundwater protection standards to protect the Issaquah Creek Valley aquifer from degradation and depletion. The intent is to minimize loss of recharge quantity, to maintain the protection of supply wells for public drinking water, and to prevent contamination of groundwater.

B.    Applicability:

1.    The provisions of this section shall apply to regulated activities occurring within Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 CARAs as identified in subsection (C) of this section, Classification, and on the City of Issaquah Critical Aquifer Recharge Area Classification Map, as may be updated as new information becomes available, on file with the Planning Department and incorporated into this section by reference.

2.    A hydrogeologic critical area assessment report shall be submitted to add or remove areas to the CARA classification map. The City will determine if site characteristics meet the mapping criteria for a CARA designation.

C.    Classification: CARAs shall be classified based on the following criteria:

1.    Class 1 CARAs include those mapped areas located within the one (1) or five (5) year capture zone of a wellhead protection area.

2.    Class 2 CARAs include those mapped areas located within the ten (10) year capture zone of a wellhead protection area.

3.    Class 3 CARAs include those mapped areas outside wellhead protection areas that are identified as high aquifer recharge potential areas based on characteristics of surficial geology and soil types.

D.    Implementation: Best management practices governing groundwater quality standards for CARA are found in Chapter 13.29 IMC, Groundwater Quality Protection Standards. Groundwater quantity standards and requirements for infiltration are found in Chapter 13.28 IMC, Stormwater Management Policy.

E.    Groundwater Reports: In order to protect groundwater quality, the City may require a groundwater monitoring plan and/or a hydrogeologic critical area assessment report for new development projects.

F.    Prohibited and Restricted Uses: The Table of Permitted Land Uses (IMC 18.06.130) establishes the land uses and related activities that are prohibited in Class 1, 2 and 3 CARAs. Existing uses that have a long-term potential to degrade water quality in the WHPA shall discontinue, remove or mitigate potential impacts.

G.    State and Federal Regulations: Applicants shall be required to provide documentation of compliance with state and/or federal standards and regulations. Nothing in this section shall relieve an applicant from the requirements of any other federal, state, or local law or regulation. (Ord. 2525 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2500 § 7, 2007).

18.10.810 Bonds for restoration and mitigation activities.

A.    Performance Bonds: Mitigation required pursuant to a development proposal must be completed prior to the City’s granting of final approval of the development proposal. If the applicant demonstrates that seasonal requirements or other circumstances beyond its control prevent completion of the mitigation prior to final approval, the applicant may post a performance bond equal to one hundred fifty (150) percent of the total cost of the mitigation project to complete, or other security instrument which guarantees that all required mitigation measures will be completed no later than the time established by the City in accordance with this chapter.

B.    Maintenance/Monitoring Bonds: The City shall require the applicant whose development proposal is subject to a mitigation plan to post a maintenance/monitoring bond equal to fifty (50) percent of the estimated maintenance and monitoring cost, or other security instrument in an amount determined sufficient to guarantee satisfactory workmanship, materials, and performance of structures and improvements allowed or required by this chapter for a period of five (5) years.

C.    Performance and maintenance/monitoring bonds or other security instruments shall also be required for restoration of a critical area not performed as part of a mitigation plan, except no bond shall be required for minor stream restoration carried out pursuant to this chapter.

D.    Bonds or other security instruments shall be in a form and amount approved by the Director and the City Attorney and shall remain in effect until the Director determines in writing that performance and maintenance standards have been met.

E.    Enforcement of Bonds: Depletion, failure, or collection of bond funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation or restoration. (Ord. 2108 § 10.2.32, 1996).


18.10.820 Enforcement and penalties for critical areas.

A.    The enforcement provisions for critical areas are intended to encourage compliance and protect critical areas and the public from harm. To achieve these ends, violators will not only be required to restore damaged critical areas, insofar as that is possible, but will also be required to pay a civil penalty for the redress of ecological, recreational, and economic values lost or damaged due to their unlawful action.

A.    Recourse to any single remedy shall not preclude recourse to any of the other remedies.

B.    The Director may serve upon a person a cease and desist order if an activity being undertaken on a critical area or its buffer is in violation of this Code or related Director’s decision. Whenever any person violates this Code or any permit issued to implement this Code, the Director may issue an order reasonably appropriate to cease such violation and to mitigate any environmental damage resulting therefrom.

1.    The order shall set forth and contain:

a.    A description of the specific nature, extent, and time of violation and the damage or potential damage; and

b.    A notice that the violation or the potential violation cease and desist or, in appropriate cases, the specific corrective action to be taken within a given time. A civil penalty may be issued with the order.

2.    The cease and desist order issued under this section shall become effective immediately upon receipt by the person to whom the order is directed.

3.    Failure to comply with the terms of a cease and desist order can result in enforcement actions including, but not limited to, the issuance of a civil penalty.

4.    Orders and penalties issued pursuant to this subsection may be appealed as provided for in IMC 18.10.880.

C.    Any person who undertakes any activity within a critical area or its buffer without first obtaining a permit required by this Code, except as allowed in each section under the allowed activities provision, or any person who violates one (1) or more conditions of any permit required by this Code or of any order issued pursuant to subsection (C)(2) of this section, shall incur a penalty allowed per violation.

1.    In the case of a continuing violation, each permit violation and each day of activity without a required permit shall be a separate and distinct violation.

2.    The penalty amount shall be set in consideration of the previous history of the violator and the severity of the environmental impact of the violation.

3.    Penalties provided from this section shall be appealable to King County Superior Court. (Ord. 2108 §§ 10.2.33.10 – 12, 1996).


18.10.850 Revocation or refusal to accept application.

Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)


18.10.2005 Purpose and intent of the transfer of development rights program.

The intent of the TDR program is to transfer density from eligible sending sites to eligible receiving sites through a voluntary process that will:

A.    Decrease development pressure on critical areas by providing property owners with the opportunity for a reasonable economic return by transferring development rights from parcels with these critical areas to land more suited for urban development. Key focus areas are salmon habitat, riparian corridors, and floodways throughout the Tibbetts Creek and Issaquah Creek Basins.

B.    Increase the opportunities for providing parks.

C.    Promote design and development consistent with the City’s vision as established in the Comprehensive Plan; Urban Villages; and the Central Issaquah Plan.

D.    Allow the transfer of development rights:

1.    Between parties, through direct sale of development rights from a qualified sending site property owner to a qualified receiving site property owner; and

2.    Between the City and a sending or receiving site property owner where the City may act as a TDR bank for development rights by purchasing TDRs from qualified sending sites and/or by pre-selling them to an applicant for use on a qualified receiving site; and

3.    Between King County’s TDR bank and a City receiving site, as authorized through an interlocal TDR Agreement. (Ord. 2911 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 2684 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013).


18.10.2010 State enabling legislation.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.090, Comprehensive plans – Innovative techniques, which states, “A comprehensive plan should provide for innovative land use management techniques, including, but not limited to, density bonuses, cluster housing, planned unit developments, and the transfer of development rights.” (Ord. 2684 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013).


18.10.2020 Definitions.

Following are specific definitions for certain words, terms and phrases used in this section of the Issaquah Land Use Code. Where any of these definitions conflict with definitions used in other titles of the Municipal Code, the definitions herein shall prevail when used in the context of this chapter. Other terms used in this section may be defined in Chapter 18.02 IMC.

Bank: See “TDR bank.”

CIP: Central Issaquah Plan.

Creek side restoration: A project approved by the City for the restoration of creek side areas for the benefit of anadromous fish habitat.

Designated Official: The designee of the Administration empowered by the Mayor to administer this chapter.

Designated property: Those parcels shown as TDR sending or receiving sites on the TDR Sending and Receiving Sites Map. The sending site development rights are required to become certified by the City before TDRs may be sold or transferred. (See IMC 18.10.2040(B), TDR Certification.)

Easement, conservation: A voluntary, publicly recorded restriction, in a form approved by the Designated Official, in order to protect resources such as agricultural lands, historic structures, open space and wildlife habitat. The easement may include all or part of a parcel. In perpetuity, no new development shall take place within the areas covered by the easement. However, the construction and maintenance of a soft-surface, natural trail could be allowed, if part of a City-approved plan.

Equivalent residential units (ERUs): One ERU is equal to either one residential unit (single family or multifamily), or 1,200 square feet of nonresidential entitlement.

Exchange Rate: A transfer ratio or multiplier, determined by the Designated Official or King County’s TDR Official, as appropriate, to correct for the market imbalance in value between development rights in sending and receiving sites.

Extinguishment document, quit claim deed: When a development right is purchased and then used, the right to build a dwelling unit on the sending site is “extinguished.” It is used up and cannot be used again in any other location. The quit claim deed and extinguishment document records the sale and use of the development right on both the sending site and the receiving site and states how the development rights are applied.

King County TDR bank: An entity authorized by King County to:

1.    Facilitate the private TDR market by bridging the time gap between willing sellers and buyers of TDRs;

2.    Act as a revolving fund for continued land protection through buying, holding, and selling TDRs (proceeds from TDR sales are used for future land protection); and

3.    Catalyze city-county TDR agreements by strategically acquiring development rights from high priority conservation rural/resource lands in the County that are of compelling interest for specific cities to see protected.

Letter of intent, TDR certification: A signed letter provided by the City documenting availability of development rights for sale from a sending site. For those sending sites outside the City limits, this letter will be provided by King County.

Park: Land acquired for public use for active or passive recreational use.

Public Open Space: Property owned by the City of Issaquah, King County or State Departments of Parks and Recreation and Natural Resources that is set aside to serve the purposes of protecting and conserving critical areas and natural systems.

Stewardship plan: A comprehensive plan for the long-term protection and use of property (open space or park) protected through the TDR Program, developed by the property owner, monitored and enforced by the City of Issaquah. If prepared for privately held property, the plan must be approved by the City. Regardless, the plan must include:

1.    A course of action that prevents degradation of the values, structure and functions of the natural resources and open space and includes enhancements, as necessary, to improve the open space qualities of the property;

2.    An inventory of the existing conditions as well as all critical areas and their buffers;

3.    A plan showing any existing or proposed park improvements, protected natural areas and proposed enhancements;

4.    A timeline for implementing any enhancements and follow-up monitoring and maintenance; and

5.    A funding plan including personnel, capital and surety for implementation of the stewardship plan.

(Ord. 2684 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013).


18.10.2040 Sending TDRs – Certification, application and procedures.

A.    Qualifying a Sending Site for the Transfer of Development Rights:

1.    Eligibility: In order to sell or transfer development rights, the property owner must receive certification from either the City, or King County consistent with the provisions of the City’s TDR interlocal agreement.

2.    Calculation of TDRs:

a.    Inside City Limits: The Designated Official shall review the application and calculate the allowable number of development rights for the sending site.

i.    For residentially zoned sending sites, the TDR base density shall be calculated as defined in IMC 18.10.450, Density calculations in critical areas. Developable units on a subject property equal the property’s TDR base density. For parcels zoned SF-E (1.24 du/acre), the TDR base density shall be calculated beginning with four (4) dwelling units per acre and then calculated as defined in IMC 18.10.450, Density calculations in critical areas.

ii.    For nonresidentially zoned properties, the TDR base density shall be calculated based on the maximum buildable square footage of the buildable area on the site divided by one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet.

b.    Outside City Limits: The maximum transferable number of development rights by a sending site outside of the City limits shall be established through the King County certification process as required by the Issaquah/King County interlocal agreement. Each TDR unit certified by King County in this manner may be used by an Issaquah receiving site with the same process and requirements of an “Inside City Limits” sending site TDR unit.

3.    TDR Certificate Letter of Intent: When located in the City, the Designated Official shall prepare and issue a TDR certificate letter of intent for the sending site which documents the available development rights on said sending site. When any of these development rights are certified, the letter of intent shall also be reissued to reflect the new amount of remaining development rights.

4.    TDR Certificate Letter of Intent Revision Request: The applicant may request, in writing, that the Designated Official revise the TDR certificate within ninety (90) days of the issuance of the TDR certification letter of intent when:

a.    The development rights have not been sold; and

b.    The applicant demonstrates that the TDR rights were improperly calculated; or

c.    The applicant provides additional studies, data or other information demonstrating that an adjustment of the TDR rights would be appropriate.

B.    TDR Certification:

1.    Certifying TDRs:

a.    Inside City Limits: The Designated Official shall certify the transferable development rights from a sending site, as required in subsection (B)(2) of this section, TDR Certificate Content. After the sale or transfer of all or a portion of a sending site’s TDRs, and the designation of the specific area(s) of the property as permanent open space as required in subsection (B)(3) of this section is completed, the TDR certificate may be issued.

b.    Outside City Limits: TDR certification on sending sites outside the City limits within King County shall be as required by Chapter 21A.37 KCC.

c.    Prior to the release of building permits, the receiving site applicant shall deliver the TDR certificate(s) to the City and a quit claim deed and extinguishment document shall be recorded on the sending site(s) and receiving site after approval of the receiving site project.

2.    TDR Certificate Content: A TDR certificate is a recorded document, showing the number of development rights available from a qualified sending site to be used by a TDR receiving site and shall delineate the number of development rights including:

a.    The number of transferred rights or ERUs; and

b.    The number of peak hour trips; and

c.    The amount of impervious surface transferable to a TDR receiving site or the additional square footage of gross floor area (above the base building height or maximum building height established in IMC 18.07.360, District standards table, for the underlying zoning district of the TDR receiving site) transferable to a TDR receiving site.

3.    Preservation of Open Space or Dedication of Park Land Resulting from TDR Conversion: As part of the development rights transfer and prior to the issuance of the TDR certificate, the sending site property owner is required to document that the site, or portion of the site, is no longer developable and shall be preserved to fulfill the intent of this chapter in one (1) of the following ways, as determined by the Designated Official:

a.    By Deed: The sending site property owner shall deed the ownership of the property to the City subject to dedicating the property as public open space or public park land. The dedication shall include a restriction on future development and on the installation of new utilities except:

i.    To allow any third party with right under an existing ingress, egress, utility, or similar easement that was established or recorded prior to the effective date of said easement to exercise such rights; and

ii.    To use and maintain linear or underground utilities; provided, that any area disturbed by such activity is promptly restored to the original grade and revegetated.

b.    By Conservation Easement: For open space properties only, the sending site property may retain title to the property by recording a conservation easement in perpetuity over the parcel. The conservation easement shall be to the benefit of the City, publicly recorded with King County, on a form approved by the City; and include the preparation and implementation of a stewardship plan to ensure the property is maintained for the benefit and protection of the natural resources, including wildlife, scenic corridors, and water quality. All conservation easements shall allow City access to the property to ensure compliance with the conservation easement. The conservation easement shall include:

i.    All of the critical area and associated buffer; and

ii.    That portion of the developable site area equal to the percentage of TDRs sold and certified.

c.    For sending sites purchased by the City, where the City wishes to sell all or some of the TDRs, the City shall record a declaration of covenant in perpetuity over the property, which shall include all of the critical area and a portion of the developable site area as required for property retained in private property and shall include the preparation of a stewardship plan as required in subsection (B)(3)(b) of this section, preservation of open space.

4.    Reissuing TDR Certificates: The Designated Official shall administer the TDR program by reissuing or retiring certificates when some or all of a parcel’s development rights have been transferred. A TDR certificate must be reissued and recorded after the sale of TDRs to the receiving site owner and the recording of a conservation easement, covenant or deeding of the sending site property as public open space or park land. The reissued TDR certificate shall clearly state the number of remaining TDRs available for that sending site parcel. If no TDRs are available, that information shall also be recorded.

C.    Determining the Number of Units Remaining on a Sending Site:

1.    Transferring All of the TDRs: All or a portion of the TDRs certified by the Designated Official may be sold. If all of the TDRs are transferred, no further development shall occur on the sending site and the entire parcel shall remain in permanent open space or park land in perpetuity, forestry or agriculture in accordance with the provisions of subsection (B)(3) of this section.

2.    Transferring TDRs Over Time: TDRs from a sending site may be sold over time to more than one (1) receiving site until all development rights are sold or the property owner chooses to develop the remainder of the property.

3.    Calculating Any Remaining Density on the Sending Site: If only a portion of the TDR units from a sending site are sold and transferred, the number of dwelling units or, in the case of commercially zoned land, the buildable square footage permitted on the remainder property, shall be determined in accordance with the conservation easement and provisions of IMC 18.10.450, Density calculations in critical areas, based on the percentage of critical area on the site. (Ord. 2684 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013).


18.10.2050 Receiving TDRs – Standards, applications and procedures.

A.    Standards for Transferring Development Rights to a Receiving Site: Certified development rights can be accommodated on a receiving site based on the following design and development criteria:

18.12.010 Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for the regulation of landscaping and trees within the City of Issaquah. The intent is to establish general minimum landscape standards to provide beautification of the community by requiring well-designed green spaces that buffer high intensity urban uses and integrate good landscaping design principles. It is also the City’s intent to preserve the benefits that trees provide to the community, to mitigate where tree loss cannot be avoided, to maintain and enhance canopy coverage and to provide for the effective removal of hazard trees to protect public health and safety. The specific objectives of these regulations as they pertain to the environment, safety and aesthetics are as follows:

A.    The Environment: Protect and enhance the environment including:

1.    Improve and protect water quality and aesthetics of streams and wetlands;

2.    Retain significant trees and preserve the natural forested character of Issaquah;

3.    Minimize erosion and stormwater runoff;

4.    Provide adequate spacing for proper growth and root development of trees and other vegetation;

5.    Promote wise and efficient use of water;

6.    Require retention of native vegetation and associated soils where appropriate and ensure that other required pervious surfaces include properly amended soils; and

7.    Minimize the use of pesticides and other landscape chemicals in order to protect public health and the environment.

B.    Safety: Provide the minimum requirements and standards to promote safety, including:

1.    Promote pedestrian and vehicular safety;

2.    Require adequate access for Fire and Police Departments; and

3.    Require proper landscape maintenance practices to minimize landscape hazards; for example, proper tree pruning.

C.    Aesthetics: Protect and enhance the aesthetic assets of the community, including:

1.    Encourage healthy, attractive year-round landscapes throughout Issaquah;

2.    Provide visual relief from large expanses of parking areas and reduction of perceived building scale;

3.    Diminish impacts of noise, glare and heat;

4.    Provide screening between incompatible land uses to reduce conflicts and to safeguard privacy;

5.    Provide visual screens and barriers as a transition between differing land uses to protect the aesthetic assets of the dissimilar land uses;

6.    Maintain and protect property values and enhance the general appearance of Issaquah; and

7.    Provide shade in urban heat islands, filter air and reduce stormwater runoff. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2481 § 7, 2006; Ord. 2383 § 6, 2004; Ord. 2108 § 12.1, 1996; Ord. 1877 § 1, 1991; Ord. 1859 §§ 1, 2, 1990; Ord. 1333 § 2, 1978).


18.12.020 Applicability.

A.    Application of Provisions: 

1.    Landscaping: The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all zoned property and public rights-of-way in the City. Landscaping, irrigation, tree and vegetation resource plans are required for all public and private projects, except for existing lots in individual single family use; provided, that developer-installed landscaping in common areas of residential projects shall not be exempt. (See IMC 18.12.135 for additional landscape requirements for all zones regarding blank walls abutting public right-of-way and retaining walls.)

2.    Tree Management: These provisions are applicable to all existing development, redevelopment, new development, and vacant or undeveloped lands within the City of Issaquah. No person shall remove, excessively prune, or top any protected, non-protected or significant tree except as provided by this chapter.

B.    Nonconforming Landscaping Situations. When an addition, alteration, or repair of any existing building or structure exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of an existing building or structure, such building or structure and the associated site shall be made to conform to the requirements of this chapter. When gross floor area with a value of fifty (50) percent or less of the existing structure value is added to a structure, said nonconforming structure and/or site shall be made to conform to the requirements of this chapter in a proportionate manner which shall be no less than a percentage of required landscaping area and plantings equal to the percentage of increase in gross floor area. The added landscaping may be required to be grouped into a single area with priority given to consistency with the required landscape types and visibility from a public street or other public area. This landscaping may be required to displace paving or other impervious material including one (1) or more parking spaces in excess of required parking.

C.    Administrative Adjustment of Landscaping Standards. The Planning Director/Manager may approve exceptions to the regulations when all of the following are met:

1.    The applicant can document that meeting the requirements would cause undue hardship due to pre-existing conditions on site, such as existing location of structures or vegetation.

2.    The deviation from the standards meets the landscape requirements to the highest degree possible and is the minimum variation needed.

3.    Other measures to meet the purpose and intent of this Landscape Code may be required to substitute for the required landscaping, such as decorative fencing, walls, arbors, or trellises, with appropriate vegetation.

4.    The proposed landscaping represents an equal or better result than that which could be achieved by strictly following the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2549 § 5, 2009; Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2481 § 8, 2006; Ord. 2383 § 6, 2004; Ord. 2108 § 12.2, 1996; Ord. 1859 § 3, 1990; Ord. 1333 § 3, 1978).

a.    Avoid Disturbing Tree: Avoid disturbing the tree at all unless it represents a hazard as determined by an arborist;

b.    Stabilize Tree: Stabilize the tree, if possible, using approved arboricultural methods such as cable and bracing in conjunction with other practices to rejuvenate the tree such as repairing damaged bark and trunk wounds, mulching, application of fertilizer, and improving aeration of the tree root zones;

c.    Pruning: Remove limbs from the tree, such as removing dead or broken branches, or by reducing branch end weights. If needed, remove up to one-quarter (1/4) of the branches from the canopy and main trunk only in small amounts, unless greater pruning is needed by approval of the arborist;

d.    Wildlife Tree: Create a wildlife tree or snag, or cut the tree down to a safe condition, without disturbing the roots, where the tree no longer poses a hazard. To create snags, remove all branches from the canopy, girdle deciduous trees, and leave the main trunk standing. Wildlife trees or snags are most appropriate in greenbelts, NPGEs, vacant property, and environmentally critical areas;

e.    Steep Slopes: Removal of tree roots on steep slopes may require a geotechnical evaluation;

f.    Creeks and Lakes: Trees fallen into creeks and lakes are to remain in place unless they create a hazard; and

g.    Provide professional recommendations on:

(1)    The necessity of removal, including alternative measures to removal;

(2)    The lowest-impact approach to removal;

(3)    A replacement tree plan, if required.

D.    Tree Removal Exemptions: A tree removal form or permit is not required for:

1.    Removal of non-significant trees that are not protected by any other means.

2.    Removal of trees in association with right-of-way and easements. Tree removal by a public agency or a franchised utility within a public right-of-way or upon an easement, for the purpose of installing and maintaining water, storm, sewer, power, gas or communication lines, or motorized or non-motorized streets or paths. Notification to the City by the public agency or franchised utility is required prior to tree maintenance or removal within City-owned rights-of-way.

3.    Tree removal in association with mineral resource extraction or processing in a mineral resource zone regulated under IMC 18.07.525, Mineral Resource Zone (“M”) development standards.

4.    Emergency Removal: Any number of hazardous protected and nonprotected trees may be removed under emergency conditions. Emergency conditions include immediate danger to life or dwellings or similar stationary and valuable property, including the presence of a target. Emergency removal may occur and all the following conditions shall be met:

a.    The City is notified the following business day of the unpermitted action;

b.    Visual documentation (i.e., photographs, video, etc.) is made available; and

c.    The felled tree remains on site for City inspection.

(2)    Single Family Use: The property owner will not be required to provide replacement trees.

e.    Should the City determine that the tree(s) did not pose an emergency condition, the owner shall be cited for a violation of the terms of this chapter. (Ord. 2596 § 2 (Exh. B1), 2010; Ord. 2562 § 3 (Exh. B2), 2009; Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008).


18.12.1385 Tree retention requirements.

A.    Tree Retention Requirements:

1.    General Tree Retention Requirements: Significant trees on lots proposed for project development or redevelopment shall be retained as follows:

IMC 18.12.1385(A) Tree Retention Requirements for Proposed Project Development 

	Zoning Designation:	Retention Required:

	Single family, duplex, short plats, or subdivision development (SF-E, SF-S, SF-SL, SF-D, C-Res)	30% of the total caliper (dbh) of all significant trees in developable site area

	Commercial and multifamily development (Multifamily (MUR, MF-M, MF-H), Professional Office (PO), Cultural and Business District (CBD), Retail (R) and Intensive Commercial (IC), and Urban Village (UV))	25% of the total caliper (dbh) of all significant trees in developable site area

2.    Urban Village Tree Retention Requirements: Tree Retention standards do not apply to the Issaquah Highlands and Talus Urban Villages. These tree retention standards will apply to future Urban Village designations unless other tree retention standards are specifically included in the Urban Village Development Agreement.

3.    Priority of Tree Retention Requirements: Significant trees shall be retained in the following priority order:

a.    Priority One:

(1)    Significant trees which form a continuous canopy;

(2)    Significant trees on slopes greater than twenty (20) percent;

(3)    Significant trees adjacent to critical areas and their associated buffers;

(4)    Significant trees over sixty (60) feet in height or greater than eighteen (18) inches dbh.

b.    Priority Two:

(1)    Healthy tree groupings whose associated undergrowth can be preserved;

(2)    Other significant native evergreen or deciduous trees; and

(3)    Other significant nonnative trees.

c.    Priority Three: Alders and cottonwoods shall be retained when all other trees have been evaluated for retention and are not able to be retained except where adjacent to open space, wetlands or creek buffers.

B.    Modification to Tree Retention Requirements: A reduction of up to fifty (50) percent of the tree retention requirements of all development may be approved by the Planning Director/Manager through a Level 2 Review process, or a Level 1 Review process for individual single family projects, provided the following criteria are met:

1.    The modification is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, Chapter 18.12 IMC, Landscaping and Tree Preservation; and

2.    The modification incorporates the retention of a grouping(s) of smaller trees that make up the equivalent diameter inches and retains other natural vegetation occurring in association with the smaller tree grouping(s); and

3.    The modification is necessary because the size, shape, topography, or location of the subject property may jeopardize the reasonable use of the property and reasonable alternatives do not exist; and

4.    The modification is necessary because the required ingress/egress, existing and proposed utility locations, trails, storm drainage improvements or similar constraints may jeopardize the reasonable use of the property and reasonable alternatives do not exist; and

5.    The modification is necessary to provide solar access to a building that incorporates active solar devices. Windows are solar devices only when they are south-facing and include special storage elements to distribute heat energy.

C.    Additional Tree Protection: The Planning Director/Manager may approve an administrative adjustment of standards, including but not limited to IMC 18.07.330, Setbacks, and IMC 18.09.060, Administrative adjustment of parking standards, in order to retain existing healthy significant tree(s). (Ord. 2596 § 2 (Exh. B1), 2010; Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008).


18.12.1390 Replacement trees.

A.    Replacement Tree Requirement: Trees removed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be replaced per the following criteria:

1.    For tree removal associated with a commercial or multifamily revision to an approved landscape plan, replacement may be calculated based on meeting the landscape plan purpose and intent. This may include: adjustments to the timing of replacement up to six (6) months, or to the size of replacement trees up to one (1) inch, when justification can be provided that the changes meet or exceed the original landscape plan.

2.    For All Other Tree Removal: One (1) replacement tree for every six (6) inches of caliper at dbh of trees removed if remaining tree density is below the minimum requirements in IMC 18.12.1370, Minimum tree density requirements.

D.    City Tree Fund: Where it is not feasible to relocate or replace trees on site or off site as established in the approved tree plan, the applicant may be required to pay into the City tree fund an amount of money approximating the current market value of the replacement trees and the labor to install them.

E.    Value: The value of significant and protected trees shall be established according to the formula outlined in the most recent edition of the Guide for Plant Appraisal, published by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. This value shall be determined by the City. (Ord. 2596 § 2 (Exh. B1), 2010; Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008).

Standards and Specifications


18.12.140 Landscape standards and specifications.

The following landscape standards and specifications shall apply to all landscaping required under this chapter or other requirement of City ordinance. The Planning Director/Manager or City Horticulturist is authorized to make adjustments to the following standards on a case-by-case basis using best professional judgment.

A.    Centennial Tree: “Eddie’s White Wonder” Dogwood (Cornus “Eddie’s White Wonder”) has been chosen as Issaquah’s official Centennial Tree. Developers are therefore encouraged to use it as a single specimen or in small group plantings.

B.    Drainage: All landscapes shall have adequate drainage, either through natural percolation or through an installed drainage system. A percolation rate of one-half (1/2) inch of water per hour is acceptable. Wetland and riparian landscapes choosing to use LID techniques, as part of a LID stormwater element, shall follow the guidelines of the LID Technical Guidance Manual, as amended.

C.    Use of Chemical Applications: The use of plant material or maintenance practices requiring excessive fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide applications to be kept healthy and attractive shall not be allowed. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies shall be incorporated into landscape design and maintenance whenever possible.

1.    Fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide applications, only when necessary, shall be done with herbicide classified as safe for aquatic environments and shall be made in a manner that will prevent their entry into waterways and wetlands and minimize their entry into storm drains. No applications shall be made within fifty (50) feet of a waterway or wetland, or its associated buffer as established by the City codes, such as the critical areas regulations (Chapter 18.10 IMC, Environmental Protection), unless done so by a state-certified applicator with prior City approval.

2.    All applications to turf or trees and shrubs shall follow Washington State University Extension Office, National Arborist Association or other accepted agronomic or horticultural guidelines as well as the product guidelines.

D.    Irrigation: A permanent, efficient irrigation system shall be installed in all landscapes unless exempted pursuant to this section. The system shall be designed to conserve water by using best available conservation technology and irrigation best management practices. These techniques may include, but are not limited to: subsurface or drip irrigation to minimize evaporation loss, moisture sensors or rain sensors to prevent irrigation during rainy periods, weather-based automatic controllers to ensure proper duration of watering, sprinkler head selection and spacing designed to minimize overspray, use of plants with similar water needs, soil moisture sensors and separate zones for turf and shrub hydrozones and microclimates to meet watering needs of different sections of the landscape. Exceptions to the irrigation requirement, as approved by the Planning Director/Manager or designated official, may be made for: street-tree-only plantings, approved xeriscape (low water usage) plantings, landscaping using drought-tolerant plants, established indigenous plant material, landscaping in conjunction with low impact development stormwater systems or landscapes where natural appearance is acceptable or desirable to the City. In those situations where irrigation is necessary, the following shall be required for all landscape irrigation areas:

1.    Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid runoff, low-head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows onto adjacent property, nonirrigated area, or impervious surfaces by:

a.    Considering soil type and infiltration rates;

b.    Using proper irrigation equipment and schedules, including such features as repeat cycles, and matched precipitation and infiltration rates; and

c.    Considering special problems posed by irrigation on slopes, in median strips, and in narrow hydrozones.

2.    Irrigation systems shall be designed and installed to have a minimum distribution uniformity of 0.65 or greater per IMC 18.12.145(E), Irrigation System Review and Audit at Installation.

3.    Landscape water features shall use nonpotable water unless the water feature is designed to both minimize water loss and recirculate water used in operation (required for all landscapes).

4.    Irrigation systems shall utilize a master control valve connected to a flow sensor and irrigation controller.

5.    Irrigation systems shall include a rain or soil moisture sensor designed to shut off or override watering during rainfall events.

6.    Irrigation systems in right-of-way medians, curb strips, parking lots or other landscape strips of less than five (5) feet in width or turf-grass exceeding a slope of three horizontal feet to one vertical foot (3:1) provided through a low-volume, subsurface irrigation system providing a distribution uniformity of not less than 0.90.

7.    Irrigation systems shall be designed with provisions for winterization by providing either:

a.    Manual drains (automatic valves are not permitted) at all low points; or

b.    Method to blow out irrigation system pipes with pressurized air.

8.    Irrigation Maintenance: Irrigation systems shall be maintained and inspected periodically to assure proper functioning, adjust scheduling and to meet irrigation water budget requirements. Replacement of components shall be original specified parts or materials, or their equivalents.

E.    Waterwise Planting Requirements, Mulches and Soil Amendments: The following planting, mulching and topsoil amendments shall be required for all landscape areas:

1.    Plants having similar water use characteristics (hydrozones) shall be grouped together.

2.    Soil amendments may be necessary to produce a healthy growing medium, which will increase the survival rate for new planting and reduce ongoing maintenance requirements.

3.    Incorporate water and nutrient holding materials into the soil as deep as possible (a minimum of twelve (12) inches). Use fully composted organic material.

4.    Mulch new planting areas to minimize evaporation, suppress weed growth and reduce erosion. Use fully composted material. All mulches used in planter beds shall be feathered to the base of the plants and kept at least six (6) inches away from the crowns of shrubs or trunks of trees.

5.    Water tubes can also be added to the tree plantings to allow water to penetrate the soil.

6.    The Planning Director/Manager may exempt a project from some or all of the required irrigation plan in exchange for the proper installation of mulches, soil amendments and plantings. A temporary irrigation system may be required until the planting material is established.

F.    Plant Selection: All plants shall be adapted to their sites (sun exposure, cold hardiness, moisture requirements, soil type, soil pH, etc.). Plants with differing environmental/cultural requirements shall not be used together if desirable circumstances cannot be provided for both. New plant materials shall consist of native or drought-tolerant varieties or nonnative species that have adapted to the climate conditions of the greater Issaquah region (see the list of native trees and shrubs for wildlife habitat in the Issaquah area available at Permit Center). All plants shall be selected taking into consideration the mature size of the plant and the space allowed for the plant to grow unobstructed (i.e., large native conifers are not appropriate in densely built areas and narrow planter beds). Plants shall be selected that are appropriate for the provided space in order to minimize persistent pruning. No plants shall be allowed that are determined to be noxious weeds per the King County Noxious Weed Control Board pursuant to the State Weed Control Law, Chapter 17.10 RCW.

G.    Plant Sizes and Spacing: Standard plant sizes and spacing requirements for new landscape areas shall follow the guidelines for selection and spacing based on the ultimate size and growth habits of the plants as defined in the ANSI Z60.1-2004 or the most recent edition of the guide. Flexibility with the general spacing requirements below may be approved by the Planning Director/Manager if the applicant can show that the overall effect of the landscape plan can meet the purpose of the landscape requirements per IMC 18.12.010, Purpose and intent. Spacing shall be as follows:

1.    Ground Covers: Spacing is dependent on the type and size of the plant material used and must be adequate to provide total coverage of the landscape area within three (3) years. In existing woodlands, the spacing of ground covers may be allowed to be spaced further apart per the approval of the Planning Director/Manager. In general:

a.    Four (4) inch pots shall be spaced twelve (12) inches on center in a triangular planting arrangement.

b.    One (1) gallon pots shall be spaced eighteen (18) inches in a triangular planting arrangement or to cover in three (3) years.

c.    All mulched ground cover areas shall have ground cover established and covering the area with growing plant material within three (3) years.

H.    Berms: If berms are used, they shall be planted with trees, shrubs and living ground cover and must be adequately planted to prevent erosion.

1.    Berms planted with sod lawn shall be no steeper than a three to one (3:1) ratio.

2.    Planted slopes with erosion control plants and ground covers shall be no steeper than a two to one (2:1) ratio.

3.    Any berms over two to one (2:1) must have erosion control netting or matting installed in addition to the required plantings.

I.    Plant Standards: All plant materials used shall meet the most recent American Association of Nurseryman Standards (ANSI Z60.1) for nursery stock.

J.    Tree Pruning:

1.    All pruning shall be done to the most recent National Arborist Association Standards: ANSI Z133.1 (2001) for safety factors and Z300 (part 1) for pruning. It is recommended that all pruning be done to Class I (Fine Pruning), Class II (Standard Pruning), or Class III (Hazard Pruning) standards. Class IV (Crown Reduction Pruning) shall only be done for the following reasons:

a.    Branches interfering with utility lines.

b.    Significant crown dieback has occurred.

c.    Storm damage or prior incorrect pruning requires correction.

2.    In no case is topping (the severe reduction of branches without consideration of the specifications for cutting back) allowed.

3.    No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total canopy may be removed unless approved by the City’s Horticulturist.

K.    Shrub Pruning: Shrubs used for screening purposes shall have a predetermined minimum desired height shown on the landscape plan. The shrubbery shall be required to fill in and create an adequate screen to reduce headlight glare to surrounding properties. Once the desired height is reached, they shall not be pruned below that height. Shearing is allowed for hedges, but specimen plants are to be selectively pruned according to their plant type, not sheared. Visual access to meet CPTED standards shall be incorporated where necessary as shown on the landscape plan.

L.    Pedestrian Pathways: Grass or other ground covers tolerant to foot traffic shall be used in areas of pedestrian traffic flow. In areas where there is heavy pedestrian traffic flow, dense shrubbery shall be required to direct pedestrian traffic flow onto designated pathways.

M.    Landscaping Area Size Requirements:

1.    Larger planting beds are more likely to be successful than small ones. Therefore, planting bed size shall be as large as practical for each site. All required tree planting areas shall be a minimum of one hundred (100) square feet with a minimum width of five (5) feet.

2.    Island planting beds in parking lots or similar situations shall have a minimum dimension of eight (8) feet from inside of curb.

3.    Tree wells shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) square feet depending on size potential of the tree; however, the use of continuous landscape beds or lawns is considered preferable to individual tree wells.

4.    Planting holes shall be three (3) times the diameter of the rootball of the plant material and shall be back-filled following planting guidelines available at the Permit Center.

N.    Tree and Vegetation Protection: In order to provide adequate protection of trees and the landscaping area, the landscape design shall comply with the following standards:

1.    Protective devices such as bollards, trunk guards, root guards, etc., may be required to direct pedestrian or vehicular traffic away from the trees and their associated vegetation areas.

a.    Mulch may not be placed against the tree trunk above the soil line.

b.    Trees in lawn areas are required to have a mulched bed extending a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches in all directions from the base of the tree.

2.    Where vehicles may overhang into required landscaping areas, trees shall be located such that they will not be damaged by vehicles pulling in and out of parking stalls. Permanent curbing shall be provided in all landscaping areas within or abutting parking areas except where based upon appropriate surface water considerations; other structural barriers may be substituted for curbing, such as concrete wheel stops.

3.    Trees shall be sized appropriately and not be placed in areas where they will require excessive pruning (greater than twenty-five (25) percent of the canopy) such as in the sight line of project sign locations.

4.    For significant trees, tree stands and existing vegetation, the following additional requirements shall be met to protect vegetation from development impacts during construction:

a.    The applicant shall not fill, excavate, stack or store any equipment or compact the earth in any way within the area defined by the dripline of any tree to be retained.

b.    The applicant shall construct a temporary but immovable four (4) foot high sturdy fence around each tree or native vegetated area to be retained generally corresponding to the critical root zone of the trees.

c.    The applicant may not install impervious surface material within the area defined by the dripline of any trees to be retained unless specifically approved by the Planning Director/Manager.

d.    The grade level around any tree to be retained may not be lowered by more than two-thirds (2/3) of the area defined by the critical root zone of the tree. If the grade level around a tree to be retained is to be raised, the applicant shall construct a dry rock wall or rock well around the tree. The diameter of this wall or well must be equal to the diameter of the tree’s dripline.

O.    Waterway and Wetland Landscaping: Native plant species and plants deemed suitable for riparian habitat (as specified by the approved plant list available at the Permit Center) shall be used along streams and wetland buffer zones. 

P.    Soil Porosity: Soils in planting areas shall have adequate porosity to allow root growth. Soils which have been compacted to a density greater than eighty-five (85) percent compaction shall be loosened (ripped) to increase aeration to a minimum depth of eighteen (18) inches or to the depth of the largest plant rootball, whichever is greater. A minimum of eight (8) inches of topsoil, amended as appropriate for soil conditions and plant material selection, shall be tilled into soils in four (4) inch lifts to prevent a distinct soil interface from forming. After soil preparation is completed, motorized vehicles shall be kept off to prevent excessive compaction and underground pipe damage.

Q.    Soil Amendments – Compost, Topsoil and Seed Mix Specifications: All new landscape areas shall be required to amend soils to improve soil health and nutrient availability, increase porosity, infiltration and moisture holding capacity and shall meet minimum specifications for soils, compost, mulches and seed mixes.

1.    Subgrade shall be a minimum of eight (8) inches below finish grade. Substandard soils shall be removed prior to adding amendments.

2.    A soils analysis shall be completed for all new planting areas and shall include:

a.    A determination of soil texture, indicating percentage of organic matter.

b.    An approximated soil infiltration rate either measured or derived from soil/texture/infiltration rate tables.

c.    A measure of pH value.

3.    Soils for use in projects applying low impact development (LID) standards shall follow the LID Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound, Section 6.2, Amending Construction Site Soils.

4.    For soils that will not adequately percolate to provide proper drainage for plant materials, a plan to correct the situation shall be developed by the landscape architect and approved by the Planning Director/Manager.

5.    Guidelines for meeting minimum standards are available at the Permit Center and shall follow the Washington State University King County Extension Services guidelines for soil conditions and plant selection.

R.    Native Soil Protection: The conservation and use of on-site native soil and vegetation for stormwater management is a central principle of LID design. For management of native vegetation and soil protection areas for LID design see the LID Technical Guidance Manual (Chapter 4, Vegetation Protection, Reforestation and Maintenance, and Section 6.2, Amending Construction Site Soils).

1.    The duff layer and native topsoils shall be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent practicable. Any duff layer or topsoil removed during grading shall be stockpiled on site in a designated, controlled area not adjacent to public resources and critical areas. The material shall be reapplied to other portions of the site where feasible.

2.    Areas that have been cleared and graded or subject to prior disturbance shall be amended. Prior disturbance shall include soil compaction or removal of some or all of the duff layer or underlying topsoil. Replaced topsoil shall be a minimum of eight (8) to twelve (12) inches in depth, unless the applicant demonstrates that a different thickness will provide conditions equivalent to the soil moisture holding capacity native to the site. Replacement topsoil shall have an organic content of ten (10) percent dry weight and a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. The intent of amending disturbed soils is to restore the moisture holding capacity of the original undisturbed native soil to the maximum extent practicable.

3.    This section does not apply to areas that would harm existing trees proposed for retention, or that, at project completion, are covered by an impervious surface, incorporated into a drainage facility or engineered as structural fill or slope. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2481 § 9, 2006; Ord. 2108 § 12.16, 1996; Ord. 1877 §§ 4 – 6, 1991; Ord. 1859 § 30, 1990. Formerly 18.12.160).

F.    Provide a separate plan for supervising and/or monitoring implementation of any required tree protection or replacement measures. (Ord. 2596 § 2 (Exh. B1), 2010; Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008).


18.12.145 Irrigation water budgeting requirements.

Irrigation water budgeting requirements shall apply to all landscaping required under this chapter or other requirement of City ordinance. Irrigation systems shall conform to landscape standards and specifications as outlined in IMC 18.12.140, Landscape standards and specifications. The Planning Director/Manager is authorized to make adjustments to standards on a case-by-case basis using best professional judgment.

A.    Irrigation Water Budget: A landscape design’s irrigation water budget (IWB) shall be calculated based upon the total square footage of the proposed landscape area and including landscape water features (such as decorative ponds, pools or fountains) and excluding impervious surfaces and sensitive areas and their buffers. The irrigation water budget shall be calculated as described in the “Irrigation Water Budgeting Requirements” handout available at the Permit Center.

B.    Irrigation Design Estimated Water Use: A landscape design’s estimated water use (EWU) shall be calculated by determining the estimated water use for each hydrozone and adding the EWU for all hydrozones together. The sum of the EWU for all hydrozones is the landscape’s total EWU. The formula used to determine the estimated water use for each hydrozone is available in the “Irrigation Water Budgeting Requirements” handout available at the Permit Center.

C.    Plant Factor Values: Plant factor values shall be used for all plant species selected for use in a landscape. The plant factor value for the hydrozone shall be that of the plant species with the highest plant factor value within the hydrozone. Plant factor values assigned shall reflect the plant species’ actual water demand as planted according to the final landscape design and plan.

D.    Irrigation System Efficiency Values: Irrigation system efficiency values (IE) shall be assigned in calculating the estimated water use for each hydrozone of a landscape. Determination of the IE shall be as described in the “Irrigation Water Budgeting Requirements” handout available at the Permit Center.

E.    Irrigation System Review and Audit at Installation: The irrigation system shall be designed, installed and maintained in such a manner as to meet a minimum distribution uniformity of not less than 0.65. Prior to final approval of the irrigation and landscape, all installed irrigation systems must successfully pass an irrigation system audit and meet a minimum distribution uniformity of 0.65. The irrigation system audit shall be performed by an Irrigation Association certified landscape irrigation auditor (CLIA), registered landscape architect or professional engineer with irrigation design experience. Irrigation system audit certification shall be submitted for review and approval prior to approval of the landscape and irrigation.

F.    Irrigation Schedule: An irrigation schedule shall be submitted with the irrigation plan. (Ord. 2596 § 2 (Exh. B1), 2010; Ord. 2587 § 3 (Exh. B2), 2010; Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007).

Any trees selected for use on public property which are not on the list shall require approval by the City. This list shall be subject to periodic updating by the City and shall be available at the Permit Center.

B.    The City shall have an approved set of specifications from which developers may select grass seed combinations (including sod) for use on public property. Any seed combination not on the list shall require approval by the City. Alternative cross-sections of the planting strip on City right-of-way for the use of trees, shrubs and drought-tolerant materials to replace sod shall require approval by the Planning Director/Manager.

C.    The City shall be responsible for the maintenance of all developed landscape areas owned by the City, except for right-of-way, unless otherwise agreed upon by the City.

D.    Maintenance of landscape areas (including irrigation systems, ornamental plantings and other landscape elements) on City right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner unless the City has accepted maintenance responsibility for that right-of-way. Any tree removal shall require City approval (see Issaquah Street Standards and Specifications, Chapter 12.04 IMC).

E.    Permission by the City shall be required before any plant may be planted or removed from City property or public right-of-way.

F.    Plant location and spacing on City right-of-way must meet all sight obstruction requirements (see Issaquah City Street Standards and Specifications). Plantings on City right-of-way shall not obstruct the visibility or accessibility of any fire hydrant (see Fire Hydrant Construction Standards) or traffic control device. The trees may be spaced at irregular intervals in order to accommodate sight distance requirements for driveways, intersections or traffic control devices.

G.    Street trees shall have a minimum overhead clearance of seven (7) feet over pedestrian pathways and fourteen (14) feet over streets at maturity. Street trees shall be centered a minimum of three (3) feet from curbs and two (2) feet from sidewalks or as otherwise approved by the City.

H.    Street trees planted in tree wells in sidewalks shall have a minimum of two and one-half (2-1/2) feet of pedestrian clearance around the tree unless otherwise approved by the City (see Issaquah City

Street Standards and Specifications, Chapter 12.04 IMC). Tree grates may be required to meet ADA accessibility requirements.

I.    Street trees shall be planted in a planting strip with a minimum of five (5) feet between the sidewalk and the back of the curb. Permanent or temporary irrigation shall be required for a minimum of three (3) years.

J.    Trees planted under overhead utility wires shall be of a small variety (as specified by the Approved Street Tree List) which will not grow up to interfere with the wires.

K.    Street trees shall be required in all rights-of-way unless an exception is approved by the Planning Director/Manager and shall be a minimum of two (2) inch caliper at the time of planting unless they are of a small variety (as specified by the Approved Street Tree List or specified in the Master Street Tree Plan) or an exception has been granted by the City. Street trees shall be limbed up a minimum of five (5) feet when planted, following the standards provided in ANSI Z133.1-2004. The minimum tree pit size in a tree well shall be sixteen (16) square feet and the minimum tree pit shall be three (3) times the size of the rootball. If a street tree or other tree or shrub on City property is removed, broken or otherwise damaged it shall be considered a violation of subsection E of this section and subject to fine. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2108 § 12.17, 1996; Ord. 1859 § 31, 1990. Formerly 18.12.170).


18.12.160 Maintenance – Landscape bond required and tree maintenance.

A.    Landscape Bond Required and Procedures:

1.    All landscapes need to be maintained in a safe, healthy and attractive manner in perpetuity. All existing landscapes within the City shall also be kept weed and litter free and the plant material shall be maintained in good growing condition. The property owner shall replace any unhealthy or dead plant materials in conformance with the approved landscape plans and shall maintain all landscape material. The property owner is the responsible entity to ensure the landscaping is maintained in an appropriate manner, regardless of any second party landscape maintenance agreements.

2.    To insure that all plant material used in landscapes shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition, a cash deposit or other acceptable security worth fifty (50) percent of the value of the landscaped plant material, cost of labor, irrigation and materials shall be posted with the City prior to receipt of a temporary or final Certificate of Occupancy. The cash deposit will be returned in three (3) years if the plants remain in a healthy growing condition and have achieved full coverage (replacement of all plants will not be required if full coverage has been met). The Planning Director/Manager may accept other suitable security as permitted in Chapter 18.04 IMC, Procedures.

3.    If any portion of the required landscaping dies within three (3) years, the City shall notify the property owner, in writing, and require replacement within sixty (60) days. If the landscape is not replaced within the specified time period, the City may use whatever portion of the deposit is needed to replace the dead landscaping. The City may use either City employees or private contractors to replace the landscaping, and may assess the property owner all actual costs against the deposit, if it is sufficient. An additional three (3) year cash deposit or other security device at fifty (50) percent of the value of the landscaping may be required at the discretion of the Planning Director/Manager if a significant amount of the plants need to be replaced.

4.    Regular maintenance procedures shall be as follows:

a.    Litter pickup;

b.    Mowing turf;

c.    Edging turf;

d.    Weeding planting beds;

e.    Sweeping;

f.    Irrigation;

g.    Fertilization as needed per manufacturer’s specifications to keep plants healthy and actively growing;

h.    All mulches used in planter beds shall be kept at least six (6) inches away from the crown of shrubs and trees;

i.    Pruning to required heights and widths; and

j.    Pest and disease control (all chemical products and application methods shall be approved by the City Parks Department).

5.    It is recognized that these procedures may vary due to weather conditions, seasonal events, etc. The above guidelines are to serve as a standard for normal maintenance operations. 

B.    Tree Maintenance: The following regulations shall apply to all significant and protected trees. The City Arborist is authorized to make adjustments to the standards and requirements on a case-by-case basis using best professional judgment.

1.    An irrigation method, approved by the City, shall be provided to all newly planted protected trees through an establishment period.

2.    All pruning shall be done to the most recent ANSI standards (A300-1995 and Z133.1-1994). Canopy raising, canopy cleaning, and canopy thinning as defined in IMC 18.12.030, Definitions, are permitted; provided, that they do not meet the definition of excessive pruning in IMC 18.12.030, Definitions. No permit shall be required for maintenance pruning.

3.    Tree topping is prohibited, except under the following circumstances:

a.    Branches interfering with utility lines.

b.    Significant canopy dieback has occurred.

c.    Storm damage or prior incorrect pruning requires correction.

If illegal tree topping has occurred, the property owner shall have a certified arborist develop and implement a five (5) year pruning schedule in addition to monetary fines and required tree replacement.

4.    Excessive Pruning: Excessive pruning as defined in IMC 18.12.030, Definitions, is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2283 § 6, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 12.5, 1996; Ord. 1877 § 7, 1991; Ord. 1859 § 21, 1990; Ord. 1333 § 5, 1978. Formerly 18.12.050).

Administration and Enforcement


18.12.170 Administrative adjustment of standards – Landscaping.

A.    Unless otherwise specified, the Planning Department may vary the specific requirements of this chapter as set forth in the Administrative Adjustment of Standards (AAS) process. 

B.    AAS Purpose: The purpose and intent of Administrative Adjustment of landscaping standards is to provide the flexibility to reduce or modify standards in all zoning districts at the administrative level, without permitting an adjustment that negatively impacts the surrounding neighborhood. This provision requires a Level 2 Review, regardless of street frontage or parcel size, with public notification to adjacent property owners.

C.    AAS Process: The Planning Director/Manager has the authority to make the final decision regarding Administrative Adjustment of Standards for all levels of review. The Director/Manager shall consider the application information regarding the approval criteria which has been provided by the applicant and any public comment which has been received within the comment period. The Director/Manager may request input from the Chair of the Development Commission during the comment period; however, this is not required. The Planning Director/Manager’s decision on the Administrative Adjustment of Standards is final unless appealed. Appeals to Administrative Adjustment of Standards are addressed in Chapter 18.04 IMC.

D.    AAS Approval Criteria: Approval must be based on a determination that the adjustment is consistent with the purpose and intent of this Code and of the development standards. The following approval criteria, in addition to the approval criteria for a Level 2 Review, shall be used to determine whether an Administrative Adjustment shall be granted for landscape standards:

1.    The adjustment(s) will be equal to, or superior in, fulfilling the intent and purpose of the landscape requirements; and

2.    The adjustment(s) does not negatively impact the adjacent property owners; and

3.    The landscape adjustment(s) shall provide consistency with the intent, scale and character of the zoning district involved; and

4.    The intent and purpose of the required screening and/or buffering of uses or specific areas (for example, dumpsters and parking areas) are not jeopardized. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2108 § 12.14, 1996. Formerly 18.12.140).


18.12.175 Enforcement for landscape plans.

A.    Responsibility: The ultimate responsibility for any landscaping shall be borne by the legal owner of the property on which the landscaping is located. The Building Official or his/her designee may require, when necessary, that the property owner or agent be party to, or applicant for, any required landscaping permit.

B.    Authority: The Building Official is authorized and directed to enforce all provisions of this chapter and is empowered to promulgate such rules and regulations as may from time to time be necessary to accomplish the purpose of this chapter, subject to City Council approval.

C.    Violations: Violations of any portion of this chapter shall be subject to the applicable code enforcement and penalty provisions set out in Chapter 18.05 IMC, Enforcement. Violations include:

1.    The unauthorized removal of plant material from an approved or revised landscape planting. If a tree has been removed and only the stump remains, the size of the tree shall be the diameter of the top of the stump.

2.    Excessive pruning of vegetation, such as topping of trees. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008; Ord. 2497 § 7, 2007; Ord. 2108 § 12.15, 1996; Ord. 1333 § 9, 1978. Formerly 18.12.150).


18.12.176 Violation, enforcement and penalties for noncompliance of tree preservation requirements.

A.    Noncompliance with any other section of this chapter constitutes a violation of this Code.

B.    Enforcement Authority: It shall be the duty of the Planning Director to enforce this Code. The Director may call upon the police and other appropriate City officials or departments to assist in enforcing this Code. It is unlawful to violate any of the provisions of this Code and violators shall be punished in accordance with IMC 1.06.010, General penalties.

C.    General Provisions for Enforcement and Penalties:

1.    The enforcement provisions for tree protection are intended to encourage compliance and protect the City’s significant and protected trees. To achieve these ends, violators will not only be required to restore damaged or removed protected trees to the extent possible, but will incur a civil and/or criminal penalty for the redress of community ecological, aesthetic, and economic values lost or damaged. 

2.    The owner of the land on which the violation occurs shall be named as a party to the violation, except in cases of trespass. In addition to any other persons who may be liable for violations, the owner shall be jointly and severally liable for the restoration of a site and payment of any penalties imposed.

3.    Each violation of this Code, or any rule or regulation adopted, or any permit, permit condition, or order issued pursuant to this Code, shall be a separate offense.

4.    Aiding or Abetting: Any person who, through an act of commission or omission, procures, aids or abets in the violation shall be considered to have committed a violation for the purposes of the penalty.

D.    Penalties:

1.    Criminal Penalties: Any person violating any provisions of this chapter is subject to criminal penalties. A violation of this chapter is a gross misdemeanor and is punishable by a fine not to exceed $5,000 and imprisonment not to exceed one (1) year. Additionally, the City may be entitled to restitution for up to three (3) times the value of the trees removed or damaged as well as costs in replacing and restoring the damaged area and any other reasonable expenses incurred.

2.    Civil Penalties: Any person violating any provisions of this chapter shall have committed a civil infraction and may be subject to civil penalties in addition to any criminal penalties. Pursuant to Chapter 64.12 RCW, the City may be entitled to triple the amount of civil damages claimed or assessed. The extent of the penalty shall be determined according to one or more of the following:

a.    An amount reasonably determined by the Director to be equivalent to the costs estimated by the City to investigate and administer the infraction;

b.    The economic benefit that the violator derives from the violation (as measured by the greater of the resulting increase in market value of the property or the value received by the violator or savings of construction costs realized by the violator performing any act in violation of this chapter);

c.    The value lost of the trees removed versus that recovered through replacement plantings; and

d.    The cost of replacing and replanting the trees and restoring the disturbed area according to a specific plan approved by the City. Violators of this chapter or of a permit issued thereunder shall be responsible for restoring unlawfully damaged areas in conformance with a plan, approved by the Director, that provides for repair of any environmental and property damage, and restoration of the site; and which results in a site condition that, to the greatest extent practical, is equivalent to the site condition that would have existed in the absence of the violation(s). In cases where the violator intentionally or knowingly violated this chapter or has committed previous violations of this chapter, restoration costs may be based on the City-appraised tree value of the subject trees on which the violation occurred. If diameter of removed tree is unknown, determination of the diameter size shall be made by the City Arborist by comparing size of stump and species to similar trees in similar growing conditions.

e.    If illegal tree topping has occurred, the property owner shall be required to have a certified arborist develop and implement a five (5) year pruning schedule in addition to monetary fines and required tree replacement.

3.    Civil penalties under this section shall be imposed by a notice in writing, either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service, to the person incurring the same from the City. The notice shall describe the violation, approximate the date(s) of violation, and shall order the acts constituting the violation to cease and desist, or, in appropriate cases, require necessary corrective action within a specific time.

4.    Any fiscal penalty recovered under this section shall be deposited in the City’s tree fund as established in IMC 18.12.180, City tree fund.

E.    Notices and Citations: The Director is authorized to issue notices and administrative orders, levy fines, and/or institute legal actions in court.

1.    Recourse to any single remedy shall not preclude recourse to any of the other remedies.

2.    The Director may issue a stop work order for any approved development activity for the property on which or adjacent to which a violation of this chapter occurred if the owner of such property, agent, employee, contractor, or other party with interest in the property committed the violation. A stop work order issued for violation of the provisions of this chapter shall remain in effect until such time that penalties imposed by the violation have been paid, restoration has been performed, and mitigation has been performed for environmental damage resulting therefrom, to the satisfaction of the Director.

a.    The order shall set forth and contain a description of the nature of the violation.

b.    The stop work order issued under this section shall become effective immediately upon receipt by the person to whom the order is directed.

c.    Failure to comply with the terms of a stop work order can result in enforcement actions including, but not limited to, criminal penalties.

d.    Orders and penalties issued pursuant to this subsection may be appealed as provided for in IMC 18.04.250 through 18.04.260, appeals. (Ord. 2546 § 1, 2008).


18.12.180 City tree fund.

There is hereby created a City tree fund which shall be administered by the Finance Department. All funds received from civil penalties resulting from violations of this chapter shall be deposited in the fund which shall be used only for the purpose of paying all or part of the cost and expense of enforcing and implementing this chapter and may be used for the purpose of acquiring, maintaining, and preserving wooded areas, for planting and maintaining trees on publicly owned property within the City, and for urban forestry education. Monies in said fund not needed for immediate expenditure shall be invested for the benefit of the City tree fund pursuant to RCW 36.29.020.

Chapter 18.14 ANNEXATIONS

Sections:

18.14.010    Purpose and intent.

18.14.020    Annexation process.


18.14.010 Purpose and intent.

The Comprehensive Plan sets forth Potential Annexation Areas (PAAs) to which the City will be expected to provide public services and extend utilities at some time during the twenty (20) year planning period. The Comprehensive Plan also includes a vision for each PAA. Annexation is the process by which the land in the City’s PAAs becomes a part of the City’s jurisdiction. (Ord. 2283 § 1, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 14.1, 1996).


18.14.020 Annexation process.

The annexation process is governed by state law (Chapter 35A.14 RCW). The City’s public process (Level 6 Review – see Chapter 18.04 IMC flow chart) blends with the state process and provides more opportunity for public input. Those annexation proposals, which are deemed by the Planning Director/Manager to be within the vision of the Comprehensive Plan, do not require review by the Planning Policy Commission. 

For those PAAs which would like to pursue annexation prior to a subarea plan being completed by the City, land use designations and other specific planning aspects of the project or area will be determined through a pre-annexation agreement and negotiation process or through the City’s annexation process, remaining consistent with the goals, policies and vision set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 2283 § 1, 2000; Ord. 2108 § 14.2, 1996).

Division I. Transportation Impact Fees

(Recodified as Chapter 3.71 IMC by Ord. 2461)

Division II. Transportation Concurrency Management


18.15.210 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to:

A.    Comply with the State Growth Management Act (GMA) by “prohibiting development approval if the development causes the level-of-service on a transportation facility to decline below the standards adopted in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless transportation improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are made concurrent with the development”; and

B.    Implement the transportation goals and policies adopted in the City’s Comprehensive Plan; and

C.    Support alternative modes of transportation including sidewalks and trails, bicycle lanes and transit; and

D.    Balance the City’s transportation concurrency goals with Policy HS 3.1 – Support quality education by exempting public schools from the requirements of this chapter; and

E.    Implement simplified concurrency that mitigates system-wide project impacts on a system-wide basis, while local project impacts such as to local operations and safety continue to be mitigated through SEPA review. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.220 Definitions.

The following definitions for specific terms and phrases used in this chapter are supplemented by the definitions in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual and the definitions and rules for interpretation established in Chapter 18.02 IMC:

1.    Concurrency: The provision of improvements, strategies and/or financial commitments at the time of development to accommodate the motorized and nonmotorized transportation impacts of development at the adopted level of service.

2.    Concurrency Approval: The official determination by the City that a proposed development will not reduce the vehicle internal trip ends below the number of such trip ends in the trip bank. Transportation concurrency approval is documented in writing by a concurrency certificate.

3.    Concurrency Certificate: The official written statement issued by the City that documents transportation concurrency approval for a specific development at a specific location.

4.    Concurrency Intersections: Intersections of City streets where level of service may be measured for purposes of determining transportation concurrency such as any existing signalized intersection, or intersection that is planned to be signalized in the City’s TIP, and any roundabout intersection. Concurrency intersections are shown in Exhibit L to the ordinance codified in this division.

5.    Director: The Director of the Development Services Department or his/her designee.

6.    Financial Commitment: A binding and enforceable financial obligation from the applicant that is acceptable to the City and provided to the City before building permit issuance.

7.    Impact Fee: The payment of money to the City for a proportional share of the cost of motorized transportation facilities needed to serve new development. Impact fee payment does not ensure that transportation concurrency has been met.

8.    Level of Service (LOS): The relationship between vehicular traffic volumes and roadway intersection capacity, as specified in this chapter.

9.    Modeling: The use of computer models by the City to forecast traffic flow, evaluate intersection impacts, and determine trips in the trip bank. The computer models are dynamic tools; the models are regularly updated (approximately every two (2) to three (3) years) to include trips from concurrent development and planned development, and changes in the City’s street system.

10.    P.M. Peak Hour: The one (1) hour time period between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on a weekday with the highest number of trips on the City’s street system.

11.    Reservation of Capacity: The portion of vehicle internal trip ends in the trip bank that is set aside to accommodate development that has received transportation concurrency approval but is not yet built or occupied or to accommodate the trips from any project failing concurrency in order to allow the applicant up to one hundred twenty (120) days to evaluate the options for achieving concurrency.

12.    Traffic Study: A study that estimates trip generation, identifies traffic demand patterns, evaluates safety, access or other transportation issues and identifies mitigation measures needed to meet engineering standards such as operational and safety standards. A traffic study may be required by the City as part of a complete transportation concurrency application and/or for environmental review.

13.    Transportation Demand Management (TDM): Strategies that decrease single occupancy motor vehicle trips including, but not limited to, transit and ridesharing incentives, flexible working hours, parking management and pedestrian and bicycle enhancements.

14.    Transportation Improvement Program (TIP): The Transportation Improvement Program reflected in the latest transportation concurrency model update.

15.    Trip Bank: The document created and maintained by the City to record the available vehicle internal trip ends, reservation of trips, and the balance of available vehicle internal trip ends following subtraction of vehicle internal trip ends from each concurrency approval.

16.    Trip End: The beginning (origin) and end (destination) of a trip.

17.    Trips: The number of vehicle internal trip ends generated by a land use in the p.m. peak hour as determined by the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, or other authorized source approved by the Director

18.    Trips, Net New: The number of vehicle internal trip ends generated by a new development, change in use, expansion or modification requiring a development permit minus the trips generated by the previous use of the site within the one (1) year immediately prior to the development permit application. No credit shall be given for vehicle internal trip ends from sites/structures that have been vacant for more than one (1) year or for trips from any unpermitted or illegal development. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

*Exhibit A is on file with the Planning Department.


18.15.230 Transportation concurrency certificate required.

Except as provided in IMC 18.15.240, a transportation concurrency certificate is required for any new development, change in use, expansion or other modification or development that requires a development permit. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.240 Exemptions.

A.    Exempt Uses: The following are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

The following developments are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

1.    Low income housing; provided, that the applicant shall record a City-drafted covenant that prohibits using the property for any purpose other than for low income housing. At a minimum, the covenant must address price restrictions and household income limits for the low income housing, and that if the property is converted to a use other than for low income housing, the property owner must pay the applicable impact fees in effect at the time of conversion. Covenants must be recorded with the applicable County Auditor or recording officer. The covenant shall run with the land and apply to subsequent owners and assigns of housing units that receive a low income housing exemption from impact fees.

Any claim or request for an exemption under this section shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. If a building permit is not required for the development, then the claim shall be made when the first development permit is applied for. Any claim not made when required by this section shall be deemed waived.

2.    Buildings or structures constructed by a regional transit authority, pursuant to RCW 82.02.090(1).

3.    City Projects: An applicant proposing the development of a City project shall not be assessed a traffic impact fee.

4.    The reconstruction of a building destroyed by fire, explosion or other accident when the number of trips from the site after reconstruction is equal to or less than the number of trips from the site before the accident.

B.    A change of use to an existing building is not a measurable impact to public facilities and is therefore not subject to impact fees. The expansion of a building is subject to this chapter. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.245 Administration.

A.    Management: The Development Services and Public Works Engineering Departments will coordinate in the administration of the concurrency management system. All final decisions regarding the administration of this chapter shall be the responsibility of the Director.

B.    The City shall determine the available capacity for concurrency as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this division and record it in the trip bank. Up to three hundred (300) trips may occur outside the Central Issaquah Plan boundary as defined by Exhibit 1, Central Issaquah Plan adopted December 17, 2012, Ordinance No. 2663. With each subsequent concurrency application, the City shall update the trip bank by recording the available capacity, reservations of capacity, and the balance of the available capacity that has been adjusted to reflect reserved vehicle internal trip ends.

C.    The City shall update the available capacity in the trip bank within twelve (12) months of the events listed below:

1.    Update or amendment of the City’s Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element as it relates to concurrency management.

2.    More than fifty (50) percent of the available capacity in the most recent calculation of available capacity of the trip bank has been reserved as a result of concurrency certificates issued by the City.

D.    If the events listed in subsection C of this section do not occur within three (3) years of the most recent calculation of the available capacity, the City will update the available capacity recorded in the trip bank.

E.    Each update of available capacity in the trip bank shall carry forward the reservations of capacity for any development permit that has not been completed prior to the update of available capacity.

F.    In order to monitor the cumulative effect of exemptions from the concurrency test on the available capacity, the City shall adjust the available capacity in the trip bank to record the number of trips generated by exempt development permits in the same manner as though a concurrency certificate had been issued for the exempt development permits. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.250 Level of service.

A.    The intersection level of service (LOS) standard in Issaquah shall be LOS D, as defined by the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual.

For transportation concurrency purposes, six (6) concurrency intersections may operate at LOS E or F at any point in time; as long as the weighted average (by traffic volume) Citywide LOS standard for all concurrency intersections is maintained at LOS D. All other concurrency intersections must operate at LOS D or better. The following six (6) intersections may operate at LOS E or F:

1.    NW Sammamish Road/12th Avenue NW/17th Avenue NW/SE 56th Street.

2.    SR 900/I-90 eastbound ramps.

3.    Sunset Way/Front Street.

4.    SE Issaquah Fall City Road/Issaquah Pine Lake Road SE/Highlands Drive NE.

5.    SR 900/NW Talus Drive.

6.    SE Issaquah Fall City Road/SE Black Nugget Road.

B.    The Development Services Director or designee shall maintain a list of concurrency intersections, with the corresponding concurrency LOS assessment, and resultant weighted average Citywide LOS. Concurrency intersections are shown in the Rate Study for Traffic Impact Fees dated December 10, 2014, and Exhibit A to the ordinance codified in this division. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.260 Concurrency review.

A.    Timing and Application: A transportation concurrency application shall be submitted prior to or concurrent with a development application. The concurrency application shall accompany the first development permit application submitted if more than one (1) development permit is required. No development shall be required to obtain more than one (1) concurrency certificate, unless the applicant or subsequent owners propose changes or modifications that require a new development permit application, a future phase of the project requires a concurrency application or the original concurrency certificate has expired.

B.    Review: Transportation concurrency applications, determined complete, shall be reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis.

C.    Trips Evaluated: The transportation concurrency determination shall be based on a review of the net new vehicle internal trip ends generated by the project. Applicants may be required to provide supplemental information regarding the trip generation by the prior use and/or for their specific development if the trip generation is not clearly addressed in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.270 Passing concurrency.

A.    The concurrency application is approved and passes if the number of vehicle internal trip ends from an applicant’s proposed development is equal to or less than available capacity in the trip bank that has been adjusted to subtract reserved vehicle internal trip ends. Additionally, the development type, size, and location must be consistent with the City’s land use forecasts used for concurrency modeling and determination of the trip bank capacity. If the concurrency test is passed, the City shall record the concurrency test results in the trip bank in order to reduce the available capacity by the number of vehicle internal trip ends that will be generated by the applicant’s development.

B.    Reservation of Capacity: The City shall reserve capacity to accommodate the vehicle internal trip ends from any project receiving a concurrency certificate. Reserved capacity shall not be returned to the system unless and until a subsequent development application is denied, rejected, invalidated or abandoned, or the concurrency certificate is no longer valid or expires in accordance with IMC 18.15.290. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.280 Concurrency certificate.

A.    Concurrency Certificate Issuance: A concurrency certificate shall be issued when the net new vehicle internal trip ends from a development do not result in more vehicle internal trip ends than are in the trip bank.

B.    Validity: A concurrency certificate is valid only for the specified uses, densities, intensity and parcel(s) for which it was issued and shall not be transferred to a different project or parcel. A concurrency certificate shall remain valid:

1.    For one (1) year from the date of issuance; three (3) years from issuance for a project that includes transferred development rights; and

2.    During the time the development permit application is under review by the City; and

3.    For the same period of time as the development permit approval. If the development permit does not have an expiration date or an approved phasing schedule that allows a longer build-out, the concurrency certificate shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of development permit approval; and

4.    For a period specified in a negotiated and approved developer’s agreement.

C.    Expiration: A concurrency certificate shall expire if:

1.    A complete development permit application for the project has not been submitted to the Permit Center within one (1) year from the issuance of the concurrency certificate; three (3) years from issuance for a project that includes transferred development rights.

2.    The related development permit application is denied or revoked by the City.

3.    The related development permit expires prior to issuance of a building permit.

D.    Extension: A transportation concurrency certificate may not be extended. A new concurrency certificate is required if the previous certificate has expired.

E.    Subdivision: Trips authorized by the concurrency certificate for a subdivision shall be divided equally among the lots. The Director may modify such assignment upon petition of the owner. Any change of use of one (1) or more of the subdivided parcels shall require a new concurrency determination for the parcel(s) changing use. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.290 Failing concurrency.

A.    Determination: A concurrency certificate shall not be issued when the concurrency review determines that an application’s vehicle internal trip ends exceed the vehicle internal trip ends in the trip bank; or if the proposed land use type, location, or size is not consistent with the City’s land use forecasts used for concurrency modeling and determination of the trip bank capacity. The applicant shall be notified in writing that the project has failed concurrency.

B.    Reservation of Capacity: The City shall reserve capacity to accommodate the trips from any project failing concurrency for sixty (60) days in order to allow the applicant time to evaluate the options for achieving concurrency outlined in subsection D of this section. The sixty (60) day period shall begin with the date of notice that the project failed concurrency. The Director may extend the reservation of capacity for a length of time as determined by the Director when:

1.    The applicant has, within the sixty (60) day reservation of capacity, submitted changes in the project and/or proposed traffic mitigation and paid the application fee for a model run if required to propose adding more vehicle internal trip ends to the trip bank; or

2.    The applicant and City have signed a consultant contract to prepare an EIS for the project; or

3.    The development application is for a Master Site Plan; or

4.    There exist good faith negotiations between the City and applicant toward a development agreement.

C.    Expiration: The reservation of capacity shall expire at the end of sixty (60) days unless a concurrency certificate has been issued or the reservation has been extended as provided for in subsection B of this section.

D.    Options for Development Failing Concurrency: The applicant for a development failing concurrency may:

1.    Abandon the proposed development.

2.    Agree in writing within sixty (60) days of the notification of concurrency failure to:

a.    Build or provide a mitigation strategy, and provide a financial commitment, for the transportation facility improvements necessary to achieve concurrency;

b.    Phase the development to reduce the number of project vehicle internal trip ends to a level that will achieve concurrency; and/or

c.    Modify the concurrency and development permit applications by reducing the size of the development and/or implementing transportation demand management strategies to reduce the number of project trips to a level that will achieve concurrency.

3.    Appeal the concurrency determination to the Hearing Examiner in accordance with IMC 18.15.320.

4.    Proceed with permitting the project as proposed even though the development application(s) must be denied if the project failed to receive a concurrency certificate.

E.    Mitigation Criteria: The mitigation options established in subsection (D)(2) of this section shall be consistent with the following criteria:

1.    Transportation Facility Improvements:

a.    Administrative Approval: The Director may approve transportation facility improvements that add additional vehicle internal trip ends to the trip bank to achieve concurrency when all of the following criteria are met:

(1)    The improvement is consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan and is added to the City’s adopted Transportation Improvement Program;

(2)    The timing of the improvement is completed within six (6) years;

(3)    If the trip bank update is not planned, then the applicant shall pay all costs associated with updating the trip bank, including but not limited to consultant costs to run the concurrency model to measure whether the proposed improvements meet the Citywide LOS standards, to recalculate vehicle internal trip ends in the trip bank, and complete any other tasks identified by the Director.

b.    City Council Approval: The City Council may approve a transportation facility improvement not included in the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) as transportation concurrency mitigation by amending the TIP to include the proposed improvement.

c.    Funding Commitment and Conditions: The permit for any development requiring one (1) or more transportation facility improvements in order to achieve concurrency shall include conditions requiring a financial commitment by the applicant, binding on subsequent owners, for the completion of the improvement(s). The cost of the transportation improvement(s) required for concurrency may be credited towards the developer’s transportation impact fee obligation in accordance with IMC 3.71.050(E).

d.    Latecomer Agreements: The City may authorize latecomer agreements, or other reimbursement from owners of property benefited by the concurrency improvements, as allowed by State law.

2.    Transportation Demand Management (TDM)/Phasing: The Director may approve a TDM strategy or phasing plan that achieves transportation concurrency when the TDM strategy or phasing plan includes:

a.    An implementation plan and schedule;

b.    Methods to monitor and enforce TDM/phasing performance;

c.    A fallback plan to achieve concurrency if the TDM goals are not achieved within two (2) years of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The TDM strategy/phasing plan shall be a condition of development approval and shall apply to all future property owners. The Director shall determine, consistent with accepted engineering practice, the appropriate trip reduction resulting from the proposed TDM strategy. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.300 Relationship to the State Environmental Policy Act.

This chapter establishes the minimum transportation concurrency requirements applicable to all development and is not intended to limit the City’s authority under the State Environment Policy Act (SEPA) or to evaluate all transportation impacts resulting from new development, particularly safety and operational impacts. SEPA mitigation regarding intersection operation and/or safety may be included as conditions of the concurrency certificate at the discretion of the Director. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.310 Fees.

The City shall charge a processing fee to any individual or entity that applies for a transportation concurrency certificate, except governmental entities. The fee shall be nonrefundable and nonassignable to any other fees or development. Such fees shall be determined by resolution of the City Council. An additional fee will be required if, in the sole judgment of the Director, use of the City’s transportation computer forecasting model is necessary for making a concurrency determination. All concurrency processing fees shall be paid in full upon application for a concurrency determination. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


18.15.320 Appeals.

Refer to IMC 18.04.250 to 18.04.260 regarding appeals. (Ord. 2733 § 5 (Exh. I), 2015; Ord. 2595 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Introduction


18.19B.010 Purpose.

The purpose of these standards is to provide replacement regulations for sunsetted development agreements for various Urban Villages within the City, inspiring an animated and connected urban community where pedestrians are priority, requiring buildings and open space that are openly interrelated, designing sites that make a positive contribution to the public realm, attracting and retaining businesses that complement each Urban Village’s vision, and, ultimately, creating a place where people of all income levels and diversities are drawn to live, work and play. These standards promote the construction of developments that will have an appealing and visually engaging public realm in order to encourage social interaction, outdoor activity and a pedestrian orientation in a sustainable, compact, mixed use area. More specifically for each Urban Village: The replacement regulations for Issaquah Highlands are committed to retaining a distinct neighborhood in Issaquah that possesses a strong sense of community, is progressive in its design, and will be a place where people live, work and play in a pedestrian-friendly environment surrounded and enhanced by acres of preserved open space. This idea incorporates and updates the amenities prevalent in a nineteenth or early twentieth century town with the intent of reviving the close-knit spirit of traditional villages and communities including: narrow streets in a comprehensible layout; a comfortable sense of community; an eclectic mix of housing; a plan that encourages walking; a mixed use village area; buildings on small lots that comfortably enclose the street; common open space and community focal points; and consideration of how all the elements of a neighborhood come together to shape it. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.020 Intent.

The intent of the goals, guidelines, development and design standards of the replacement regulations is to generally maintain the current character and land use relationships of Issaquah Highlands; achieve compatible land uses within zoning districts and surrounding areas by providing uniform regulations throughout each district; encouraging neighborhood stability and consistency; promoting commercial viability and compatibility; and retaining Issaquah Highlands’ distinct character within the historic design and scale of Issaquah. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.030 Scope and applicability.

A.    This chapter contains goals, guidelines, and standards applicable to certain Urban Village districts, projects, and properties following the sunset of the development agreements that guided their development. The Urban Villages whose development agreements have currently been terminated and are now regulated by these replacement regulations are: Issaquah Highlands, TOD, and WSDOT (exclusive of the parcel commonly known as the Bellevue College property (Parcel 262406-9041)). The following standards and procedures apply to properties previously entitled through development agreements as specifically listed in this section. For any development provisions (e.g., stormwater standards, critical area regulations, tree retention, signage, etc.) not specifically listed in this chapter, standard provisions of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Central Issaquah Area Development and Design Standards) (CIDDS) apply, except for CIDDS tree regulations 10.10 through 10.14; instead Urban Villages covered by these replacement regulations shall use tree regulations in Chapter 18.12 IMC (IMC 18.12.1370 through 18.12.1390). To the extent that this chapter and Chapter 18.19A IMC do not establish applicable development and design standards, process, procedures, or other elements covering a certain subject, element or condition, development shall be governed by the Issaquah Municipal Code and other City codes.

B.    The following rules shall apply to facilitate the use of Chapter 18.19A IMC, Central Issaquah Development and Design Standards (CIDDS), with this chapter, Issaquah Highlands replacement regulations. 

1.    Chapter 18.19A IMC excludes Urban Villages covered by development agreements; however, since the Urban Villages covered by this chapter are no longer regulated by development agreements, Chapter 18.19A IMC will apply to them to the extent provided in subsection A of this section.

2.    Where language in Chapter 18.19A IMC refers to “Central Issaquah” as a geographic place, it shall mean “Issaquah Highlands.”

3.    Where language in Chapter 18.19A IMC refers to “Central Issaquah vision” or “Central Issaquah Plan,” it shall be deemed to mean “Issaquah Highlands vision, goals, and guidelines (as appropriate)” when applied to properties governed by this chapter. The Issaquah Highlands vision, goals, and guidelines are located in Attachments 1 and 2 to this chapter.

4.    Where language in Chapter 18.19A IMC refers to “Development and Design Standards,” it shall include “or Issaquah Highlands Replacement Regulations, as appropriate” when applied to properties governed by this chapter.

5.    Section 1.1.E.2, Scope, in Chapter 18.19A IMC, as applied to Issaquah Highlands, shall be interpreted to read: “No administrative adjustment may be made for standards or requirements listed below, except as otherwise permitted by this code or 18.19B, where applicable:”

6.    In Table 4.3A, Levels of Review, in Chapter 18.19A IMC, the Urban Villages regulated by this chapter follow those for “Village Residential, Mixed Use Residential, Destination Retail and Mixed Use, …” IMC 18.19B.270, Processing of applications including adjustments and modifications of standards, establishes additional thresholds for levels of review for Issaquah Highlands.

7.    Central Issaquah Figures 6A and 7A and 7B do not apply to the Issaquah Highlands. For standards in Chapter 18.19A IMC which reference Figure 6A to determine the location or applicable standard of circulation facilities, existing Issaquah Highlands circulation facilities, existing or anticipated circulation demand, and block lengths, as required by Chapter 18.19A IMC, shall substitute for Figure 6A. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.040 Interpretations and conflicts.

Unless specifically identified otherwise, the Director is authorized to interpret this Code, acting on the City’s initiative, or in response to an inquiry. The purpose of interpretations is to clarify the Code responsibilities, rules, procedures, and requirements, including resolving conflicting or silent text, determining unidentified uses, etc. The vision, goals, and policies within the Issaquah Highlands replacement regulations are fixed; methods to implement can be flexible. Anyone may request an interpretation of this Code by filing a written request with the Permit Center. The Director shall respond, in writing, to all requests for formal interpretation. Clarifying language of one interpretation of this Code may be used for another interpretation of this Code. If any conflict arises between this Code and another rule, regulation, resolution, ordinance or statute which has been lawfully adopted by the City, the provision that best implements the general or specific Issaquah Highlands goals and policies shall apply, as determined by the Director. Requests for interpretations will be available to the public, on the City’s website. The Director will not act on the requested interpretation for ten (10) days following its posting on the City’s webpage. Interpretations, once issued, may be appealed to the Hearing Examiner following procedures in this title. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.050 Definitions.

The following terms, as used in this chapter, are defined below. Where definitions are not provided below, Chapter 18.19A IMC applies. If definitions are not provided in either Chapter 18.19A IMC or this chapter, then the definitions in Chapter 18.02 IMC apply as established above in IMC 18.19B.030:

Assisted living: “Assisted living,” for the purposes of allowed uses in these regulations, is any of a variety of senior care facilities that provides either permanent or temporary residence for senior citizens. These facilities must provide on-site services for residents such as common dining areas (although some facilities may offer kitchen facilities in the individual rooms), health services, such as a resident nurse. An assisted living facility is not senior housing, independent living, retirement community, adult family home or residential care facility. It may include convalescent home, skilled nursing, hospital.

Hillside and sloped sites: Sites or portions of sites that rise at an inclination of twelve (12) percent or more within a vertical elevation change of at least ten (10) feet. 

Issaquah Highlands: Within this chapter, the use of the term “Issaquah Highlands” means the properties within the projects regulated by the terminated development agreements for Issaquah Highlands, TOD, and WSDOT TDR exclusive of the parcel commonly known as the Bellevue College property (Parcel 262406-9041) to which the WSDOT TDR applies until such time as it is terminated.

Natural grade: Existing grade of the site as of the adoption of the Design Manual, excluding temporary features such as stormwater or TESC ponds and stockpiles of soil. 

Neighborhood serving retail: Retail which provides for the sale of goods and personal services for the day-to-day living needs of the neighborhood, as opposed to regional retail focused on drawing, and even requiring, regional customers.

Overlay: Superimposed over conventional zoning districts, it consists of a physical area with mapped boundaries and provides additional zoning information specific to that property, such as zoning cap.

Park: An element of the public realm that is outdoor, open gathering place that is designed for public access to open air spaces, for social and recreational purposes. Recreation can accommodate passive and/or active uses. The park may contain a variety of design treatments, including both soft and hard surfaces, though more landscape areas and lawn than hardscape. Modest structures such as gazebos are allowed. Parks are located in commercial and residential neighborhoods, and fulfill a wide variety of purposes, serving people of various age groups and abilities.

Retaining wall: Walls whose primary purpose is retaining soil and/or a cut or fill slope. 

Senior housing: An establishment providing residence for retired persons who are not in need of medical or nursing treatment except in the case of temporary illness. Senior housing may also be called independent living or a retirement community. “Senior housing” does not include assisted living, nursing, convalescent, hospitals, or sanitariums.

Site walls: Walls that may or may not retain soil, and which may be also used for fall protection, delineation of space, substitute streetwall, etc. Retaining walls are a subset of site walls. 

Sociable public realm: See Chapter 18.19A IMC, definition for “Public Realm.”

Urban Village: The Urban Villages were established to encourage innovative uses, sites and comprehensive planning of large land parcels. Master planning and development of larger parcels provide the opportunity for reasonably priced housing, enhanced public services and concurrency, infrastructure solutions and improvements, and allow creative land development through clustering, permanent preservation of wetlands and other natural areas, integration of recreational facilities and phasing of infrastructure. 

(Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).

18.19B.120 Homeowner’s or Commercial Association Architectural Review Committee (ARC).

Prior to submittal for any permit, a property owner or agent with authority to act for a property owner must demonstrate that they have either obtained ARC approval for those permits where the ARC has purview; or they must demonstrate that the ARC is inactive to the satisfaction of the Director. The Architecture and Urban Design Manual located in Chapter 18 of Chapter 18.19A IMC does not apply within Issaquah Highlands. Its functions are performed by the ARC if and until such time as the ARC is determined to be inactive. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.130 Zoning districts and permitted land uses.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of zoning and land uses is to protect public health, safety and general welfare by implementing the goals and policies adopted in the Issaquah Comprehensive Plan; the Principles, Goals, and Commitments of Issaquah Highlands; and the Issaquah Highlands Urban Design Guidelines. The intent of the zoning and land uses is to:

1.    Maintain the established character of Issaquah Highlands without preventing its growth, completion, and vitality.

2.    Retain and pursue a balanced mix of land uses that achieve the live/work/play vision.

3.    Preserving and establishing pedestrian- and bike-oriented transportation, while maintaining the functional needs of the automobile. 

B.    Zoning and Overlay Created: Property zoning is established by designation on an adopted map; and, through a specific overlay. The “zoning” layer identifies the land use that is approved for every property that previously was covered by the development agreement. The overlay identifies the zoning cap (i.e., square footage and/or number of residential units) that can be accommodated on the property, exclusive of any bonus density (e.g., transferred development rights), if and where allowed.

18.19B.140 District standards. 

A.    Building Heights and Setbacks: The following applies to all properties. See Figure 2 for locations: 

	Zone	Bldg Height4	Lot Size	Setbacks3

	Front	Rear	Side

	UV-SF	 45 feet	No limitation	0 feet	4 feet1	4 feet1

	UV-MF	 60 feet	0 feet	5 feet2	5 feet2

	UV-COM/RET	Commercial Uses: 85 feet	0 feet	20 feet2	10 feet2

	UV-MUR	 85 feet	0 feet	20 feet2	10 feet2

	CF-FPO 	 35 feet	0 feet	20 feet2	10 feet2

1     Body of building must meet setback shown; architectural elements may be three (3) feet from property line except adjacent to an alley where a four (4) foot setback must be maintained. No setback is required for attached structures.

2     Setback only required when adjacent to single family detached residential use. 

3     Note the Architectural Review Committee may apply more restrictive setbacks than the City.

4    Minimum first floor height is fifteen (15) feet in mixed use nonresidential or mixed use residential buildings. 

B.    Impervious Surfaces: Each property, parcel, tract, etc., may have up to one hundred (100) percent impervious surface as allowed by current stormwater standards in the City; however, the Architectural Review Committee, Urban Design Guidelines, and other standards may result in less than one hundred (100) percent impervious surface being allowed.

C.    Floor Area Ratio (F.A.R.): A minimum FAR of 1.0 is required for nonresidential development or redevelopment. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.150 Coal mine hazard standards.

Requirements to meet “Coal Mine Mitigation zones, Exhibit 3 (Southern Area Coal Mine Standards)” and AM00-015IH (dated April 19, 2001) are now found in Chapter 18.10 IMC (critical area regulations, mine hazard areas). (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.200 Hillside sites. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: Development in Issaquah Highlands should strengthen existing assets, including hillsides. These sites are essential components to the character of Issaquah and views the community cherishes. Development must respect the topographic character of each site through building design and siting, and minimizing the height of retaining walls, with the intention of blending into the native environment and retaining existing trees. For sites which include hillsides, development will minimize disturbance to the hillside, respond to the natural grade, and provide visual mitigations such as terraced walls and revegetation on disturbed areas.

B.    Standards:

1.    Projects on sites or portions of sites equal to or greater than fifteen (15) percent (minimum vertical elevation change of at least fifteen (15) feet) shall step the building foundations, building rooflines, and bench or terrace site cuts or fills resulting in buildings (foundations and overall massing) that follow the natural grade. 

2.    For uphill sites, only use maximum building height and do not use average grade or averaging of building heights, for the purpose of minimizing the visual impact of the building.

3.    Exposed cuts and fills shall be minimized, and final grading recontoured and landscaped to blend into the site and appear natural. To achieve that, no changes to the natural grades (cut or fill) may be more than fifteen (15) feet.

4.    Regardless of the site’s character, retaining walls on the site shall be no taller than ten (10) feet, with trees (thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet o.c.) and shrubs planted in front of the wall. If taller walls are required, walls shall be terraced with enough space between walls to comfortably accommodate shrubs, vines, and ground cover, and, if the wall design accommodates it, trees. Landscape’s purpose is to soften the visual impact of walls and blend them into their setting.

5.    Buildings placed in hillside areas must be designed to blend with the surrounding hillside using colors and articulation, which are consistent with the balance of the building. Select building materials and colors to reduce the visual impact of the building.

6.    All walls will be articulated and receive architectural treatment if they are visible, including the downhill portions of the building. In addition to architectural treatment of the visible portions of foundations and lower building walls, landscape screening is also necessary.

7.    Straight, engineered, unnatural appearing slopes, walls, and/or landscape are not allowed. These must blend with the surroundings, including natural open space when present.

8.    Buildings shall not interrupt natural ridgelines.

9.    The following graphic conceptually illustrates for uphill sites how buildings, foundations, and site cuts would follow the natural grade:
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.210 Site walls. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: Site walls may be necessary or desirable even on flat sites. Where they are used they must be factored into creating a public realm that is pedestrian friendly and engaging, through material selection, placement, height, etc. Some wall styles are appropriate in or adjacent to natural open spaces, while other styles are suited to the built environment. Where walls are necessary or desirable, use walls that contribute to the selected architectural style and positively add to the public realm.

B.    Standards:

1.    Site walls adjacent to pedestrian areas (e.g., walkways, sidewalks, trails) shall be no taller than four (4) feet in height. If taller walls are required, e.g., as a retaining wall, two (2) choices are available:

a.    Up to four (4) foot tall wall next to or near the pedestrian area, with taller walls (up to ten (10) feet in height) terraced behind the lower wall.

b.    Up to ten (10) foot tall wall set back from the pedestrian area with enough setback to accommodate evergreen trees spaced every thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet. Additional walls may be terraced behind the first wall. Setback must accommodate mature tree size without impinging on pedestrian area. Setback space between trees will be filled with shrubs and ground covers consistent with CIDDS landscape standards.

c.    In all cases of terracing, walls shall be terraced with enough space between walls to comfortably accommodate shrubs, vines, and ground cover, and, if the wall design accommodates it, trees, to soften the visual impact of walls and blend them into their setting. 

2.    Wall materials shall complement the selected architectural styles, such as block or shotcrete covered soil nail walls. Wall materials shall not distract from the overall composition and the selected architectural style. Tri-plane faced block is an example of a distracting and busy wall material. 

3.    Materials shall be scored or changed at a pedestrian scale frequency. Pedestrian scale materials include brick and other block or modular element. If concrete is used, it shall be treated architecturally with scoring or other detailing, at a human scaled frequency.

4.    Walls up to four (4) feet in height and longer than thirty-five (35) feet in length will be articulated and modulated, at a frequency of, at a minimum, thirty-five (35) feet.

5.    Rockeries or timber walls may not be used except when adjacent to natural open spaces. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.220 Parks and plazas. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of this section is to encourage a variety of gathering and recreational opportunities through the inclusion of parks and plazas in Issaquah Highlands. It is expected that good design principles will be applied to all spaces, including:

1.    Create gathering and recreational opportunities that are visually inviting to users.

2.    Provide enjoyable places to sit, walk, gather or play.

3.    Achieve the desired community functions.

4.    Encourage variety and interest within the urban environment.

5.    Ensure visual and functional continuity.

6.    Provide for comfort and safety.

7.    Emphasize quality.

8.    Promote the wise and efficient use of natural resources.

B.    Parks Provisions and Locations:

1.    Within Issaquah Highlands, existing parks shall be retained as open space. Park locations are shown on Figure 3, map and chart. Removal or reduction of any existing park shown or listed on Figure 3, or required by subsection (D)(1) of this section, must be approved through a Council modification process as outlined in IMC 18.19B.270 (adjustment and modification of standards). 

2.    Required park facilities, as established by the Issaquah Highlands Parks Plan (October 19, 2001), shall be retained, unless a Level 2 administrative adjustment of standards is approved substituting an equivalent activity; or as otherwise approved by the City Council. The following list summarizes the facilities required by the Issaquah Highlands Parks Plan:

C.    General Standards: The following general requirements shall apply to parks, plazas, and informal gathering areas. Any outside resources referenced in these standards (e.g., ASTM, ISA standards, or ANSI) shall use the most recent version; or the Director may substitute a more current and equivalent code or resource in consultation with the Parks Director and best practices.

1.    Views and linkages to streets and other public spaces and buildings shall be respected and reinforced through site planning and/or design elements.

2.    Children’s play areas and activities should be located away from streets on which the road design speed exceeds thirty-five (35) miles per hour. Children’s play areas and activities located within a facility that is adjacent to a street shall consider measures (e.g., hedges and fences) necessary to protect children’s safety.

3.    Where possible, summer shade areas should be incorporated when providing children’s play areas. Shading may be accomplished by deciduous landscaping, architectural elements, temporary structures, or other means.

4.    All play areas and structures shall conform to the requirements noted in the current editions of publication F1487 “Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specifications for Playground Equipment for Public Use,” published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and “The Handbook for Public Playground Safety,” published by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission.

13.    Bollards or other devices shall be used for limited controlled vehicular access and where appropriate for emergency and maintenance access.

14.    Plans shall conform to any applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 

15.    Perimeter plantings shall be compatible with the style of adjacent landscaping.

16.    Native, drought tolerant, or plant materials supportive of urban wildlife habitat shall be used where appropriate.

17.    Continued maintenance and selective pruning and removal of vegetation which may be hazardous to the safety, visibility, and clearances of pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles. All pruning shall be done in accordance with the International Society of Arboriculture Standards as amended. Topping (the severe reduction of branches without consideration of the specifications for cutting back) of trees is prohibited. 

18.    All fertilizer and pesticide applications shall conform to the City standards. Fertilizer and pesticide applications shall be made in a manner that will inhibit their entry into waterways, wetlands and storm drains.

19.    All plants shall be adapted to their sites (sun exposure, cold hardiness, hydrozones, soil type, soil pH, etc.). Plants with differing environmental/cultural requirements shall not be used together if desirable circumstances cannot be provided for both. New plant materials shall consist of native or drought tolerant varieties or nonnative species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of the Greater Issaquah area and in conformance with Chapters 10 and 16 of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Landscape Development and Design Standards).

a.    Incorporate water and nutrient holding materials into the soil as deep as possible. Use fully composted organic material.

b.    Mulch new planting areas to minimize evaporation, reduce weed growth and slow erosion. Use fully composted material.

c.    Feather all mulches used in planter beds to the base of the plants.

d.    Water tubes should also be added to the tree plantings to allow water to penetrate the soil.

D.    Parks – Net New Development:

1.    With net new residential development, new parks will be provided at the minimum rate of two hundred fifty (250) square feet per residential unit. The requirement only applies to “net new” units. That is new dwelling units constructed, above and beyond those in place upon effective date of this code or those dwelling units whose land use permits are vested by a separate development agreement or per IMC 18.19B.280. To meet the requirement, the parks must have the following characteristics:

a.    Parks will comply with the applicable Issaquah Highlands goal and guideline documents.

b.    The park space must be provided on site. For multifamily projects this means as part of the parcel. For single family plats, parks would be an integral part of the plat, though potentially on a separate tract or parcel.

c.    The park shall have visual and recreation variety pedestrian amenities, and appeal to the senses. It will engage all age groups through elements such as seating, lighting, water features, special paving, landscaping, artwork and special recreational features. It will provide both sun and shade.

d.    Locational characteristics: away from surface parking lots, loading/waste collection/service areas. The land shall be configured to be useable, pleasant, and an integral component of the project or plat in which it is located. It will not be located on “leftover” property or in locations that are isolated or hidden which might create security or perceived safety concerns.

e.    The park should have an access easement.

E.    Plazas: Plazas are outdoor open gathering places which are primarily hard surface, but which may contain landscaping. They denote important places, create a focus, and/or increase light and air at street level. They also function as points of orientation. They may be located adjacent to buildings, within a park or other open space, or independent. The following general requirements shall apply to plazas in Issaquah Highlands. See IMC 18.19B.220 for specific Issaquah Highlands plaza standards:

1.    Plazas may be constructed with concrete, pavers, or special paving material. Asphalt is not permitted.

2.    Root barriers shall be provided for all trees planted within plazas.

3.    Seating must be provided. The seating may be fixed or moveable, or a combination of both. Required seating may be provided by ledges, fountains, sculptures, benches, chairs, stairs, etc. At least two (2) of the seats shall meet ADA standards. For purposes of determining the number of seats provided on a bench, ledge, fountain, etc., eighteen (18) lineal inches on a horizontal surface is considered one (1) seat.

4.    The spacing, location and type of required street trees may be modified when adjacent to a plaza.

5.    A portion of a plaza may be used for reserved seating for restaurants or other uses.

6.    Permanent structures may be provided within a plaza provided they do not preclude use of and access to the plaza by the general public. Structures may be enclosed or open air and may be leased for commercial use.

7.    Physical obstructions between a plaza and a sidewalk or public park shall be designed to provide sufficient visibility to protect the public safety of the users of the plaza and to ensure that public access to the plaza is convenient, obvious and welcoming. No walls or structures shall exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height above the abutting sidewalk or public park for a total of more than fifty (50) percent of the lineal footage along one (1) side of a plaza that directly abuts a public street right-of-way or public park.

F.    Plazas with New Development: At a minimum, new plazas will be provided at the rate of twenty-five (25) square feet per one thousand (1,000) square feet of new nonresidential construction, except new public school facilities. The plaza shall be provided on site. It may be broken into multiple spaces; however, when multiple plazas are selected no plaza which counts to the requirement may be smaller than two thousand (2,000) square feet in size. Plazas shall be located to serve both the site’s users and the public. 

G.    Park or Plaza Relocation: Where a parcel is being redeveloped and Figures 3 and/or 4 show an existing park or required plaza being identified on that property, the applicant may propose to relocate the park or plaza with the same or better square footage, functional equivalence, and sense of public access without requiring Council approval. Approval shall occur with the required land use and construction permits. 

H.    Figure 4 identifies the required Town Center plazas, which shall be retained. Removal or reduction of any of the plazas shown or listed on Figure 4 must be approved through a Council modification process as outlined in IMC 18.19B.270. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.230 Trails. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of this section is to encourage a variety of experiences through public and private trail systems, on which no motorized vehicles are permitted. Minimum requirements and standards are established to promote safety, incorporate maintenance considerations, identify infrastructure requirements, and reduce the impact of development on the environment. It is expected that good design principles will be applied at all times, including:

1.    Safety and accessibility to trail users;

2.    Well-built trails, constructed in a manner appropriate to their use, users, and location;

3.    Environmental stewardship; and

4.    Well-planned connections between properties, open spaces, and to the identified regional trails of Issaquah Highlands.

B.    General Standards: The following requirements apply to all trail types. Any outside resources referenced in these standards (e.g., ISA standards, or ANSI), shall use the most recent version; or the Director may substitute a more current and equivalent code or resource in consultation with the Parks Director and best practices:

1.    Adequate drainage shall be provided.

2.    Locate trails to minimize construction impacts on critical areas. Trail corridors may meander to avoid impacts to critical areas and to correspond with topographical conditions.

3.    Nonmotorized circulation shall be located in areas with minimum slopes, where possible, to provide access to people of various age groups and abilities. Where slopes cannot be avoided, nonmotorized surfaces up to twelve (12) percent may use soft surfaces where that surface type is allowed by subsection C of this section. Slopes between twelve (12) percent and fifteen (15) percent must be hard or stabilized surfaces appropriate for the trail type (e.g., hard surfaces may not be used in critical areas). Where slopes are twelve (12) percent or greater, stairs may be required. Where steps are used, there must be a minimum of two (2) steps, and they must be generally level. Also where stairs are appropriate or necessary, bike rails may be required.

4.    Border plantings shall be compatible with adjacent landscaping in terms of irrigation, maintenance and style.

5.    Trails that will be maintained by the City shall contain low maintenance border plantings.

6.    Incorporate the use of native, drought tolerant, or landscape material supportive of urban habitat, where appropriate.

7.    If used, design and locate pedestrian lighting to minimize impacts to abutting uses or critical area habitats.

8.    The incorporation of rest stop facilities (benches and trash receptacles) should be provided, where appropriate.

9.    Bollards or other devices for controlling vehicular access at street connections and other appropriate locations shall be provided for emergency and maintenance access.

10.    Trails shall be maintained so as to minimize vegetation that may be hazardous to the safety, visibility, and clearances of trail users. All pruning shall be done in accordance with the most recently adopted version of the International Society of Arboriculture Standards and consistent with Chapters 10 and 16 of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Landscape Development and Design Standards). Tree topping (the severe reduction of branches without consideration of the pruning specifications) is prohibited.

11.    Trails shall be located to minimize light and noise impacts on neighboring residential uses.

12.    Trails shall be located in areas with minimum slopes, where possible, to provide recreational access to people of various age groups and abilities.

13.    Provide signage or other indicators for trail user safety at intersections with streets.

14.    Landscape planting or buffers required by trail standards may be used to meet the trail border requirements.

15.    No fences are allowed within a trail corridor.

16.    Trail borders shall be maintained to provide safe trailside and head clearances.

17.    Where appropriate, the trail tread should be comprised of a structural base to support bicycle use on soft surface trails.

18.    Trails located within critical areas shall comply with the standards set forth in Chapter 18.10 IMC (critical area regulations).

19.    The following trails are allowed in critical areas: multi-purpose (critical areas), neighborhood trail, and forest path. All other trail types are prohibited.

20.    Signs indicating permitted uses shall be placed at every trail entrance. Trail signs shall conform to a design approved by the City of Issaquah in conformance with Chapter 9 of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Sign Standards) and Chapter 18.10 IMC (critical area regulations).

21.    Corridors shall allow for adequate sight distances, based on uses and locations.

22.    Signs requiring bicyclists to dismount on boardwalk portions of trails shall be posted.

1     Trail widths and trail corridors may be increased upon request by the applicant and approval by the Director.

2    “Border” means a planting area adjacent to the trail shoulder or trail. Borders may coincide with required landscaped buffers or landscape on adjacent property. Borders shall be measured from the outside edge of the trail tread, except for multi-purpose trails that shall be measured from the outside edge of the shoulders. 

3    Mineral soils will be used when they are present; crushed rock will be used if mineral soils and/or structural base cannot be established and following best practices. Crushed rock may not be used within twenty (20) feet of right-of-way.

4    Secondary uses or unlisted nonmotorized uses are permitted when the trail can be designed to make the secondary uses compatible, safe, and acceptable with pedestrian activity. Secondary users may encounter segments of a trail which will require caution or a detour due to specific trail tread surfacing. The Director must approve changes to the list of primary or secondary users.

5    Bicyclists must dismount on boardwalks.

6    For critical areas and surface water management facilities only.

7     Borders may be reduced to three (3) feet when low shrubs and ground cover are used. In the case of three (3) foot borders, the trail corridor will be reduced to ten (10) feet.

8    All weather surface required.

D.    Description of Trails for Use in Issaquah Highlands:

1.    Trails will retain the designation (trail type) under which they were reviewed and constructed. If it is unclear which trail standard was used, the Director will make a determination based on the closest description below and dimensions and/or materials above. 

2.    Description of Trails:

a.    Multi-Purpose Trail: Multi-purpose trails are high-use paved trails designed to provide recreational opportunities for pedestrians and nonmotorized wheel users. Multi-purpose trails are intended to provide or connect with community-wide or regional routes for pedestrians and nonmotorized wheel users. They should be located to link major community facilities, recreational complexes, schools, other multi-purpose trails, and major transportation access points to community-wide or regional routes.

b.    Multi-Purpose Trail (Critical Areas): Multi-purpose trails through critical areas are soft surface trails intended to provide flexibility when a multi-purpose trail moves through a critical area. They provide pedestrian and bicycle movement through critical areas with minimal disturbance.

c.    Neighborhood Trail: Neighborhood trails are hard or soft surface trails designed to provide recreational opportunities for pedestrians. They are intended to provide connections between neighborhoods or between neighborhoods and community land uses and to interconnect sidewalk systems. Typically, neighborhood trails should be located in or adjacent to neighborhoods, open spaces or critical areas.

d.    Forest Path: Forest paths are narrow, soft-surface, low impact trails that meander through critical areas, critical area buffers and forested areas with existing vegetation. Forest paths are constructed, pursuant to U.S. Forest Service Standards, to minimize impacts and to adapt to existing conditions such as steep slopes and heavily vegetated areas. Forest paths are low usage trails that provide an environmental and recreational experience. Additionally, where these trails traverse areas subject to frequent inundation from water, a boardwalk-type tread may be used to enable pedestrian passage. The intent of the forest path is to provide pedestrians connections through forested areas (such as uneven surfaces, steeper grades, rocks, etc.).

e.    Feature Pedestrian Way: Feature pedestrian ways are hard surface promenades connecting major community focal points. They may include a mixture of stairs, ramps and walkways. Feature pedestrian ways provide direct visual and physical access from neighborhoods to major community event locations or between major community focal points. Feature pedestrian ways will conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as required by ADA specifications.

f.    Feature Pedestrian Way (Hardscape or Container Plantings Border): Feature pedestrian ways (hardscape or container plantings border) are hard surface promenades connecting major community focal points. They may be used when a feature pedestrian way corridor abuts a mixed use, retail or commercial use. When a feature pedestrian way corridor abuts a mixed use, retail or commercial use, hardscape or container plantings may replace the planted border requirement. Hardscape includes, but is not limited to, paving materials, fountains, sculpture or art. Feature pedestrian ways (hardscape or container plantings border) will conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as required by ADA specifications.

g.    Combined Use Trail: Combined use trails are designed to provide recreational opportunities for pedestrians on maintenance vehicle access roads, especially those associated with water quality systems. They are intended to provide a recreational trail experience in and around open space areas. The route of the trail may meander within the width of the road.

h.    Neighborhood Walk: Neighborhood walks are short, small-scale paved walks designed to provide recreational opportunities for residents or others in the area which the neighborhood walk serves. Typically, they should provide walking route alternatives to sidewalks within the area served or provide a relatively “secret” connection between the sidewalk system in an area and a neighborhood or community-wide trail. For example, a neighborhood walk may be used to connect two cul-de-sacs or provide a midblock shortcut.

E.    Existing Trails:

1.    All trails in existence in Issaquah Highlands upon the date of adoption of these standards shall be retained. Removal or reduction of an existing trail must be approved through a Council modification process as outlined in IMC 18.19B.270. 

2.    Where a parcel is being redeveloped and a previous land use permit shows an existing trail on that property, the applicant may propose to relocate the trail with the same or better classification, connectivity, and sense of public access without requiring Council approval. Approval shall occur with the required land use and construction permits. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.240 Single family and townhouse standards.

A.    Applicability and Purpose: The single family and townhouse standards are for use with residences in the UV-SF zone. The purpose is to retain the design and development standards used in building Issaquah Highlands and which created residential streetscapes that emphasized people, pedestrians, and homes while reducing the impact of the automobile and garage on them.

B.    Design and Development Standards:

1.    Unit Orientation: The front door of the unit will face the street or public pedestrian route, and will have a prominent presence from the street through its placement, orientation, architectural elements, and proportions. Each unit will have a pedestrian walkway between the public pedestrian route and the front door, separate from the driveway. There may also be a pedestrian connection from the driveway to the front door or front walk.

2.    Parking and Driveways:

a.    Single Family Driveway Dimensions:

(1)    Each lot with driveway access from a street, woonerf, or similar facility except an alley shall provide a driveway which has an eighteen (18) foot minimum length and maximum driveway width of twenty (20) feet. Where driveway parking is not needed or possible, driveways shall be limited to eight (8) feet or less in length, and use other techniques which communicate that parking on the driveway apron is prohibited.

(2)    Where lots are narrower than forty (40) feet, the driveway cut within the right-of-way may not be wider than sixteen (16) feet plus two (2) foot wings. 

(3)    Where a wider driveway is functionally necessary (such as to serve a three (3) car garage), use landscape or other elements acceptable to the Director to break the driveway into sections, each twenty (20) feet or less in width. See example below. 
[IMAGE]


(4)    Where a lot has alley access, all vehicular access to the lot must be from the alley. Driveways from alleys must have an eighteen (18) foot minimum length where parking is desired, and shall be limited to four (4) feet or less in length where parking is prohibited.

(5)    A lot may have one (1) driveway cut from a street or other circulation facility with a pedestrian component, unless the driveway forms a “U” in which case two (2) driveway cuts are allowed. 

(6)    Lots on NE Harrison Street, NE Harrison Drive, Harrison Court NE, and Harrison Way NE may choose to provide an autocourt instead of driveway if all of the following criteria are met; however, all other single family garage requirements must be met including the house in front of the garage and a maximum twenty (20) foot curb cut and vehicular drive to access the autocourt: 

(A)    The front door of the house must be prominent and apparent from the street.

(B)    The autocourt must be in a regular, geometric shape such as a square, rectangle, circle, or oval, without added stubs for backing or parking, and create a cohesive, coherent design.

(C)    The autocourt is sized for access to multiple garage entries, but is not oversized to accommodate more than two (2) cars parking within the autocourt. 

(D)    The autocourt is paved in concrete, pavers, or other non-asphalt materials.

(E)    The autocourt is set back a minimum of three (3) feet from the public sidewalk. The setback contains a hedge, wall, or combination that is at least three (3) feet tall, opaque at the time of installation, and in the case of the hedge three (3) feet wide.

b.    Townhouse Driveway Dimensions (Attached Single Family on Individual Lots in UV-SF):

(1)    Each standard lot with driveway access from a street, woonerf, or similar facility except an alley shall provide a driveway which has an eighteen (18) foot minimum length. Maximum driveway width for a single car width shall be no more than ten (10) feet and for a double car width shall be no more than sixteen (16) feet; however, the driveway shall be no greater than sixty-seven (67) percent of the lot or unit width. Where driveway parking is not needed or possible, driveways shall be limited to eight (8) feet or less in length, and use other techniques which communicate that parking on the driveway apron is prohibited.

(2)    Where a townhouse has alley access, all vehicular access to the townhouse must be from the alley. Driveways from alleys must have an eighteen (18) foot minimum length where parking is desired, and shall be limited to four (4) feet or less in length where parking is prohibited.

c.    Materials: Driveways shall not be asphalt; acceptable materials include concrete, exposed aggregate, and pavers. 

3.    Garages:

a.    Garages which face a circulation facility with a pedestrian component shall have a maximum width of fifty (50) percent of the overall building width, unless the building’s facade is less than thirty-six (36) feet wide. On building facades (attached or detached) less than thirty-six (36) feet in width, facing a street or circulation facility whose facade includes both a front door and a garage, the width allotted to the garage should be minimized, and the width devoted to the front door and living space should be maximized; however, in no case shall the front door and the space on either side of it be less than six (6) feet in width. In addition, other elements that emphasize the presence and importance of the front door shall be including weather protection, lighting, landscape, special paving, etc.

b.    Garages must be sized to accommodate the required on-site number of standard-sized parking stalls, waste containers, and storage. Room for containers to hold three (3) waste streams shall be provided inside the garage. 

c.    In all cases, the presence of the garage shall be minimized from the street, woonerf, or similar facilities, which have a pedestrian component. Garages shall be set back a minimum of five (5) feet behind the front exterior walls of the residential living space and use elements such as overhangs (e.g., living spaces, terraces, trellises) to shade the garage doors to minimize their presence; except for certain homes on Harrison Way NE. See subsection (B)(3)(d) of this section.

d.    Due to expansive soils, the following Harrison Way NE homes (1748, 1756, 1764, 1772, 1780, 1788, 1796) may have garages in front of the house/living space, if they meet all of the following garage forward standards as follows:

(1)    Presence of the House: Maximize the proportion of lineal feet of occupied house frontage, minimize the proportion of garage frontage.

(2)    Prominent Architectural Features: Use prominent architectural elements at the front door and/or entry walk, as well as other nongarage portions of the house, to draw focus to the front door while taking attention away from the garage.

(3)    Roof Forms: To reduce the prominence of the garage, use roof forms that incorporate the garage into the overall form and composition of the house.

(4)    Single Doors: Must use single garage doors rather than double doors, even when three (3) car garages are provided.

(5)    Detailed Doors: Use garage doors which have detail and articulation contributing to the overall human scale and visual interest of the house.

(6)    Garage Doors Diversion: Use the arrangement and position of the other house elements (rooms, decks, roofs, etc.) to reduce the prominence of the garage by (in required order of action, though multiple techniques may be necessary and employed):

(A)    Overhanging or recessing the garage. The overhang should be living space or covered outdoor space.

(B)    Placing living space or roofed outdoor space above the garage.

(C)    Continuing a roof, trellis, or similar element above the garage doors to provide shade and reduce the garage’s prominence.

(7)    Materials and Colors: Use colors, materials, etc., to either integrate the garage into the house or create a complementary base for it.

(8)    Architectural Detailing: Use architectural detailing (open grill work, detailed balustrades, concrete detailing), more textured materials, and hardware (lighting fixtures, house numbers, handrails, etc.) to humanize the scale of the garage adjacent to the sidewalk.

(9)    Garage-Sidewalk Relationship: The garage should be set back a distance which minimizes pedestrian/vehicular conflicts.

(10)    Garage Door Color: Garage door color should be neither too light (draws attention) or too dark (looks like a cave).

(11)    Driveway Width: To reduce the driveway impacts on pedestrians, minimize the driveway width as it crosses the sidewalk.

(12)    Driveway Paving: Use paving materials and/or texture to integrate hardscape. Thus the driveway is not vacant space waiting for a car, but a courtyard or other people-oriented space. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.250 Woonerf standards.

A.    Purpose and Intent: “Woonerf” is a Dutch term which means a circulation area shared by pedestrians, wheeled users and vehicles, and accessible to surrounding uses. While pedestrians and vehicles mingle, the pedestrian, rather than the vehicle, is accorded the dominant role. Special layout and street furniture emphasize the prime function of the area as being a place for people. Driving speed is reduced to walking speed, and parking is allowed only in designated areas. Woonerfs are located in areas where urban space is encouraged to extend into the street. Elements of woonerfs may vary depending on the abutting uses. Access and use provisions shall be the same as those pertaining to public or private streets.

B.    General Requirements: The following special requirements shall apply to woonerfs:

1.    Woonerf designs shall accommodate vehicles but emphasize pedestrian use.

2.    Paving materials shall not include asphalt. Concrete, stamped concrete, pavers, or other durable materials which will support vehicular loads may be proposed for use.

3.    The entrance(s) shall be clearly signed with “pedestrians have right of way” or other approved signage. The entrance will also be distinguished by a driveway cut (see Chapter 18.19A IMC, Section 6.4.K for the appropriate standard) and other changes such as surface materials or grade.

4.    Woonerfs are designed with an inverted crown. No curbs may be used except in special circumstances:

a.    Adjacent to parking;

b.    Where surrounding grades cannot accommodate inverted crown drainage; or

c.    As approved by the Director. 

    Where curbs are approved, all curbs shall be vertical; no extruded curbs are allowed.

5.    With the review of site work, landscape, and/or building permits, houses fronting on any woonerf shall limit height or presence of elements (e.g., walls, landscaping) directly abutting the woonerf that would inhibit drivers and pedestrians (especially small children) exiting lots from seeing each other.

6.    A clear area of at least two (2) feet in depth shall be provided on the lot, so that emerging drivers or pedestrians can see and be seen by approaching traffic. This shall be provided in front of any adjacent entrances to dwellings, businesses, or garages, where potential pedestrian/vehicular conflicts may occur, and ensure adequate sightlines and landings. 

7.    Where parallel parking is allowed, it may be incorporated where there are uses that would use and benefit from its presence. No head-in or angled parking is allowed. The parking will be located on the side of the woonerf without curb cuts to maximize the number of available parking stalls. Parking areas, if provided, shall be clearly recognizable and parking spaces shall meet the dimensional requirements of Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 8 (Parking).

8.    Traffic calming devices shall be provided as necessary to reduce driving speed to walking speed, taking into consideration emergency services access needs and in consultation with the Fire Marshal. 

9.    Pedestrian and vehicular routes shall not be differentiated by curbs or striping.

10.    The woonerf shall be sufficiently well lit after dark to enable drivers to see potential obstacles such as changes in level, and for drivers and pedestrians to see each other. See Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 17 (Lighting).

11.    A woonerf may serve up to twenty-nine (29) homes. More intense uses require further analysis and approval by the Director.

12.    A five (5) foot easement shall be provided on each side of the woonerf to accommodate street trees and other landscape to benefit the pedestrian and ensure the trees are protected. This may be reduced if the side yard of a lot is adjacent to one (1) or both sides of the woonerf. In that case a three (3) foot landscape easement is required on each side, between the edge of the woonerf and any fencing on the private lot. Front door walkways and driveways may cross the easement to access each residence.

13.    Dead-end woonerfs, where a fire truck turnaround is not required, shall provide a method for private vehicles to turn around, such as easements on driveways, hammerheads, etc., as acceptable to the Director. 

14.    Public utilities associated with dead-end woonerfs shall be designed so that City maintenance vehicles do not have to enter the woonerf to maintain City utilities.

15.    Public utilities which are owned and maintained by the City and which are located on dead-end woonerfs shall be designed so that City maintenance vehicles do not have to enter the woonerf to maintain the City utilities.

16.    Woonerfs shall be privately owned and maintained. 

C.    Woonerf Standards: There are three (3) configurations of woonerf that may be constructed. See Figure 5, below.

1.    Type 1: woonerf with through traffic or fire turnaround:

a.    Two (2) ten (10) foot travel lanes;

b.    Seven (7) foot parking one (1) or both sides (optional).

2.    Type 2: dead-end, more than three (3) residences:

a.    Eighteen (18) feet wide;

b.    Maximum length shall be determined in consultation with the Fire Marshal based on whether fire trucks may enter and the distance a fire hose may be pulled;

c.    Parallel parking may be allowed within the woonerf with extra width of eight (8) feet and if there is no impact to emergency service access needs.

3.    Type 3: dead-end, limited to three (3) residences:

a.    Fifteen (15) feet wide;

b.    Maximum length shall be determined in consultation with the Fire Marshal based on whether fire trucks will enter and the distance a fire hose may be pulled;

(Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.260 Home occupations standards.

A.    Home occupations are permitted in Issaquah Highlands. A business license issued from the City shall be required and the type of business shall be as described in IMC 18.07.470. Additional business types not listed in the IMC shall be allowed subject to approval by the Director, and determined by:

1.    Client parking demand;

2.    Nuisance characteristics (e.g., air emission, vibration, noise, heat, light and glare); and

3.    Conformance with the home occupation criteria listed below.

B.    Home occupations shall meet all of the following criteria:

1.    Number of employees: maximum one (1) person from outside the residential unit.

2.    Gross floor area: no maximum.

3.    Signs:

a.    Nameplate as allowed by Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 9.

b.    Where there are ground-related residential units on streets designated for sidewalk use in Chapter 12.05 IMC, legal and permitted home occupations may choose to add a pedestrian-oriented sign as regulated by Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 9, as an additional sign for home occupation.

4.    Outside storage or display: none permitted.

5.    Off-street parking: none required (except as required for residential use).

6.    Deliveries to site: permitted; provided, that the quantity of deliveries and the type of delivery vehicle do not negatively impact the neighborhood in which the home occupation is located.

7.    Customers: maximum one (1) customer vehicle at any given time.

8.    Other Requirements:

a.    Owner/operator of the home occupation must reside on site;

b.    Business area will not be counted towards zoning cap in the overlay. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.270 Processing of applications including adjustments and modifications of standards.

A.    Adjustment of Standards: Any revisions not specifically excluded by subsection F of this section (Council Modifications), or Chapter 18.19A IMC (Section 1.1(E)), may be approved by the Director. The criteria and process for review are in Chapter 18.19A IMC. 

B.    Commission Review of Certain Land Use Permits As Established by Chapter 18.19A IMC or This Title: Following the termination of a development agreement, where review of subsequent permits is required to be at a Commission, the review will occur at the Development Commission. 

C.    Preliminary Plats and Required Community Conference:

1.    Following determination that a complete submittal for preliminary plat has been received, City staff shall schedule a community conference with the Development Commission, unless another commission or board has reason to hold a meeting for this project. Then that commission or board would hold the community conference, e.g., Rivers and Streams Board.

2.    The community conference is an informal public meeting hosted by the Commission. The purpose of the community conference is to generate discussion, raise issues, and propose creative options relative to the proposed preliminary plat. It is intended to provide a means by which the applicant, staff, the Commission, and the public work together in a productive and creative manner to initially review the proposal’s compliance with the Comprehensive Plan; this chapter, replacement regulations; and, as applicable: Chapter 18.19A IMC, CIDDS; and the IMC. 

3.    Following the community conference, staff with the assistance of the applicant (if they choose) will prepare a community conference response memo. The memo will summarize topics, concerns, and opportunities raised at the community conference; review them within the context of the proposal and applicable codes; provide responses from staff and the applicant (if they choose to respond); and provide a conclusion for each topic as to what should or should not happen relative to the proposal and applicable codes.

4.    The community conference response memo will be provided to parties of record and the Development Commission. They will be given a two (2) week comment period in which to provide additional comment as to the content and responses contained in the memo. 

5.    If consistent with Code, any further comments received shall be incorporated into the community conference response memo, and applied either as corrections to the plat drawings or proposed conditions of approval.

6.    The final community conference response memo shall be an attachment to the Hearing Examiner staff report.

D.    Thresholds Triggering a Site Development Permit Review: A site development permit or Level 3 review is required for those development proposals or uses with any one (1) or more of the following characteristics:

1.    The site is equal to or greater than three (3) gross acres.

2.    The proposed building(s) on a site are equal to or greater than forty-five thousand (45,000) square feet of gross floor area.

3.    The site’s primary access and/or street frontage are located on and/or the site abuts one (1) or more of the following streets: Highlands Dr. NE, 9th Ave. NE, NE Park Dr. (west of the BPA corridor), NE Discovery Dr., NE Ellis Dr., NE Federal Dr.

E.    Subdivision of Land or Adjustment of Property Boundaries and Changes to the Overlay or Zoning Cap: Property covered by these replacement regulations and which chooses to subdivide their land or adjust their property lines would have their overlay or zoning cap distributed as follows:

1.    Single Family Lots (UV-SF): Lots may be subdivided or adjusted, but the overlay or zoning cap may not be subdivided. This would result in a lot without the right to build an additional unit.

2.    Nonresidential Overlay or Zoning Cap: Parcels which are subdivided or adjust their property lines subsequent to the adoption of the replacement regulations would have their zoning cap divided between the old and new lots at the discretion of the property owner(s) as long as at no time the resulting zoning cap would cause the property’s development capacity to fall below the minimum FAR (floor area ratio).

3.    Multifamily or Mixed Use Residential Overlay or Zoning Cap: Parcels which are subdivided or adjust their property lines subsequent to the adoption of the replacement regulations would have their zoning cap divided between the old and new lots at the discretion of the property owner(s) as long as at no time the resulting zoning cap would cause the property’s development capacity to fall below the minimum density. The minimum residential density is five (5) dwelling units per acre.

4.    The same principles would apply to mixed use parcels, although the resulting parcels are not required to be mixed use after subdivision.

5.    Segregation of the property, resulting in parcels without entitlement, is allowed only if the resulting parcel is used for a purpose not requiring a zoning cap, e.g., parking, stormwater vault, plaza. 

During the land use permit review process for subdividing (e.g., short plat or long subdivision) or adjusting property lines (e.g., lot line adjustment), staff will review the division of the zoning cap per the above criteria. With approval of the subdivision or property line adjustment, Figure 2 would be administratively updated to reflect the changes.

F.    Council Modifications: The following changes must be decided by the City Council following a review and recommendation from either the Planning Policy or Development Commission, as determined by the Director. The process for reviewing the proposed Council modifications shall follow Chapter 18.04 IMC, Level 6 review process.

1.    Changes to zoning shown in Figure 2, or as described in IMC 18.19B.130.

2.    Changes to the overlay or zoning cap shown in Figure 2 except as allowed in subsection E of this section.

3.    The inclusion of any land uses in IMC 18.19B.130 which the Director determines are outside the scope of IMC 18.19B.040.

4.    Increases in building heights from those specified in IMC 18.19B.140.

5.    Removal or reduction in size of parks, plazas, or informal gathering areas where they are shown on the following: Figure 3, 3A or 4. 

6.    Removal or reduction of trails in existence as of the date of adoption of this chapter.

7.    The use of transfer of development rights in the nonresidential areas of Issaquah Highlands, within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the Issaquah Highlands Park and Ride. All other use of transfer of development rights in Issaquah Highlands is prohibited. (See the City’s adopted TDR map for permitted locations.) (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19B.280 Vesting of permits. 

A.    Only vesting established by Washington State law shall apply to the vesting of development applications for properties located within Issaquah Highlands previously covered by the terminated development agreements. These are: 

1.    Building permits which comply with RCW 19.27.095; or

2.    Long or short plats which comply with RCW 58.17.033; or

3.    Development agreements per RCW 36.70B.180. (Ord. 2830 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).

Introduction


18.19C.010 Purpose.

The purpose of these standards is to provide replacement regulations for sunsetted development agreement for an Urban Village within the City, inspiring an animated and connected urban community where pedestrians are priority, requiring buildings and open space that are openly interrelated, designing sites that make a positive contribution to the public realm, attracting and retaining businesses that complement each Urban Village’s vision, and, ultimately, creating a place where people of all income levels and diversities are drawn to live, work and play. These standards promote the construction of developments that will have an appealing and visually engaging public realm in order to encourage social interaction, outdoor activity and a pedestrian orientation in a sustainable, compact, mixed use area. 

More specifically for Talus: The replacement regulations for Talus are as an urban village committed to retaining a distinct neighborhood with a mountain village character. It also recognizes the importance of both quality of design in the built environment and sensitivity to the natural environment. In terms of the built environment, good design must mean not only a visually pleasing community but one that embraces architectural diversity and provides a variety of opportunities for social interaction among residents, employees, and visitors. The Talus vision embraces: clustered development and large areas of open space connected by an extensive pedestrian and vehicular circulation system; housing for many lifestyles, age groups, and incomes; a limited number of opportunities for working and shopping in a pedestrian friendly setting. Appropriate site planning will provide connectivity between uses, proximity of uses to each other, and siting of structures and landscape elements to reinforce the street. These elements work together to create a public realm that encourages social interaction between community members. As developed, Talus has a mountain village character, which though described as “urban” in Attachments 1 and 2 of this chapter (Talus Appendix A and Talus Appendix B) is less dense and includes less diversity of uses than other urban villages. Future changes to either the replacement regulations (this chapter) and/or applicable Central Issaquah standards (Chapter 18.19A IMC) must take into account the actual, not aspirational, character of Talus’ mountain village. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.020 Intent.

The intent of the goals, guidelines, development and design standards of the replacement regulations is to generally maintain the current character and land use relationships of Talus; achieve compatible land uses within zoning districts and surrounding areas by providing uniform regulations throughout each district; encouraging neighborhood stability and consistency, promoting commercial viability and compatibility; and retaining Talus’ distinct character within the historic design and scale of Issaquah. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.030 Scope and applicability.

A.    This chapter contains goals, guidelines, and standards applicable to all Talus’ districts, projects, and properties following the sunset of the development agreement that guided its development. The Urban Village whose development agreement has currently been terminated and is now regulated by these replacement regulations is Talus. The following standards and procedures apply to properties previously entitled through a development agreement as specifically listed in this section. For any development provisions (e.g., stormwater standards, critical area regulations, tree retention, signage, etc.) not specifically listed in this chapter, standard provisions of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Central Issaquah Area Development and Design Standards) (CIDDS) apply, except for CIDDS tree regulations 10.10 through 10.14; instead the Urban Village covered by these replacement regulations shall use tree regulations in Chapter 18.12 IMC (IMC 18.12.1370 through 18.12.1390). To the extent that this chapter and Chapter 18.19A IMC do not establish applicable development and design standards, processes, procedures, or other elements covering a certain subject, element or condition, development shall be governed by the Issaquah Municipal Code and other City codes.

B.    The following rules shall apply to facilitate the use of Chapter 18.19A IMC, Central Issaquah Development and Design Standards (CIDDS), with this chapter, Talus replacement regulations:

1.    Chapter 18.19A IMC excludes Urban Villages covered by development agreements; however, since the Urban Village covered by this chapter is no longer regulated by development agreements, Chapter 18.19A IMC will apply to it to the extent provided in subsection A of this section.

2.    Where language in Chapter 18.19A IMC refers to “Central Issaquah” as a geographic place, it shall mean “Talus.”

3.    Where language in Chapter 18.19A IMC refers to “Central Issaquah vision” or “Central Issaquah Plan,” it shall be deemed to mean “Talus vision, goals, and guidelines (as appropriate)” when applied to properties governed by this chapter. The Talus vision, goals, and guidelines are located in Attachments 1 and 2 to this chapter.

4.    Where language in Chapter 18.19A IMC refers to “Development and Design Standards,” it shall include “or Talus Replacement Regulations, as appropriate” when applied to properties governed by this chapter.

5.    Section 1.1.E.2, Scope, in Chapter 18.19A IMC, as applied to Talus, shall be interpreted to read: “No administrative adjustment may be made for standards or requirements listed below, except as otherwise permitted by this code or 18.19C, where applicable:”

6.    In Table 4.3A, Levels of Review, in Chapter 18.19A IMC, the Urban Villages regulated by this chapter follow those for “Village Residential, Mixed Use Residential, Destination Retail and Mixed Use, …” IMC 18.19C.270, Processing of applications including adjustments and modifications of standards, establishes additional thresholds for levels of review for Talus.

7.    Central Issaquah Figures 6A, 7A and 7B do not apply to Talus. For standards in Chapter 18.19A IMC which reference Figure 6A to determine the location or applicable standard of circulation facilities, existing Talus circulation facilities, existing or anticipated circulation demand, and block lengths, as required by Chapter 18.19A IMC, shall substitute for Figure 6A. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.040 Interpretations and conflicts.

Unless specifically identified otherwise, the Director is authorized to interpret this Code, acting on the City’s initiative, or in response to an inquiry. The purpose of interpretations is to clarify the Code responsibilities, rules, procedures, and requirements, including resolving conflicting or silent text, determining unidentified uses, etc. The vision, goals, and policies within the Talus replacement regulations are fixed; methods to implement can be flexible. Anyone may request an interpretation of this Code by filing a written request with the Permit Center. The Director shall respond, in writing, to all requests for formal interpretation. Clarifying language of one (1) interpretation of this Code may be used for another interpretation of this Code. If any conflict arises between this Code and another rule, regulation, resolution, ordinance or statute which has been lawfully adopted by the City, the provision that best implements the general or specific Talus goals and policies shall apply, as determined by the Director. Requests for interpretations will be available to the public on the City’s website. The Director will not act on the requested interpretation for ten (10) days following its posting on the City’s webpage. Interpretations, once issued, may be appealed to the Hearing Examiner following procedures in this title. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.050 Definitions.

The following terms, as used in this chapter, are defined below. Where definitions are not provided below, Chapter 18.19A IMC applies. If definitions are not provided in either Chapter 18.19A or 18.19B IMC, then the definitions in Chapter 18.02 IMC apply as established above in IMC 18.19C.030:

Assisted living: “Assisted living,” for the purposes of allowed uses in these regulations, is any of a variety of senior care facilities that provides either permanent or temporary residence for senior citizens. These facilities must provide on-site services for residents such as common dining areas (although some facilities may offer kitchen facilities in the individual rooms), and health services, such as a resident nurse. An assisted living facility is not senior housing, independent living, retirement community, adult family home or residential care facility. It may include convalescent home, skilled nursing or hospital.

Hillside and sloped sites: Sites or portions of sites that rise at an inclination of twelve (12) percent or more within a vertical elevation change of at least ten (10) feet. 

Natural grade: Existing grade of the site as of the adoption of the Design Manual, excluding temporary features such as stormwater or TESC ponds and stockpiles of soil.

Mountain Village: A less-dense Urban Village form due to topography and critical areas that provides primarily residential at a variety of densities, with limited nonresidential land uses incorporated.

Neighborhood-serving retail: Retail which provides for the sale of goods and personal services for the day-to-day living needs of the neighborhood, as opposed to regional retail focused on drawing, and even requiring, regional customers.

Overlay: Superimposed over conventional zoning districts, it consists of a physical area with mapped boundaries and provides additional zoning information specific to that property, such as zoning cap.

Park: An element of the public realm that is an outdoor, open gathering place that is designed for public access to open air spaces, for social and recreational purposes. Recreation can accommodate passive and/or active uses. The park may contain a variety of design treatments, including both soft and hard surfaces, though more landscape areas and lawn than hardscape. Modest structures such as gazebos are allowed. Parks are located in commercial and residential neighborhoods, and fulfill a wide variety of purposes, serving people of various age groups and abilities.

Retaining wall: Walls whose primary purpose is retaining soil and/or a cut or fill slope. 

Senior housing: An establishment providing residence for retired persons who are not in need of medical or nursing treatment except in the case of temporary illness. Senior housing may also be called independent living or a retirement community. “Senior housing” does not include assisted living, nursing, convalescent, hospitals, or sanitariums.

Site walls: Walls that may or may not retain soil, and which may be also used for fall protection, delineation of space, substitute streetwall, etc. Retaining walls are a subset of site walls. 

Sociable public realm: See Chapter 18.19A IMC, definition for “Public Realm.”

Urban Village: The Urban Villages were established to encourage innovative uses, sites and comprehensive planning of large land parcels. Master planning and development of larger parcels provide the opportunity for reasonably priced housing, enhanced public services and concurrency, infrastructure solutions and improvements, and allow creative land development through clustering, permanent preservation of wetlands and other natural areas, integration of recreational facilities and phasing of infrastructure. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).

Goals, Guidelines, Development Standards


18.19C.100 Planning goals.

Attachment 1 contains Appendix A adopted in the Talus Development Agreement, as modified prior to termination of the agreement. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.110 Urban Village Design Guidelines.

A.    Attachment 2 contains Appendix B adopted in the Talus Development Agreement, as modified prior to termination of the agreement. 

B.    See Figure 1 for the location in Talus of land uses referenced in the Urban Village Design Guidelines. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.120 Homeowner’s or Commercial Association Architectural Review Committee (ARC).

Prior to submittal for any permit, a property owner or agent with authority to act for a property owner must demonstrate that they have obtained ARC approval for those permits where the ARC has purview; or they must demonstrate that the ARC is inactive to the satisfaction of the Director. The Architecture and Urban Design Manual located in Chapter 18 of Chapter 18.19A IMC does not apply within Talus. Its functions are performed by the ARC if and until such time as the ARC is determined to be inactive. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.130 Zoning districts and permitted land uses.

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of zoning and land uses is to protect public health, safety and general welfare by implementing the goals and policies adopted in the Issaquah Comprehensive Plan; the Planning Goals of Talus; and the Urban Village Design Guidelines. The intent of the zoning and land uses is to:

1.    Maintain the established character of Talus without preventing its growth, completion, and vitality.

2.    Retain and pursue a balanced mix of land uses that achieve the live/work/play vision.

3.    Preserving and establishing pedestrian- and bike-oriented transportation, while maintaining the functional needs of the automobile. 

B.    Zoning and Overlay Created: Property zoning is established by designation on an adopted map; and through an overlay. The “zoning” layer identifies the land use that is approved for every property that previously was covered by the development agreement. The overlay identifies the zoning cap (i.e., square footage and/or number of residential units) that can be accommodated on the property.

(Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.200 Hillside sites. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: Development in Talus should strengthen existing assets, including hillsides. These sites are essential components to the character of Issaquah and views the community cherishes. Development must respect the topographic character of each site through building design and siting, and minimizing the height of retaining walls, with the intention of blending into the native environment and retaining existing trees. For sites which include hillsides, development will minimize disturbance to the hillside, respond to the natural grade, and provide visual mitigations such as terraced walls and revegetation on disturbed areas.

B.    Standards:

1.    Projects on sites or portions of sites equal to or greater than fifteen (15) percent (minimum vertical elevation change of at least fifteen (15) feet) shall step the building foundations, building rooflines, and bench or terrace site cuts or fills resulting in buildings (foundations and overall massing) that follow the natural grade. 

2.    For uphill sites, only use maximum building height and do not use average grade or averaging of building heights, for the purpose of minimizing the visual impact of the building.

3.    Exposed cuts and fills shall be minimized, and final grading recontoured and landscaped to blend into the site and appear natural. To achieve that, no changes to the natural grades (cut or fill) may be more than fifteen (15) feet.

4.    Regardless of the site’s character, retaining walls on the site shall be no taller than ten (10) feet, with trees (thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet o.c.) and shrubs planted in front of the wall. If taller walls are required, walls shall be terraced with enough space between walls to comfortably accommodate shrubs, vines, and ground cover, and, if the wall design accommodates it, trees. Landscape’s purpose is to soften the visual impact of walls and blend them into their setting.

5.    Buildings placed in hillside areas must be designed to blend with the surrounding hillside using colors and articulation which are consistent with the balance of the building. Select building materials and colors to reduce the visual impact of the building.

6.    All walls will be articulated and receive architectural treatment if they are visible, including the downhill portions of the building. In addition to architectural treatment of the visible portions of foundations and lower building walls, landscape screening is also necessary.

7.    Straight, engineered, unnatural appearing slopes, walls, and/or landscape are not allowed. These must blend with the surroundings, including natural open space when present.

8.    Buildings shall not interrupt natural ridgelines.

9.    The following graphic conceptually illustrates for uphill sites how buildings, foundations, and site cuts would follow the natural grade:
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.210 Site walls. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: Site walls may be necessary or desirable even on flat sites. Where they are used they must be factored into creating a public realm that is pedestrian friendly and engaging, through material selection, placement, height, etc. Some wall styles are appropriate in or adjacent to natural open spaces, while other styles are suited to the built environment. Where walls are necessary or desirable, use walls that contribute to the selected architectural style and positively add to the public realm.

B.    Standards:

1.    Site walls adjacent to pedestrian areas (e.g., walkways, sidewalks, trails) shall be no taller than four (4) feet in height. If taller walls are required, e.g., as a retaining wall, two (2) choices are available:

a.    Up to four (4) foot tall wall next to or near the pedestrian area, with taller walls (up to ten (10) feet in height) terraced behind the lower wall.

b.    Up to ten (10) foot tall wall set back from the pedestrian area with enough setback to accommodate evergreen trees spaced every thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet. Additional walls may be terraced behind the first wall. Setback must accommodate mature tree size without impinging on pedestrian area. Setback space between trees will be filled with shrubs and ground covers consistent with CIDDS landscape standards.

c.    In all cases of terracing, walls shall be terraced with enough space between walls to comfortably accommodate shrubs, vines, and ground cover, and, if the wall design accommodates it, trees, to soften the visual impact of walls and blend them into their setting. 

2.    Wall materials shall complement the selected architectural styles, such as block or shotcrete covered soil nail walls. Wall materials shall not distract from the overall composition and the selected architectural style. Tri-plane faced block is an example of a distracting and busy wall material. 

3.    Materials shall be scored or changed at a pedestrian scale frequency. Pedestrian scale materials include brick and other block or modular element. If concrete is used, it shall be treated architecturally with scoring or other detailing, at a human scaled frequency.

4.    Walls up to four (4) feet in height and longer than thirty-five (35) feet in length will be articulated and modulated, at a frequency of, at a minimum, thirty-five (35) feet.

5.    Rockeries or timber walls may not be used except when adjacent to natural open spaces. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.220 Parks and plazas. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose of this section is to encourage a variety of gathering and recreational opportunities through the inclusion of parks and plazas in Talus. It is expected that good design principles will be applied to all spaces, including:

1.    Create gathering and recreational opportunities that are visually inviting to users.

2.    Provide enjoyable places to sit, walk, gather or play.

3.    Achieve the desired community functions.

4.    Encourage variety and interest within the urban environment.

C.    Project Buffers:

1.    A vegetative buffer not less than one hundred (100) feet wide shall be preserved on the east side of the Talus property adjacent to the existing westerly right-of-way line of State Route 900 (the parcels north and south of the Talus main entry, and the properties east of Parcel 5D; see Figure 1), except that: 

a.    Existing drainage retention/detention facilities approved by the City may be maintained within such buffer. “Existing drainage retention/detention facilities” means facilities which have been accepted by the City. Some construction or reconstruction may be required prior to acceptance. All such work must be permitted by the City.

b.    Trails approved by the City may be maintained within such buffer.

c.    Existing entry features approved by the City may be maintained within such buffer.

2.    A vegetative buffer not less than fifty (50) feet wide shall be preserved on the westerly boundary of Parcels 7, 8, and 10 through 12 (the location of which is shown on Figure 1), except that trails and existing public water utility facilities, approved by the Director, may be maintained within such buffer.

3.    For the purposes of this subsection, “existing” means on the date the replacement regulations for Talus are adopted, except as allowed in this section.

D.    General Standards: The following general requirements shall apply to parks, plazas, and informal gathering areas. Any outside resources referenced in these standards (e.g., ASTM, ISA standards, or ANSI) shall use the most recent version; or the Director may substitute a more current and equivalent code or resource in consultation with the Parks Director and best practices.

1.    Views and linkages to streets and other public spaces and buildings shall be respected and reinforced through site planning and/or design elements.

All pruning shall be done in accordance with the International Society of Arboriculture Standards as amended. Topping (the severe reduction of branches without consideration of the specifications for cutting back) of trees is prohibited. 

18.    All fertilizer and pesticide applications shall conform to the City standards. Fertilizer and pesticide applications shall be made in a manner that will inhibit their entry into waterways, wetlands and storm drains.

19.    All plants shall be adapted to their sites (sun exposure, cold hardiness, hydrozones, soil type, soil pH, etc.). Plants with differing environmental/cultural requirements shall not be used together if desirable circumstances cannot be provided for both. New plant materials shall consist of native or drought tolerant varieties or nonnative species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of the Greater Issaquah area and in conformance with Chapters 10 and 16 of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Landscape Development and Design Standards).

20.    All plant materials used shall meet the most recent American Association of Nurseryman Standards for nursery stock: ANSI 260.1.

21.    Plants having similar water use characteristics (hydrozones) shall be grouped together.

22.    All landscaped areas shall incorporate water conservation measures. 

23.    Parks and plazas shall be located to minimize construction impacts on critical areas. 

24.    Soil amendments may be necessary for a healthy growing medium, which will increase the survival rate for new planting and reduce ongoing maintenance requirements:

a.    Incorporate water and nutrient holding materials into the soil as deep as possible. Use fully composted organic material.

b.    Mulch new planting areas to minimize evaporation, reduce weed growth and slow erosion. Use fully composted material.

c.    Feather all mulches used in planter beds to the base of the plants.

d.    Water tubes should also be added to the tree plantings to allow water to penetrate the soil.

E.    Parks – Net New Development:

1.    With net new residential development, new parks will be provided at the minimum rate of two hundred fifty (250) square feet per residential unit. The requirement only applies to “net new” units. That is new dwelling units constructed, above and beyond those in place upon effective date of this code or those dwelling units whose land use permits are vested by a separate development agreement or per IMC 18.19C.280. To meet the requirement, the parks must have the following characteristics:

a.    Parks will comply with the applicable Talus goal and guideline documents.

b.    The park space must be provided on site. For multifamily projects this means as part of the parcel. For single family plats, parks would be an integral part of the plat, though potentially on a separate tract or parcel.

c.    The park shall have visual and recreation variety pedestrian amenities, and appeal to the senses. It will engage all age groups through elements such as seating, lighting, water features, special paving, landscaping, artwork and special recreational features. It will provide both sun and shade.

d.    Locational characteristics: away from surface parking lots, loading/waste collection/service areas. The land shall be configured to be useable, pleasant, and an integral component of the project or plat in which it is located. It will not be located on “leftover” property or in locations that are isolated or hidden which might create security or perceived safety concerns.

e.    The park should have an access easement.

F.    Plazas: Plazas are outdoor open gathering places which are primarily hard surface, but which may contain landscaping. They denote important places, create a focus, and/or increase light and air at street level. They also function as points of orientation. They may be located adjacent to buildings, within a park or other open space, or independent. The following general requirements shall apply to plazas in Talus:

1.    Plazas may be constructed with concrete, pavers, or special paving material. Asphalt is not permitted.

2.    Root barriers shall be provided for all trees planted within plazas.

3.    Seating must be provided. The seating may be fixed or moveable, or a combination of both. Required seating may be provided by ledges, fountains, sculptures, benches, chairs, stairs, etc. At least two (2) of the seats shall meet ADA standards. For purposes of determining the number of seats provided on a bench, ledge, fountain, etc., eighteen (18) lineal inches on a horizontal surface is considered one (1) seat.

4.    The spacing, location and type of required street trees may be modified when adjacent to a plaza.

5.    A portion of a plaza may be used for reserved seating for restaurants or other uses.

6.    Permanent structures may be provided within a plaza provided they do not preclude use of and access to the plaza by the general public. Structures may be enclosed or open air and may be leased for commercial use.

7.    Physical obstructions between a plaza and a sidewalk or public park shall be designed to provide sufficient visibility to protect the public safety of the users of the plaza and to ensure that public access to the plaza is convenient, obvious and welcoming. No walls or structures shall exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height above the abutting sidewalk or public park for a total of more than fifty (50) percent of the lineal footage along one (1) side of a plaza that directly abuts a public street right-of-way or public park.

G.    Plazas with New Development: At a minimum, new plazas will be provided at the rate of twenty-five (25) square feet per one thousand (1,000) square feet of new nonresidential construction, except new public school facilities. The plaza shall be provided on site. It may be broken into multiple spaces; however, when multiple plazas are selected no plaza which counts to the requirement may be smaller than two thousand (2,000) square feet in size. Plazas shall be located to serve both the site’s users and the public. 

H.    Park or Plaza Relocation: Where a parcel is being redeveloped and Figure 3 shows an existing park or required plaza being identified on that property, the applicant may propose to relocate the park or plaza with the same or better square footage, functional equivalence, and sense of public access without requiring Council approval. Approval shall occur with the required land use and construction permits. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.230 Trails. 

A.    Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of this section is to encourage a variety of experiences through public and private trail systems, on which no motorized vehicles are permitted. Minimum requirements and standards are established to promote safety, incorporate maintenance considerations, identify infrastructure requirements, and reduce the impact of development on the environment. It is expected that good design principles will be applied at all times, including:

1.    Safety and accessibility to trail users;

2.    Well-built trails, constructed in a manner appropriate to their use, users, and location;

3.    Environmental stewardship; and

4.    Well-planned connections between properties, open spaces, and to the identified regional trails of Talus.

B.    General Standards: The following requirements apply to all trail types. Any outside resources referenced in these standards (e.g., ISA standards, or ANSI) shall use the most recent version; or the Director may substitute a more current and equivalent code or resource in consultation with the Parks Director and best practices:

1.    Adequate drainage shall be provided.

2.    Locate trails to minimize construction impacts on critical areas. Trail corridors may meander to avoid impacts to critical areas and to correspond with topographical conditions.

3.    Nonmotorized circulation shall be located in areas with minimum slopes, where possible, to provide access to people of various age groups and abilities. Where slopes cannot be avoided, nonmotorized surfaces up to twelve (12) percent may use soft surfaces where that surface type is allowed by subsection C of this section. Slopes between twelve (12) percent and fifteen (15) percent must be hard or stabilized surfaces appropriate for the trail type (e.g., hard surfaces may not be used in critical areas). Where slopes are twelve (12) percent or greater, stairs may be required. Where steps are used, there must be a minimum of two (2) steps, and they must be generally level. Also where stairs are appropriate or necessary, bike rails may be required.

4.    Border plantings shall be compatible with adjacent landscaping in terms of irrigation, maintenance and style.

5.    Trails that will be maintained by the City shall contain low maintenance border plantings.

6.    Incorporate the use of native, drought tolerant, or landscape material supportive of urban habitat, where appropriate.

7.    If used, design and locate pedestrian lighting to minimize impacts to abutting uses or critical area habitats.

8.    The incorporation of rest stop facilities (benches and trash receptacles) should be provided, where appropriate.

9.    Bollards or other devices for controlling vehicular access at street connections and other appropriate locations shall be provided for emergency and maintenance access.

10.    Trails shall be maintained so as to minimize vegetation that may be hazardous to the safety, visibility, and clearances of trail users. All pruning shall be done in accordance with the most recently adopted version of the International Society of Arboriculture Standards and consistent with Chapters 10 and 16 of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Landscape Development and Design Standards). Tree topping (the severe reduction of branches without consideration of the pruning specifications) is prohibited.

11.    Trails shall be located to minimize light and noise impacts on neighboring residential uses.

12.    Trails shall be located in areas with minimum slopes, where possible, to provide recreational access to people of various age groups and abilities.

13.    Provide signage or other indicators for trail user safety at intersections with streets.

14.    Landscape planting or buffers required by trail standards may be used to meet the trail border requirements.

15.    No fences are allowed within a trail corridor.

16.    Trail borders shall be maintained to provide safe trailside and head clearances.

17.    Where appropriate, the trail tread should be comprised of a structural base to support bicycle use on soft surface trails.

18.    Trails located within critical areas shall comply with the standards set forth in Chapter 18.10 IMC (critical area regulations).

19.    The following trails are allowed in critical areas: multi-purpose (critical areas), neighborhood trail, and forest path. All other trail types are prohibited.

20.    Signs indicating permitted uses shall be placed at every trail entrance. Trail signs shall conform to a design approved by the City of Issaquah in conformance with Chapter 9 of Chapter 18.19A IMC (Sign Standards) and Chapter 18.10 IMC (critical area regulations).

21.    Corridors shall allow for adequate sight distances, based on uses and locations.

22.    Signs requiring bicyclists to dismount on boardwalk portions of trails shall be posted.

1     Trail widths and trail corridors may be increased upon request by the applicant and approval by the Director.

2    “Border” means a planting area adjacent to the trail shoulder or trail. Borders may coincide with required landscaped buffers or landscape on adjacent property. Borders shall be measured from the outside edge of the trail tread, except for multi-purpose trails that shall be measured from the outside edge of the shoulders. 

3    Mineral soils will be used when they are present; crushed rock will be used if mineral soils and/or structural base cannot be established and following best practices. Crushed rock may not be used within twenty (20) feet of right-of-way.

4    Secondary uses or unlisted nonmotorized uses are permitted when the trail can be designed to make the secondary uses compatible, safe, and acceptable with pedestrian activity. Secondary users may encounter segments of a trail which will require caution or a detour due to specific trail tread surfacing. The Director must approve changes to the list of primary or secondary users.

5    Bicyclists must dismount on boardwalks.

6    For critical areas and surface water management facilities only.

D.    Description of Trails for Use in Talus:

1.    Trails will retain the designation (trail type) under which they were reviewed and constructed. If it is unclear which trail standard was used, the Director will make a determination based on the closest description below and dimensions and/or materials above. 

2.    Description of Trails:

a.    Multi-Purpose Trail: Multi-purpose trails are high-use paved trails designed to provide recreational opportunities for pedestrians and nonmotorized wheel users. Multi-purpose trails are intended to provide or connect with community-wide or regional routes for pedestrians and nonmotorized wheel users. They should be located to link major community facilities, recreational complexes, schools, other multi-purpose trails, and major transportation access points to community-wide or regional routes.

b.    Multi-Purpose Trail (Critical Areas): Multi-purpose trails through critical areas are soft surface trails intended to provide flexibility when a multi-purpose trail moves through a critical area. They provide pedestrian and bicycle movement through critical areas with minimal disturbance.

c.    Neighborhood Trail: Neighborhood trails are hard or soft surface trails designed to provide recreational opportunities for pedestrians. They are intended to provide connections between neighborhoods or between neighborhoods and community land uses and to interconnect sidewalk systems. Typically, neighborhood trails should be located in or adjacent to neighborhoods, open spaces or critical areas.

d.    Forest Path: Forest paths are narrow, soft surface, low impact trails that meander through critical areas, critical area buffers and forested areas with existing vegetation. Forest paths are constructed, pursuant to U.S. Forest Service Standards, to minimize impacts and to adapt to existing conditions such as steep slopes and heavily vegetated areas. Forest paths are low usage trails that provide an environmental and recreational experience. Additionally, where these trails traverse areas subject to frequent inundation from water, a boardwalk-type tread may be used to enable pedestrian passage. The intent of the forest path is to provide pedestrian connections through forested areas (such as uneven surfaces, steeper grades, rocks, etc.).

e.    Pedestrian Trail: Pedestrian trails are developed when pedestrians are likely to be the primary users. These hard surfaced trails provide direct connections for nonbicyclists in typically higher pedestrian traffic areas, such as providing links to the multi-purpose trails within the Village Center.

    Unlike other typically pedestrian-oriented trails, pedestrian trails provide direct visual and physical access from neighborhoods to major community event locations or between major community focal points. This trail type is not intended to be used in medium and low density uses, unless providing a direct physical or visual link to a community focal point. When a pedestrian trail corridor abuts a mixed use, retail or commercial use, hardscape or container plantings may replace the planted border requirement. Hardscape may include, but is not limited to, paving materials, fountains, sculpture or other art forms.

E.    Existing Trails:

1.    All trails in existence in Talus upon the date of adoption of these standards shall be retained. Removal or reduction of an existing trail must be approved through a Council modification process as outlined in IMC 18.19C.270. 

2.    The trails shown in the Talus Master Trails Plan, Figure 4, are considered existing trails per subsection (E)(1) of this section.

3.    Where a parcel is being redeveloped and Figure 4 or a previous land use permit shows an existing trail on that property, the applicant may propose to relocate the trail with the same or better classification, connectivity, and sense of public access without requiring Council approval.  Approval shall occur with the required land use and construction permits. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.240 Single family and townhouse standards.

A.    Applicability and Purpose: The single family and townhouse standards are for use with residences in the UV-SF zone. The purpose is to retain the design and development standards used in building Talus and which created residential streetscapes that emphasized people, pedestrians, and homes while reducing the impact of the automobile and garage on them.

B.    Design and Development Standards:

1.    Unit Orientation: The front door of the unit will face the street or public pedestrian route, and will have a prominent presence from the street through its placement, orientation, architectural elements, and proportions. Each unit will have a pedestrian walkway between the public pedestrian route and the front door, separate from the driveway. There may also be a pedestrian connection from the driveway to the front door or front walk.

2.    Parking and Driveways:

a.    Single Family Driveway Dimensions:

(1)    Each lot with driveway access from a street, woonerf, or similar facility except an alley shall provide a driveway which has an eighteen (18) foot minimum length and maximum driveway width of twenty (20) feet. Where driveway parking is not needed or possible, driveways shall be limited to eight (8) feet or less in length, and use other techniques which communicate that parking on the driveway apron is prohibited.

(2)    Where lots are narrower than forty (40) feet, the driveway cut within the right-of-way may not be wider than sixteen (16) feet plus two (2) foot wings. 

(3)    Where a wider driveway is functionally necessary (such as to serve a three (3) car garage), use landscape or other elements acceptable to the Director to break the driveway into sections, each twenty (20) feet or less in width. See example below. 
[IMAGE]


(4)    Where a lot has alley access, all vehicular access to the lot must be from the alley. Driveways from alleys must have an eighteen (18) foot minimum length where parking is desired, and shall be limited to four (4) feet or less in length where parking is prohibited.

(5)    A lot may have one (1) driveway cut from a street or other circulation facility with a pedestrian component, unless the driveway forms a “U” in which case two (2) driveway cuts are allowed. 

b.    Townhouse Driveway Dimensions (Attached Single Family on Individual Lots in UV-SF):

(1)    Each standard lot with driveway access from a street, woonerf, or similar facility except an alley shall provide a driveway which has an eighteen (18) foot minimum length. Maximum driveway width for a single car width shall be no more than ten (10) feet and for a double car width shall be no more than sixteen (16) feet; however, the driveway shall be no greater than sixty-seven (67) percent of the lot or unit width. Where driveway parking is not needed or possible, driveways shall be limited to eight (8) feet or less in length, and use other techniques which communicate that parking on the driveway apron is prohibited.

(2)    Where a townhouse has alley access, all vehicular access to the townhouse must be from the alley. Driveways from alleys must have an eighteen (18) foot minimum length where parking is desired, and shall be limited to four (4) feet or less in length where parking is prohibited.

c.    Materials: Driveways shall not be asphalt; acceptable materials include concrete, exposed aggregate, and pavers. 

3.    Garages:

a.    Garages which face a circulation facility with a pedestrian component shall have a maximum width of fifty (50) percent of the overall building width, unless the building’s facade is less than thirty-six (36) feet wide. On building facades (attached or detached) less than thirty-six (36) feet in width, facing a street or circulation facility whose facade includes both a front door and a garage, the width allotted to the garage should be minimized, and the width devoted to the front door and living space should be maximized; however, in no case shall the front door and the space on either side of it be less than six (6) feet in width. In addition, other elements that emphasize the presence and importance of the front door shall include weather protection, lighting, landscape, special paving, etc.

b.    Garages must be sized to accommodate the required on-site number of standard-sized parking stalls, waste containers, and storage. Room for containers to hold three (3) waste streams shall be provided inside the garage. 

c.    In all cases, the presence of the garage shall be minimized from the street, woonerf, or similar facilities, which have a pedestrian component. Garages shall be set back a minimum of five (5) feet behind the front exterior walls of the residential living space and use elements such as overhangs (e.g., living spaces, terraces, trellises) to shade the garage doors to minimize their presence. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.250 Woonerf standards.

A.    Purpose and Intent: “Woonerf” is a Dutch term which means a circulation area shared by pedestrians, wheeled users and vehicles, and accessible to surrounding uses. While pedestrians and vehicles mingle, the pedestrian, rather than the vehicle, is accorded the dominant role. Special layout and street furniture emphasize the prime function of the area as being a place for people. Driving speed is reduced to walking speed, and parking is allowed only in designated areas. Woonerfs are located in areas where urban space is encouraged to extend into the street. Elements of woonerfs may vary depending on the abutting uses. Access and use provisions shall be the same as those pertaining to public or private streets.

B.    General Requirements: The following special requirements shall apply to woonerfs:

1.    Woonerf designs shall accommodate vehicles but emphasize pedestrian use.

2.    Paving materials shall not include asphalt. Concrete, stamped concrete, pavers, or other durable materials which will support vehicular loads may be proposed for use.

3.    The entrance(s) shall be clearly signed with “pedestrians have right of way” or other approved signage. The entrance will also be distinguished by a driveway cut (see Chapter 18.19A IMC, Section 6.4.K for the appropriate standard) and other changes such as surface materials or grade.

4.    Woonerfs are designed with an inverted crown. No curbs may be used except in special circumstances:

a.    Adjacent to parking;

b.    Where surrounding grades cannot accommodate inverted crown drainage; or

c.    As approved by the Director. 

    Where curbs are approved, all curbs shall be vertical; no extruded curbs are allowed.

5.    With the review of site work, landscape, and/or building permits, houses fronting on any woonerf shall limit height or presence of elements (e.g., walls, landscaping) directly abutting the woonerf that would inhibit drivers and pedestrians (especially small children) exiting lots from seeing each other.

6.    A clear area of at least two (2) feet in depth shall be provided on the lot, so that emerging drivers or pedestrians can see and be seen by approaching traffic. This shall be provided in front of any adjacent entrances to dwellings, businesses, or garages, where potential pedestrian/vehicular conflicts may occur, and ensure adequate sightlines and landings. 

7.    Where parallel parking is allowed, it may be incorporated where there are uses that would use and benefit from its presence. No head-in or angled parking is allowed. The parking will be located on the side of the woonerf without curb cuts to maximize the number of available parking stalls. Parking areas, if provided, shall be clearly recognizable and parking spaces shall meet the dimensional requirements of Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 8 (Parking).

8.    Traffic calming devices shall be provided as necessary to reduce driving speed to walking speed, taking into consideration emergency services access needs and in consultation with the Fire Marshal. 

9.    Pedestrian and vehicular routes shall not be differentiated by curbs or striping.

10.    The woonerf shall be sufficiently well lit after dark to enable drivers to see potential obstacles such as changes in level, and for drivers and pedestrians to see each other. See Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 17 (Lighting).

11.    A woonerf may serve up to twenty-nine (29) homes. More intense uses require further analysis and approval by the Director.

12.    A five (5) foot easement shall be provided on each side of the woonerf to accommodate street trees and other landscape to benefit the pedestrian and ensure the trees are protected. This may be reduced if the side yard of a lot is adjacent to one (1) or both sides of the woonerf. In that case a three (3) foot landscape easement is required on each side, between the edge of the woonerf and any fencing on the private lot. Front door walkways and driveways may cross the easement to access each residence.

13.    Dead-end woonerfs, where a fire truck turnaround is not required, shall provide a method for private vehicles to turn around, such as easements on driveways, hammerheads, etc., as acceptable to the Director. 

14.    Public utilities associated with dead-end woonerfs shall be designed so that City maintenance vehicles do not have to enter the woonerf to maintain City utilities.

15.    Public utilities which are owned and maintained by the City and which are located on dead-end woonerfs shall be designed so that City maintenance vehicles do not have to enter the woonerf to maintain the City utilities.

16.    Woonerfs shall be privately owned and maintained. 

C.    Woonerf Standards: There are three (3) configurations of woonerf that may be constructed. See Figure 5, below.

1.    Type 1: woonerf with through traffic or fire turnaround:

a.    Two (2) ten (10) foot travel lanes;

b.    Seven (7) foot parking one (1) or both sides (optional).

2.    Type 2: dead-end, more than three (3) residences:

a.    Eighteen (18) feet wide;

b.    Maximum length shall be determined in consultation with the Fire Marshal based on whether fire trucks may enter and the distance a fire hose may be pulled;

c.    Parallel parking may be allowed within the woonerf with extra width of eight (8) feet and if there is no impact to emergency service access needs.

3.    Type 3: dead-end, limited to three (3) residences:

a.    Fifteen (15) feet wide;

b.    Maximum length shall be determined in consultation with the Fire Marshal based on whether fire trucks will enter and the distance a fire hose may be pulled;

c.    No parking is allowed within the woonerf.

18.19C.260 Home occupations standards.

A.    Home occupations are permitted in Talus. A business license issued from the City shall be required and the type of business shall be as described in IMC 18.07.470. Additional business types not listed in the IMC shall be allowed subject to approval by the Director, and determined by:

1.    Client parking demand;

2.    Nuisance characteristics (e.g., air emission, vibration, noise, heat, light and glare); and

3.    Conformance with the home occupation criteria listed below.

B.    Home occupations shall meet all of the following criteria:

1.    Number of employees: maximum one (1) person from outside the residential unit.

2.    Gross floor area: no maximum.

3.    Signs:

a.    Nameplate as allowed by Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 9.

b.    Where there are ground-related residential units on streets designated for sidewalk use in Chapter 12.05 IMC, legal and permitted home occupations may choose to add a pedestrian-oriented sign as regulated by Chapter 18.19A IMC, Chapter 9, as an additional sign for home occupation.

4.    Outside storage or display: none permitted.

5.    Off-street parking: none required (except as required for residential use).

6.    Deliveries to site: permitted; provided, that the quantity of deliveries and the type of delivery vehicle do not negatively impact the neighborhood in which the home occupation is located.

7.    Customers: maximum one (1) customer vehicle at any given time.

8.    Other Requirements:

a.    Owner/operator of the home occupation must reside on site;

b.    Business area will not be counted towards zoning cap in the overlay. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.270 Processing of applications including adjustments and modifications of standards.

A.    Adjustment of Standards: Any revisions not specifically excluded by subsection F of this section (Council Modifications), or Chapter 18.19A IMC (Section 1.1(E)), may be approved by the Director. The criteria and process for review are in Chapter 18.19A IMC. 

B.    Commission Review of Certain Land Use Permits as Established by Chapter 18.19A IMC or This Title: Following the termination of a development agreement, where review of subsequent permits is required to be at a Commission, the review will occur at the Development Commission. 

C.    Preliminary Plats and Required Community Conference:

1.    Following determination that a complete submittal for preliminary plat has been received, City staff shall schedule a community conference with the Development Commission, unless another commission or board has reason to hold a meeting for this project. Then that commission or board would hold the community conference, e.g., Rivers and Streams Board.

2.    The community conference is an informal public meeting hosted by the Commission. The purpose of the community conference is to generate discussion, raise issues, and propose creative options relative to the proposed preliminary plat. It is intended to provide a means by which the applicant, staff, the Commission, and the public work together in a productive and creative manner to initially review the proposal’s compliance with the Comprehensive Plan; this chapter, replacement regulations; and, as applicable: Chapter 18.19A IMC, CIDDS; and the IMC. 

3.    Following the community conference, staff with the assistance of the applicant (if they choose) will prepare a community conference response memo. The memo will summarize topics, concerns, and opportunities raised at the community conference; review them within the context of the proposal and applicable codes; provide responses from staff and the applicant (if they choose to respond); and provide a conclusion for each topic as to what should or should not happen relative to the proposal and applicable codes.

4.    The community conference response memo will be provided to parties of record and the Development Commission. They will be given a two (2) week comment period in which to provide additional comment as to the content and responses contained in the memo. 

5.    If consistent with Code, any further comments received shall be incorporated into the community conference response memo, and applied either as corrections to the plat drawings or proposed conditions of approval.

6.    The final community conference response memo shall be an attachment to the Hearing Examiner staff report.

D.    Thresholds Triggering a Site Development Permit Review: A site development permit or Level 3 review is required for those development proposals or uses with any one (1) or more of the following characteristics:

1.    The site is equal to or greater than three (3) gross acres.

2.    The proposed building(s) on a site are equal to or greater than forty-five thousand (45,000) square feet of gross floor area.

3.    The site’s primary access and/or street frontage are located on and/or the site abuts one (1) or more of the following streets: NW Talus Dr.

E.    Subdivision of Land or Adjustment of Property Boundaries and Changes to the Overlay or Zoning Cap: Property covered by these replacement regulations and which chooses to subdivide their land or adjust their property lines would have their overlay or zoning cap distributed as follows:

1.    Single Family Lots (UV-SF): Lots may be subdivided or adjusted, but the overlay or zoning cap may not be subdivided. This would result in a lot without the right to build an additional unit.

2.    Nonresidential Overlay or Zoning Cap: Parcels which are subdivided or adjust their property lines subsequent to the adoption of the replacement regulations would have their zoning cap divided between the old and new lots at the discretion of the property owner(s) as long as at no time the resulting zoning cap would cause the property’s development capacity to fall below the minimum FAR (floor area ratio).

3.    Multifamily or Mixed Use Residential Overlay or Zoning Cap: Parcels which are subdivided or adjust their property lines subsequent to the adoption of the replacement regulations would have their zoning cap divided between the old and new lots at the discretion of the property owner(s) as long as at no time the resulting zoning cap would cause the property’s development capacity to fall below the minimum density. The minimum residential densities are:

a.    Low density: three (3) dwelling units per acre;

b.    Medium density: thirteen (13) dwelling units per acre;

c.    High density: twenty-three (23) dwelling units per acre.

Note: See Figure 1, Talus Land Use Map, for Talus density assignments.

4.    The same principles would apply to mixed use parcels, although the resulting parcels are not required to be mixed use after subdivision.

5.    Segregation of the property, resulting in parcels without entitlement, is allowed only if the resulting parcel is used for a purpose not requiring a zoning cap, e.g., parking, stormwater vault, plaza. 

    During the land use permit review process for subdividing (e.g., short plat or long subdivision) or adjusting property lines (e.g., lot line adjustment), staff will review the division of the zoning cap per the above criteria. With approval of the subdivision or property line adjustment, Figure 2 would be administratively updated to reflect the changes.

F.    Council Modifications: The following changes must be decided by the City Council following a review and recommendation from either the Planning Policy or Development Commission, as determined by the Director. The process for reviewing the proposed Council modifications shall follow Chapter 18.04 IMC, Level 6 review process.

1.    Changes to zoning shown in Figure 2, or as described in IMC 18.19C.130.

2.    Changes to the overlay or zoning cap shown in Figure 2 except as allowed in subsection E of this section.

3.    The inclusion of any land uses in IMC 18.19C.130 which the Director determines are outside the scope of IMC 18.19C.040.

4.    Increases in building heights from those specified in IMC 18.19C.140.

5.    Removal or reduction in size of parks, plazas, or informal gathering areas where they are shown on the following: Figure 3. 

6.    Removal or reduction of trails in existence as of the date of adoption of this chapter, including those shown on Figure 4. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).


18.19C.280 Vesting of permits. 

A.    Only vesting established by Washington State law shall apply to the vesting of development applications for properties located within Talus previously covered by the terminated development agreements. These are: 

1.    Building permits which comply with RCW 19.27.095; or

2.    Long or short plats which comply with RCW 58.17.033; or

3.    Development agreements per RCW 36.70B.180. (Ord. 2840 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018).

18.20.030 Nomination procedure. 

A.    Any person, including the Historic Preservation Officer and any member of the Commission, may nominate an historic resource for designation as a landmark. The procedures set forth in this section and IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, may be used to amend existing designations or to terminate an existing designation based on changes which affect the applicability of the criteria for designation set forth in IMC 18.20.020, Designation criteria. The nomination or designation of an historic resource as a landmark shall constitute nomination or designation of the land which is occupied by the historic resource unless the nomination provides otherwise. Nominations shall be made on official nomination forms provided by the Historic Preservation Officer, shall be filed with the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall include all data required by the Commission. 

B.    Upon receipt by the Historic Preservation Officer of any nomination for designation, the officer shall review the nomination, consult with the person or persons submitting the nomination, and the owner, and prepare any amendments to or additional information on the nomination deemed necessary by the officer. The Historic Preservation Officer may refuse to accept any nomination for which inadequate information is provided by the person or persons submitting the nomination. It is the responsibility of the person or persons submitting the nomination to perform such research as is necessary for consideration by the Commission. The Historic Preservation Officer may assume responsibility for gathering the required information or appoint an expert or experts to carry out this research in the interest of expediting the consideration.

C.    When the Historic Preservation Officer is satisfied that the nomination contains sufficient information and complies with the Commission’s regulations for nomination, the officer shall give notice in writing, certified mail/return receipt requested, to the owner of the property or object, to the person submitting the nomination and interested persons of record that a preliminary or a designation determination on the nomination will be made by the Commission.

No nomination shall be considered by the Commission less than thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45) calendar days after notice setting the hearing date has been mailed except where the Historic Preservation Officer or members of the Commission have reason to believe that immediate action is necessary to prevent destruction, demolition or defacing of an historic resource, in which case the notice setting the hearing shall so state. (Ord. 2319 § 1, 2001).


18.20.040 Designation procedure. 

A.    The Commission may approve, deny, amend or terminate the designation of an historic resource as a landmark only after a public hearing. At the designation hearing the commission shall receive evidence and hear argument only on the issues of whether the historic resource meets the criteria for designation of landmarks as specified in IMC 18.20.020, Designation criteria, and merits designation as a landmark; and the significant features of the landmark. The hearing may be continued from time to time in the discretion of the Commission. In the event the hearing is continued, the commission may make a preliminary determination of significance if the commission determines, based on the record before it that the historic resource is of significant value and likely to satisfy the criteria for designation set out in IMC 18.20.020, Designation criteria. Such preliminary determination shall be effective as of the date of the public hearing at which it is made. Where the Commission makes a preliminary determination it shall specify the boundaries of the nominated resource, the significant features thereof, and such other description of the historic resource as it deems appropriate. Within five (5) working days after the Commission has made a preliminary determination, the Historic Preservation Officer shall file a written notice of such action with the manager and mail copies of the same, certified mail/return receipt requested, to the owner, the person submitting the nomination and interested persons of record. Such notice shall include:

1.    A copy of the Commission’s preliminary determination;

2.    A statement that while proceedings pursuant to this chapter are pending, or six (6) months from the date of the notice, whichever is shorter, and thereafter if the designation is approved by the Commission, the Certificate of Appropriateness procedures set out in IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, a copy of which shall be enclosed, shall apply to the described historic resource whether or not a Building Permit or other permit is required. The decision of the Commission shall be made after the close of the public hearing or at the next regularly scheduled public meeting of the Commission thereafter.

B.    Whenever the Commission approves the designation of an historic resource under consideration for designation as a landmark, it shall, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the public meeting at which the decision is made, issue a written designation report which shall include:

1.    The boundaries of the nominated resource and such other description of the resource sufficient to identify its ownership and location;

2.    The significant features and such other information concerning the historic resource as the Commission deems appropriate;

3.    Findings of fact and reasons supporting the designation with specific reference to the criteria for designation set forth in IMC 18.20.020, Designation criteria;

4.    A statement that no significant feature may be changed, whether or not a building or other permit is required, without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission pursuant to the provisions of IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, a copy of which shall be included in the designation report.

C.    Whenever the Commission rejects the nomination of an historic resource under consideration for designation as a landmark, it shall, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the public meeting at which the decision is made, issue a written decision including findings of fact and reasons supporting its determination that the criteria set forth in IMC 18.20.020, Designation criteria, have not been met. Nothing contained herein shall prevent renominating any historic resource rejected under this subsection as an Issaquah landmark at a future time.

D.    A copy of the Commission’s designation report or decision rejecting a nomination shall be delivered or mailed to the owner, to interested persons of record and the director within five (5) working days after it is issued. If the Commission rejects the nomination and it has made a preliminary determination of significance with respect to such nomination, it shall include in the notice to the Director a statement that the provisions of IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, no longer apply to the subject historic resources.

E.    If the Commission approves, or amends a landmark designation, the provisions of IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, shall apply as approved or amended. A copy of the Commission’s designation report or designation amendment shall be filed with the division of records and elections together with a legal description of the designated resource and notification that the provisions of IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, and IMC 18.20.080, Penalty for violation of IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure. If the Commission terminates the designation of an historic resource, the provisions of IMC 18.20.050, Certificate of Appropriateness procedure, shall no longer apply to said historic resource. (Ord. 2319 § 1, 2001).


18.20.050 Certificate of Appropriateness procedure. 

A.    At any time after a designation report and notice has been filed with the Director and for a period of six (6) months after notice of a preliminary determination of significance has been mailed to the owner and filed with the director, a Certificate of Appropriateness must be obtained from the Commission before any alterations may be made to the significant features of the landmark identified in the preliminary determination report or thereafter in the designation report. The designation report shall supersede the preliminary determination report. This requirement shall apply whether or not the proposed alteration also requires a Building Permit or other permit.

B.    Ordinary repairs and maintenance which do not alter the appearance of a significant feature and do not utilize substitute materials do not require a Certificate of Appropriateness. Repairs to or replacement of utility systems do not require a Certificate of Appropriateness; provided, that such work does not alter an exterior significant feature.

C.    There shall be three (3) types of certificates of appropriateness, as follows:

1.    Type I, for restorations and major repairs which utilize in-kind materials.

2.    Type II, for alterations in appearance, replacement of historic materials and new construction.

3.    Type III, for demolition and moving of buildings and structures, and excavation of archaeological sites.

a.    In addition, the Commission shall establish and adopt an appeals process concerning Type I decisions made by the Historic Preservation Officer with respect to the applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.

b.    The Historic Preservation Officer may approve Type I Certificates of Appropriateness administratively without public hearing, subject to procedures adopted by the Commission. Alternatively, the Historic Preservation Officer may refer applications for Type I Certificates of Appropriateness to the Commission for decision. The Commission shall adopt an appeals procedure concerning Type I decisions made by the Historic Preservation Officer. Type II and III Certificates of Appropriateness shall be decided by the Commission and the following general procedures shall apply to such Commission actions:

(1)    Application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be made by filing an application for such certificate with the Historic Preservation Officer on forms provided by the Commission, available at the City Permit Center.

(2)    If an application is made to the Director for a permit for any action which affects a landmark, the Director shall promptly refer such application to the Historic Preservation Officer, and such application shall be deemed an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness if accompanied by the additional information required to apply for such certificate. The Director may continue to process such permit application, but shall not issue any such permit until the time has expired for filing with the Director the notice of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness or a Certificate of Appropriateness has been issued pursuant to this chapter.

(3)    After the Commission has commenced proceedings for the consideration of any application for a Certificate of Appropriateness by giving notice of a hearing pursuant to IMC 18.20.030(C), no other application for the same or a similar alteration may be made until such proceedings and all administrative appeals therefrom pursuant to this chapter have been concluded.

(4)    Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the filing of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness with the Commission or the referral of an application to the Commission by the Director except those decided administratively by the Historic Preservation Officer pursuant to subsection (C)(3)(b) of this section, the Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon. The Historic Preservation Officer shall mail notice of the hearing to the owner, the applicant, if the applicant is not the owner, and parties of record at the designation proceedings, not less than ten (10) calendar days before the date of the hearing. No hearing shall be required if the Commission, the owner and the applicant, if the applicant is not the owner, agree in writing to a stipulated certificate approving the requested alterations thereof. This agreement shall be ratified by the Commission in a public meeting and reflected in the Commission meeting minutes. If the Commission grants a Certificate of Appropriateness, such certificate shall be issued forthwith and the Historic Preservation Officer shall promptly file a copy of such certificate with the Director.

(5)    If the Commission denies the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, in whole or in part, it shall so notify the owner, the person submitting the application, the Director and interested persons of record setting forth the reasons why approval of the application is not warranted.

D.    The Commission shall adopt such other supplementary procedures consistent with Chapter 18.03 IMC, Administration, as it determines are required to carry out the intent of this section. (Ord. 2319 § 1, 2001).

A.    At the public hearing on any application for a Type II or Type III Certificate of Appropriateness, or Type I if referred to the Commission by the Historic Preservation Officer, the Commission shall, when requested by the property owner, consider evidence of the economic impact on the owner of the denial or partial denial of a certificate. In no case may a certificate be denied, in whole or in part, when it is established that the denial or partial denial will, when available incentives are utilized, deprive the owner of a reasonable economic use of the landmark and there is no viable and reasonable alternative which would have less impact on the features of significance specified in the preliminary determination report or the designation report.

B.    To prove the existence of a condition of unreasonable economic return, the applicant must establish and the Commission must find, both of the following:

18.21.010 Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the goals and policies adopted in the Comprehensive Plan to provide housing opportunities for all economic groups. It is also the purpose of this chapter to:

A.    Ensure a portion of the housing provided in the City is affordable housing;

B.    Create an affordable housing program that may be used with other local housing incentives authorized by the City Council, such as a multifamily tax exemption program, and other public and private resources to promote affordable housing;

C.    Use increased development capacity in certain zones, including the urban core, to create voluntary and/or mandatory programs for affordable housing. (Ord. 2664 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2012).


18.21.020 Definitions.

Certain words, terms and phrases used in this chapter of the Issaquah Land Use Code are defined below. If any of these definitions conflict with definitions used in other chapters of the Municipal Code, the definitions herein shall prevail when used in the context of this chapter. Other terms used in this chapter may be defined in Chapter 18.02 IMC.

A.    Affordable Housing: A dwelling unit reserved for occupancy by eligible households and having housing expenses no greater than thirty (30) percent of a given percent of the King County median household income, adjusted for household size, as follows:

Low income affordable housing: Renter-occupied housing affordable to a household earning fifty (50) percent of the King County median income, adjusted for household size, or owner-occupied housing affordable to a household earning sixty (60) percent of King County median income, adjusted for household size.

Low-moderate income affordable housing: Renter-occupied housing affordable to a household earning sixty (60) percent of the King County median income, adjusted for household size, or owner-occupied housing affordable to a household earning seventy (70) percent of King County median income, adjusted for household size.

Mid-moderate income affordable housing: Renter-occupied housing affordable to a household earning seventy (70) percent of the King County median income, adjusted for household size, or owner-occupied housing affordable to a household earning eighty (80) percent of King County median income, adjusted for household size.

Moderate income affordable housing: Renter-occupied housing affordable to a household earning eighty (80) percent of the King County median income, adjusted for household size, or owner-occupied housing affordable to a household earning ninety (90) percent of King County median income, adjusted for household size.

Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that the higher income levels specified in the definition of affordable housing in this chapter, rather than those stated in the definition of “low income households” in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions in the City.

“King County median income” means the median income for the Seattle-Bellevue, WA HUD Metro FMR Area (King County) as most recently determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under Section 8(f)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. In the event such income determination is no longer published by HUD, the City may use or develop such other reasonable method as it may choose in order to determine the King County median income.

B.    Household Income: Includes all income that would be included as income for federal income tax purposes (e.g. wages, interest income, etc.) from all household members over the age of eighteen (18) that reside in the dwelling unit for more than three (3) months of the year. 

C.    Housing Expenses, Ownership Housing: Includes mortgage and mortgage insurance, property taxes, property insurances and homeowner’s dues.

D.    Housing Expenses, Rental Housing: Includes rent and appropriate utility allowance.

E.    Median Income: The median income for the Seattle MSA as most recently determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under Section 8(f)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. In the event that HUD no longer publishes median income figures for the Seattle MSA or King County, the Director may estimate the King County median income, adjusted for household size in such manner as the Director shall determine.

F.    Housing Receiving Site: The off-site location of affordable housing required of a sending site.

G.    Housing Sending Site: The location of the project triggering affordable housing requirements. (Ord. 2832 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 2746 § 6 (Exh. C), 2015; Ord. 2664 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2012).


18.21.030 Affordable housing programs.

The following provisions shall apply to all affordable housing units required by, or allowed through, any provisions of the Issaquah Municipal Code:

A.    The City provides various incentives and other public resources to promote affordable housing. Specific regulations providing for affordable housing are described below:

	Location	Use	Targeted Affordability Level *	Mandatory or Voluntary Program	Applicable Code Section

	Central Issaquah: Urban Core; Vertical Mixed Use Overlay; and Mixed Use Zone	Residential	Low Income to Mid-Moderate Income Affordable Housing	Mandatory	Chapter 4.0, Zoning Districts, Uses and Standards Summary, Central Issaquah Development Standards, Chapter 18.21 IMC, Affordable Housing

	Development Agreement with Affordable Housing Provisions	Terms of the Development Agreement

* Refer to applicable code section to see if alternative affordability levels are allowed.

B.    Any affordable housing units created through the provisions described in this section shall also comply with the provisions of IMC 18.21.040 and 18.21.050, unless otherwise specifically exempted or addressed by the applicable code section for specific incentive programs. (Ord. 2832 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 2664 § 3 (Exh. A2), 2012).


18.21.040 General affordable housing requirements.

The following provisions shall apply to all affordable housing units required by, or created through, any incentive established in the Issaquah Municipal Code unless otherwise specifically exempted or addressed by the applicable code section for specific affordable housing programs or by the provisions of an approved development agreement:

A.    Duration: Affordable housing units shall remain affordable for a minimum of fifty (50) years from the date of initial owner occupancy for ownership affordable housing and for the life of the project for rental affordable housing. At the sole discretion of the Director a shorter affordability time period, not to be less than thirty (30) years, may be approved for ownership affordable housing units in order to meet federal financial underwriting guidelines.

B.    Designation of Affordable Housing Units: The Director shall review and approve the location and unit mix of the affordable housing units, consistent with the following standards, prior to the issuance of any building permit:

    This notification shall be part of a complete submittal by the applicant.

1.    The notice shall include a description of the proposed installation, including the proposed dimensions, design, color, type of facility, proposed location and identification of alternative locations that would meet project objectives. In lieu of providing all of this information as part of the notice, the applicant may produce a webpage containing this information and direct residents to its location.

2.    A rendering of the proposed facility shall be included in the notification.

3.    Network provider shall provide the City with a distribution list of property owners and a copy of the materials distributed.

E.    Consolidated Permit:

1.    Small wireless facility sites may be consolidated into one (1) permit application for processing. If the sites within the consolidated permit have differing review timelines, the longer timeline will apply to review of the consolidated grouping of sites. The process in IMC 18.04.160 (Consolidated permit review process) shall not apply to the consolidated permit review of small wireless facilities.

2.    A network provider may elect to apply for a land use permit and a building permit as a consolidated application. The network provider acknowledges the building permit submittal is an at-risk permit and is dependent upon receiving the land use permit. (Ord. 2867 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 2833 § 3, 2018).


18.22.080 Fees.

A.    A permit fee shall be required to be paid in accordance with the City of Issaquah’s adopted fee schedule. The fee shall cover Development Services staff time for plan review, public communication, inspection, and administration. (Ord. 2867 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 2833 § 3, 2018).

    The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the City under this section, does not support or house equipment described in subsections (A)(1)(a) and (b) of this section.

2.    Collocation: The mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communication purposes.

3.    Eligible facilities request: Any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially increase the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving:

a.    Collocation of new transmission equipment;

b.    Removal of transmission equipment; or

c.    Replacement of transmission equipment.

4.    Eligible support structure: Any tower or base station as defined in this section; provided, that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the City.

5.    Existing: A constructed tower or base station is existing if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process; provided, that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.

6.    Substantial change: A modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria:

a.    For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than ten (10) percent or by the height of one (1) additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna, not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than ten (10) percent or more than ten (10) feet, whichever is greater.

(1)    Changes in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act;

b.    For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than ten (10) feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six (6) feet;

c.    For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or, for towers in the public streets and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than ten (10) percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure;

d.    It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;

e.    It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or

f.    It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified above.

B.    Application: The designated official shall prepare and make publicly available an application form used to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification.

C.    Qualification as an eligible facilities request: Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request, the designated official shall review such application to determine whether the application qualifies as an eligible facilities request.

E.    Tolling of the time frame for review: The sixty (60) day review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement by the designated official and the applicant or in cases where the designated official determines that the application is incomplete. The time frame for review of an eligible facilities request is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.

1.    To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the designated official shall provide written notice to the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application.

2.    The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the designated official’s notice of incompleteness.

3.    Following a supplemental submission, the designated official will notify the applicant within ten (10) days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this subsection. Second or subsequent notice of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.

F.    Determination that application is not an eligible facilities request: If the designated official determines that the applicant’s request does not qualify as an eligible facilities request, the designated official shall deny the application.

G.    Failure to Act: In the event the designated official fails to approve or deny a request for an eligible facilities request within the time frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the designated official in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. (Ord. 2867 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 2833 § 3, 2018).
