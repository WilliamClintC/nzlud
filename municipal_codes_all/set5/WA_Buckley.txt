The voluntary correction agreement is a contract between the city and the person responsible for the violation under which that person agrees to abate the violation within a specified time and according to specified conditions.

(5) Extension – Modification.

Any employee against whom disciplinary action has been taken may, within 10 days of receiving written notice of the disciplinary action, request a hearing before the commission. The request must be in writing and a copy must be given to the appointing authority, as well as a copy to the secretary and chief examiner or a commission member within the 10-day period. If the written request is not timely served then the right to a hearing shall be deemed waived. Upon receiving a timely notice for a hearing, the commission shall schedule the hearing in due course. All hearings shall be open to the public unless the employee in his notice for hearing requests that the meeting be closed to the public. The employee is entitled to be represented by counsel at the hearing, at his own expense. The purpose of the hearing shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether the disciplinary action was taken for cause. The commission shall hear such testimony as is necessary in order to determine whether cause existed. The aggrieved employee shall have the right to testify before the commission. If the commission finds that there was cause for disciplinary action, but not for such a severe action as was taken, then the commission may impose a less severe sanction; provided, however, if the employee has been previously demoted, and the present disciplinary action is a demotion or discharge, then the commission, in their review, may not modify the order of discharge or demotion, but may only determine whether there was cause for the disciplinary action.

(7) Acceptance for personal use of a fee, gift, or other valuable thing in the course of work, when given in the hope or expectation of receiving a favor or better treatment than that accorded the public generally;

Failure to so comply, by the employee, shall be entered on the service record of the employee and may be cause for denying future employment by the city. The resignation of an employee who fails to give notice shall be reported by the appointing authority or department head immediately. (Ord. 21-15 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1055 § 18, 1983).

No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and any procedures established by the finance director. The finance director shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. The finance director is authorized to determine investable balances in each fund and is authorized to invest such monies in a manner consistent with this policy and applicable law, without prior council approval of any specific investment. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014; Ord. 718 § 1, 1966). 


3.20.020 Investment objectives.

(1) The primary objectives, in priority order, of the city’s investment activities shall be:

(a) Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the city of Buckley’s investment policy. Investments of the city shall be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of the amount invested.

(b) Liquidity. The city’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all reasonably anticipated operating requirements.

(c) Return on Investment. The city’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the protection of principal and state statutes.

(2) Rate speculation will not be a major criterion for the selection of an investment. All other criteria, including cash flow and maturity, take preference to rate expectations. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.030 Policy.

It is the policy of the city of Buckley to invest public funds in a manner which safeguards and protects the principal of the city’s investments, provide liquidity in meeting daily cash flow and provide the highest return possible while conforming to all Washington statutes governing the investment of public funds. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).

(1) Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of capital as well as the probable income to be derived.

(2) The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the “prudent person” and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.060 Investment committee.

An investment committee will be established consisting of the finance director, city administrator and the council finance committee appointees. The committee will meet no less than quarterly and will be established to serve in a general review and advisory capacity, taking into account the city’s investment objectives, available funds and current market conditions. In addition to reviewing periodic reports from the finance director detailing, but not limited to, the following: current value of the portfolio, rate of return percentages by type and institution, term length of investments, and average rate of return, the committee will also certify the acceptability of brokers/dealers with which the city may do business. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.070 Ethics and conflicts of interest.

Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials responsible for investment transactions shall disclose to the mayor any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within this jurisdiction. They shall further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the city’s portfolio. Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the city of Buckley, particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.080 Authorized financial dealers and institutions.

(1) The finance director will maintain a list of financial institutions and security dealers authorized to provide investment services to the city if applicable. These may include both primary and secondary dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-I (uniform net capital rule) and investment departments of local banks who maintain an office in the state of Washington. In addition, the current financial statements for each institution will be kept on file, following a review by the city’s investment committee to determine financial condition, strength and capability to fulfill commitments.

(2) Institutional investment staffs shall be trained in precautions appropriate to state of Washington local government investment laws and required to familiarize themselves with the city’s investment objectives, policies and constraints. Each institution so designated will sign an agreement stating that they have received and read a copy of this investment policy and will offer only investments as authorized under this document.

(3) No public deposit shall be made except in a qualified public depository located in the state of Washington. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).

3.20.100 Fund investment and interest allocations.

Investments shall be made with excess funds and the interest earnings will be distributed as follows:

(1) Funds determined by the finance director to be available for investment may be invested on an individual fund basis and may be adjusted monthly to meet cash flow purposes of individual funds or may, unless otherwise restricted by law, be commingled within one common fund called the treasury account. Funds may also be commingled into common investment portfolios.

(2) Interest earnings, derived from investments of excess and inactive funds commingled into the treasury account or common investment portfolios and attributable to the following restricted funds, shall be apportioned to each listed fund: EMS Fund 105, Fire Station Construction Bond Fund 202, Cemetery Endowment Care Fund 301, Stormwater Construction Fund 306, Water/Sewer Operations Fund 402, Solid Waste Fund 403, Sewer Construction Fund 405 and Water Construction Fund 406.

(3) After investment income attributable to the above listed restricted funds has been properly apportioned, the remainder of the investment income shall be used for the benefit of the general fund of the city.

(4) Funds derived from the sale of general obligation bonds or revenue bonds or similar instruments of indebtedness shall be invested, or used in such manner as the initiating ordinances, resolutions, or bond covenants may lawfully prescribe. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.110 Safekeeping and custody.

(Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.120 Diversification.

Diversification is preferred by the city to reduce overall portfolio risks while attaining market average rates of return. Diversification by institution, type of investment security and years to maturity may be employed to avoid overconcentration in any of the aforementioned areas. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.130 Maturities.

(1) To the extent possible, unless matched to a specific cash flow, the city will attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the city will maintain a portfolio with an average life not to exceed 10 years.

(2) The city may sell securities, if deemed appropriate, to maintain liquidity. Such actions must be initiated by the investment officer, not the brokers or dealers.

(3) No transaction needs to be instituted when the maturity or call of a security causes the average life of the portfolio or maximum holdings per category to exceed their limits. Any transactions after such infractions shall work toward the return to compliance. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.140 Internal control.

The established process of independent review will be performed as required under state law by the state auditor’s office. This review will provide internal control by assuring that policies and procedures are being complied with. Such review may also result in recommendations to change operating procedures to improve internal control. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.150 Performance standards.

Given that the city of Buckley’s investment strategy is passive, the city’s investment portfolio will be designed to obtain a market average rate of return equal to or greater than that obtained by the State of Washington Local Government Investment Pool. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.160 Reporting.

The finance director shall submit quarterly investment reports to the city council finance committee that summarize the portfolio’s holdings and investments by type. The reports shall summarize the portfolio’s current value of the portfolio, rate of return percentages by type and institution, term length of investments, and average rate of return. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).


3.20.170 Savings clause.

(1) In the event any state or federal legislation or regulation should further restrict instruments or institutions authorized by this policy, such restrictions shall be deemed to be immediately incorporated into this policy.

(2) If new legislation or regulation should liberalize the permitted instruments or institutions, such changes shall be available and included in this policy only after written notification to the city council and their subsequent approval of said changes. (Ord. 14-14 § 1, 2014).

3.50.035 Assessment of impact fees.

(1) The city shall collect impact fees, based on the provisions of BMC 3.50.040 through 3.50.060, or an independent transportation fee calculation as provided for in BMC 3.50.070, from any applicant seeking development approval from the city for any development activity within the city, where such development activity requires the issuance of a building or occupancy permit. This shall include, but is not limited to, the development of residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial land, and includes the expansion of existing uses that creates a demand for additional public facilities, as well as a change in existing use that creates a demand for additional public facilities.

(2) Where a change in use triggers review under the State Environmental Policy Act or increases the trip generation by more than five percent or 10 peak hour trips, whichever is less, the director shall calculate a transportation impact fee based on the increases in the trip generation rate.

(3) Impact fees shall be assessed at the time the complete building permit application is submitted for each unit in the development, using either the impact fee schedules then in effect or an independent transportation fee calculation as provided for in BMC 3.50.070. The city shall not accept an application for a building permit if final plat, PRD, or binding site plan approval is needed and has not yet been granted by the city. Furthermore, the city shall not accept an application for a building permit unless prior to submittal or concurrent with submittal, the feepayer submits complete applications for all other discretionary reviews needed, including, but not limited to, design review, the environmental determination, and the accompanying checklist.

(4) Applicants that have been awarded credits prior to the submittal of the complete building permit application pursuant to BMC 3.50.030 or 3.50.090, shall submit, along with the complete building permit application, a copy of the letter prepared by the director and/or designee setting forth the dollar amount of the credit awarded. Impact fees, as determined after the application of appropriate credits, shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued or prior to final building inspection as set forth in subsection (6) of this section.

(5) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the department shall not issue a building permit unless and until the impact fees required by this chapter, less any permitted exemptions, credits or deductions, have been paid.

(6) Impact fee payments may be deferred for single-family detached and attached residential construction until prior to the city conducting a final building inspection as authorized by RCW 82.02.020(3). All applicants and/or legal owners of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur must sign an impact fee deferral agreement in a form acceptable by the city attorney. The applicant will pay a $50.00 administrative fee, along with fees necessary for recording the agreement in the office of the Pierce County auditor. The impact fee deferral agreement shall require the applicant to grant and record an impact fee lien as required by RCW 82.02.020(3). The city shall withhold certification of final inspection, certificate of occupancy or equivalent final certification until the deferred impacts fees have been paid in full. The term of an impact fee deferral shall not exceed 18 months.

In the event that the fees are not paid within the time provided in this subsection, the city shall institute foreclosure proceedings under the process set forth in Chapter 61.12 RCW, except as revised herein, and also except that the city may elect to have the school district institute foreclosure proceedings for the collection of school impact fees as authorized by RCW 82.02.020(3). The then-present owner shall also pay the city’s reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in the foreclosure process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not commence foreclosure proceedings less than 30 calendar days prior to providing written notification to the then-present owner of the property via certified mail with return receipt requested advising of its intent to commence foreclosure proceedings. If the then-present owner cures the default within the 30-day cure period, no attorney fees and/or costs will be owed. In addition, the city retains its full authority to withhold inspections and to suspend, revoke or refuse to issue occupancy and other building permits and to commence enforcement actions due to non-payment of impact fees. (Ord. 02-16 § 1, 2016).


3.50.040 Impact fee for parks and recreation facilities.

The park and recreation impact fee imposed on residential development is based on the cost of capital projects listed in the parks, recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan. The parks and recreation impact fee imposed shall be that which is set forth in the parks impact fee calculation identified in the comprehensive plan. The fees shall be assessed and collected pursuant to BMC 3.50.035.

(1) Park and recreation impact fee shall be assessed to all new residential construction as follows:

	Type of Construction	Impact Fee per Dwelling Unit

	Single-family homes	$1,624.70

	Multiple-family residential	$1,331.52

(2) The park and recreation impact fees in subsection (1) of this section may be reviewed annually to consider adjustments to the fees to account for increased costs of labor, construction materials and real property. The city council intends that such review should occur concurrently with the annual review of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 02-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 25-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 16-04 § 1, 2004; Ord. 15-97 § 1, 1997).


3.50.050 Impact fee accounts for the White River School District.

(1) White River School District impact fees shall be submitted to the White River School District upon receipt. The fee shall be collected pursuant to BMC 3.50.035.

(a) White River School District impact fees shall be assessed to all new residential construction as follows:

	Type of Construction	WRSD Fee Calculation	Buckley Impact Fee/Dwelling Unit

	Single-family homes	$11,391	$3,770

	Multiple-family residential	$4,001	$2,000

(2) The school impact fee schedule set forth in subsection (1)(a) of this section reflects the legislative determination that while the full impact fees per dwelling unit accurately characterize the cost of the schools and school facilities required for each new development, as documented in the district’s capital facilities plan, the council has, as a matter of policy, decided to make a discretionary adjustment to the schedule. The council is authorized to reduce or to increase the adjustments as part of its annual review of the fee schedule, or at any other time, by adopting an amendatory ordinance. (Ord. 33-19 § 2, 2019; Ord. 02-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 05-10 § 1, 2010; Ord. 01-07 § 1, 2007; Ord. 25-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 15-97 § 1, 1997).


3.50.060 Impact fee for street facilities.

Street impact fees shall be deposited in the street construction fund. The fees shall be assessed and collected pursuant to BMC 3.50.035. The assessments shall be made in accordance with Appendix E of the 2016 City of Buckley Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element, a copy of which is attached to the ordinance codified in this section as Exhibit A. (Ord. 01-18 § 1, 2018; Ord. 02-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 25-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 20-98 § 1, 1998).


3.50.070 Alternative street facilities impact fee calculation.

The applicant may petition the planning director for an alternative calculation of the impact fee by providing evidence of a study more specifically related to the proposed use, warranting a different trip generation estimate than the trip generation numbers provided in Appendix E of the transportation element of the city of Buckley comprehensive plan. 

(1) The petition will be considered only if the proposed use is not specifically included in Appendix E, or if the applicant is able to show site-specific information warranting a reduction for pass-through traffic. 

(a) Pass-By Reductions. The daily weekday trips referenced in Appendix E exclude pass-by trips. Utilizing the ITE handbook, as now constituted or as hereafter amended or modified, an applicant can determine the pass-by trip reduction factor for a proposed use. The pass-by trip reduction factor reduces the average trip rate based on average pass-by trip percentages or a reduction for trips that would have traveled on a street adjacent to a new use, even if the new use was not constructed. Reduction rates vary by land use and factors such as building size and volume of adjacent street traffic. The following are examples of potential average pass-by trip percentages with their resulting pass-by trip reduction factors, which translate to a savings on the impact fee. These are examples only. The city will accept pass-by trip percentages as listed in the latest edition of the ITE handbook.

	Example Land Use	Example Average Pass-By Trip %	Example Pass-By Trip Reduction Factor

	Discount Supermarket (LU 854)	23%	0.77

	Shopping Center (LU 820)	34%	0.66

	Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window (LU 934)	50%	0.50

	Coffee/Donut Shop with Drive-Through Window and No Indoor Seating (LU 938)	89%	0.11

(2) If the planning director approves the petition, the applicant shall pay the alternative impact fee calculated by using the approved trip generation numbers multiplied by the fee per trip identified in the transportation element of the city of Buckley comprehensive plan, as now constituted or hereafter amended or modified, in lieu of the fees provided for in BMC 3.50.060. (Ord. 16-19 § 1, 2019; Ord. 01-18 § 2, 2018; Ord. 02-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 25-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 49-99 § 1, 1999).


3.50.080 Reference to ITE Handbook authorized in lieu of Appendix E for street facilities impact fee calculation. 

Where the proposed use is not specifically listed under Appendix E of the 2016 City of Buckley Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element, the planning director may determine the appropriate trip generation estimate by referring to the ITE Handbook, as now constituted or as hereafter amended or modified. The trip generation estimate shall be applied to the same cost per trip identified in the city of Buckley transportation element, as it now exists or is hereafter modified. (Ord. 01-18 § 3, 2018; Ord. 02-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 25-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 49-99 § 2, 1999).


3.50.085 Street impact fee discounts.

Chapter 3.64 SMALL AND ATTRACTIVE ITEMS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Sections:

3.64.010    Policy.

3.64.020    Purpose.

3.64.030    Procedures.


3.64.010 Policy.

It is the policy of the city to maintain accountability over all tangible items that may have the likelihood of disappearing without being noticed. The departments shall maintain records to be verified by a physical inventory at least once a year and provide such list to the city clerk for monitoring differences between years. (Ord. 04-17 § 1, 2017).


3.64.020 Purpose.

A small and attractive items system gathers information allowing investigation of items missing that would otherwise not be noticed. The system should provide adequate stewardship over its resources through control and accountability.

(1) General. Small and attractive items are defined as easily movable, desirable items with a unit cost of $500.00 to $4,999.99 and have a life expectancy of more than one year. This consists of items that are either concealable or portable and are also not likely to be missed immediately upon disappearance.

(2) Responsibility of Department Heads. Each department head or their designee will prepare a list at least annually of their small and attractive items. This list will be provided to the city clerk by January 31st each year for monitoring. If an item is deleted, the department head will note the reason and/or means of disposal.

(3) Asset Identification. The list will contain the serial number, model, or other identifying information. Whenever feasible, each piece of property will be engraved or marked with the city’s name. Such markings will be removed or obliterated only when the item is sold, scrapped, cannibalized, or otherwise disposed of.

(4) Small and Attractive Assets Defined. Small and attractive assets are not to include more permanent fixtures such as desks, tables and shelving, or items that are equipment for the purpose of accomplishing tasks that are very small in nature or of minimal monetary value, like minor equipment, shovels, wrenches, hand tools, staplers and the like. In addition, small and attractive assets never include items that are consumed or used up, such as asphalt, bottled water, printer paper, and the like. Small and attractive assets also do not include items that while they may meet the threshold when purchased are used as an accessory for a larger capital asset such vehicle accessories like light bars, cages, sirens, etc. Small and attractive assets should include communications equipment, optical devices (binoculars, telescopes, range finders, infrared viewers), cameras and photographic equipment, microcomputer systems, laptop and notebook computers, data-processing accessory equipment and components (scanners, data displays, etc.), stereos, radios, television sets, tape recorders, DVD players, VCRs, video cameras, weapons and shop equipment (power tools, scaffolding, ladders, etc.). (Ord. 04-17 § 1, 2017).


3.64.030 Procedures.

(1) Additions. The city may acquire small and attractive assets via purchase, construction, donation, or lease. Regardless of how it is acquired, when the small and attractive item is received, the purchasing department/fund will add it to their small and attractive database listing and mark the item with the city’s name (these items should be coded as object code 35 according to the BARS manual).

(2) Deletions. Items previously acquired will eventually depreciate in value and/or be disposed of and need to be deleted from the department’s list. Deletion may be required due to depreciation in value of an asset to below the tracking threshold, a sale of the asset, scrapping, mysterious disappearance (lost or stolen), or involuntary conversion (fire, flood, etc.). The department head controlling the item is the only one in position to trigger removal from their list. Items disappearing mysteriously may require additional reports to the police department, mayor, and insurance company. Deletions brought about as a result of natural disasters would require reporting to the insurance provider for an eventual reimbursement claim.

(3) Transfers. Occasional transfers of small and attractive items between departments, individuals within a department or funds will occur. The original controlling department/fund is accountable for all items and for initiating a notice of transfer. Interdepartmental transfers involving a proprietary fund (i.e., water/sewer) need to have a transfer of money. The sale price will be fair market value, which may result in a gain or a loss on sale of fixed assets. Interdepartmental transfers or intergovernmental (i.e., city to county or state) do not require the city to declare the item surplus or to do a public notice.

(4) Lost or Stolen Assets. Whenever a small and attractive item has mysteriously disappeared and all efforts have failed to recover it, the controlling department/fund shall notify the city clerk via memorandum, who will give a copy to the city administrator and mayor, file a police report and report to the insurance if necessary, and update the database accordingly. (Ord. 04-17 § 1, 2017).

It is the intention of council that the procedures set forth in this chapter are preferred over others; therefore, special procedures called for under other legislation are to be deemed exceptions to this chapter, and their use is to be limited accordingly. (Ord. 05-12 § 2, 2012).


3.66.020 Responsibility for administration.

The city administrator, or such other officer with equivalent duties as may from time to time be appointed, is responsible for the administration of this chapter. The city administrator shall coordinate the disposition of surplus property, and shall aid the council in determining the best method of disposal. All departments of the city shall cooperate with the city administrator to ensure the most efficient and beneficial disposition of surplus property. (Ord. 05-12 § 2, 2012). 


3.66.030 Determination of value.

If the department responsible for the property cannot make the estimate, the city administrator shall determine the reasonable market value. (Ord. 05-12 § 2, 2012).


3.66.040 Report to city administrator – Initial procedure.

A city department responsible for property which it wishes to declare surplus shall provide the city administrator with a detailed description of the property, its location and condition, and its estimated value. The city administrator shall then determine if any other department of the city has use for the property. If such a use is found, the city administrator shall carry out the transfer of ownership and shall ensure that, if necessary, the fund disposing of the property is reimbursed for its reasonable market value. (Ord. 05-12 § 2, 2012).


3.66.045 Property worth $2,000 or less.

(b) Solicitation of written bids;

(c) Negotiated sale to one or more designated buyers;

(4) The city administrator shall ensure that the proper fund is credited with any resulting proceeds. (Ord. 05-12 § 2, 2012).


3.66.060 Procedure – Property of a value of $20,000 or more.

Disposition of surplus property of a value of $20,000 or more must be approved by a majority of the city council. The procedure is as follows:

(1) The city council shall review the report of the city administrator at a public meeting, and may then give further directions to the city administrator. The city council has final authority to determine how the disposal will be carried out.

(2) The city administrator shall carry out the directions of the council with the assistance of the department owning the property.

(3) If the city council directs the surplus property’s disposal, the city administrator shall then dispose of the property in the manner specified by council and shall ensure that the proper fund is credited with any resulting proceeds. If the council does not approve disposing of the surplus property, the city council shall give the city administrator directions for further action.

(4) If the city administrator cannot dispose of the property in the manner specified by council, the city administrator shall report this fact to the council and make a recommendation for further action. (Ord. 05-12 § 2, 2012).

(1) Possible future requirements of the city;

(3) Likelihood of locating a buyer;

(1) Certain uses, because of their infrequent occurrence and temporary nature, are classified as “special events” or “community events.” These types of uses are temporary in nature, of limited duration, and may be associated with promotions, holidays, city festivals, etc. These special events shall be allowed by special events permit granted by the city administrator.

(2) Partnerships between the city, event sponsors, and the community are valuable in ensuring successful events. Therefore, the city will strive to accommodate special events.

(3) The city recognizes that events can be difficult to implement successfully and that the city requirements may represent a significant portion of the event’s costs. When setting fees and conditions for events, the city will be sensitive to their impacts on the event’s costs while balancing the city’s obligation to protect public health and safety and to be good stewards of the city’s resources. It is the city’s goal to have successful special events that enrich and enliven the community.

(4) It is the specific intent of this chapter and any procedures adopted hereunder to place the obligation of complying with the requirements of this chapter upon the applicant or sponsor, and no provision hereof is intended to impose any duty upon the city or any of its officers, employees, or agents. Nothing contained in this chapter or any procedures adopted is intended to be or shall be construed to create or form the basis for liability on the part of the city, or its officers, employees, or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of the applicant or sponsor to comply with the provisions hereof.

(2) Notice Regarding Dangerous Dog – Issuance. If, based on his investigation, the animal control officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the dog is dangerous, he shall cause to be sent to the person believed to have been in possession of the dog, or believed to have had the dog on premises within his control, a “notice regarding dangerous dog.” The notice shall be sent to the last known address of such person within 10 days after the animal control officer has completed his investigation.

(3) Confinement of Dog. If the animal control officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that a dog is dangerous and a risk to public safety, the animal control officer may effect entry into the yard of any private residence or business with the consent of the rightful occupant in order to seize any such dog, whether running at large or not, and confine said dog at an appropriate animal shelter pending the decision of the police chief following the hearing provided for in subsection (5) of this section. If the animal control officer is unable to gain consent by the rightful occupant, then the animal control officer may enter pursuant to warrant, to seize any such dog unless a public safety emergency justifies warrantless entry.

At the hearing, which may be continued from time to time, both oral and documentary evidence may be taken from any interested person and considered in determining whether the dog is dangerous. Any owner who fails to appear after notice as provided herein was given, without obtaining a continuance from the appeal officer, may be deemed to have waived any right to introduce evidence or object to an order made by the appeal officer. 

(6) Hearing – Findings – Public Nuisance. If, based upon the hearing, the appeal officer upholds the findings of the animal control officer that the dog is dangerous, he or she shall so specify in writing, together with the reasons therefor. Any dog found to be dangerous is deemed a public nuisance and shall be, pursuant to the order of the appeal officer, humanely destroyed, or removed from the city by appropriate order of the appeal officer. The decision of the appeal officer shall be made within 10 days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall be final. A copy of the decision shall be sent by certified mail or personally served upon the person in possession of or controlling the dog.

(7) Cost of Impoundment. If the appeal officer finds the dog is dangerous, costs of impoundment incurred by the city shall be paid by the owner or the person controlling the dog. If the appeal officer finds the dog is not dangerous, then the dog shall be released to the owner, and the cost of impound and kenneling shall be paid by the city.

10.84.300 Expulsion from parks.

(1) The recreation services director and his/her designees shall be empowered to exercise the authority of peace officers to the extent necessary to enforce this section.

(2) The recreation services director or his/her designees may, by delivering an exclusion notice in person to the offender, or by first class mail and certified mail to the offender at the offender’s last known address, exclude from a city park or city recreation facility anyone who within a city park or city recreation facility:

(a) Violates any provision of this chapter; or

(b) Violates any park or recreation facility rule; or

(c) Violates any provision of this code or the Revised Code of Washington.

The offender need not be charged, tried, or convicted of any crime or infraction in order for an exclusion notice to be issued or be effective. The exclusion may be based upon observation by the recreation services director or his/her designee or upon civilian reports that would ordinarily be relied upon by police officers in the determination of probable cause.

(3) If the offender:

(a) Has not been excluded from any city park or city recreation facility by an exclusion notice issued within one year prior to the violation and the current violation is not a weapon violation, then the recreation services director or his/her designee may exclude the offender from the city park or city recreation facility in which the current violation occurred for a period not exceeding seven days from the date of the exclusion notice.

(b) Has been the subject of only one prior exclusion notice issued within one year prior to the current violation and neither the current nor the past violation was a weapon violation, then the recreation services director or his/her designee may exclude the offender from any or all city parks and city recreation facilities for a period of 90 days from the date of the exclusion notice.

(c) Has been the subject of two or more prior exclusion notices issued within one year prior to the current violation, or if the current violation is a weapon violation, then the recreation services director or his/her designee may exclude the offender from any or all city parks and city recreation facilities for a period of one year from the date of the exclusion notice.

(4) The exclusion notice shall be in writing and shall contain the date of issuance. The exclusion notice shall specify the length and places of exclusion. It shall be signed by the issuing individual. Warning of the consequences for failure to comply shall be prominently displayed on the notice.

(5) Only the recreation services director or his/her designee after a review may rescind, shorten or modify an exclusion notice for a period not exceeding seven days.

(6) An offender receiving an exclusion notice longer than seven days may seek a hearing to have the exclusion notice rescinded, the period of exclusion shortened, or the areas of exclusion reduced. The hearing examiner shall be the city of Buckley police chief, unless the mayor designates another as the hearing examiner. The request for a hearing shall be delivered to the recreation services director or postmarked no later than seven days after the issuance date of the exclusion notice. The request for hearing shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a copy of the exclusion notice on which the hearing is sought. Such requests shall be forwarded by the recreation services director or his/her designee to the hearing examiner. The hearing should occur within seven days after the recreation services director receives the request for hearing. Hearings will be conducted by written request only.

(7) At the hearing, the violation must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence in order to uphold the exclusion notice. If the exclusion notice was issued because of the alleged violation of any criminal law, the offender need not be charged, tried, or convicted for the exclusion notice to be upheld. The exclusion notice establishes a prima facie case that the offender committed the violation as described. The hearing examiner shall consider a sworn report or a declaration made under penalty of perjury, written by the individual who issued the exclusion notice, without further evidentiary foundation. The certifications authorized in Rule 6.13 of the Criminal Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction shall be considered without further evidentiary foundation. The hearing examiner may consider information that would not be admissible under the evidence rules in a court of law but which the hearing examiner considers relevant and trustworthy.

(8) If the violation is proved, the exclusion notice shall be upheld; but upon good cause shown, the hearing examiner may shorten the duration of the exclusion or reduce the areas covered by the exclusion. If the violation is not proved by a preponderance of the evidence, the hearing examiner shall rescind the exclusion. If the hearing examiner rescinds an exclusion, the exclusion shall not be considered a prior exclusion for purposes of subsection (3) of this section.

(9) The decision of the hearing examiner is final. An offender seeking judicial review of hearing examiner’s decision must file an application for a writ of review in the Pierce County superior court within 15 days of the date of that decision.

(10) The exclusion shall remain in effect during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding.

(11) No determination of facts made by a person conducting a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding and shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding.

(12) This section shall be enforced so as to emphasize voluntary compliance with laws and park and recreation facility rules, and so that inadvertent minor violations that would fall under subsection (3)(a) of this section can be corrected without resort to an exclusion notice. (Ord. 04-11 § 1, 2011).

A registered owner who has complied with RCW 46.52.104 shall be relieved of liability under this section.

11.44.160 Sale by tow truck operator.

If, after the expiration of 15 days from the date of mailing of notice to the registered and legal owner, the vehicle or automobile hulk remains unclaimed and has not been listed as a stolen or recovered vehicle, then the tow truck operator having custody of such vehicle or hulk shall conduct a sale of the same at public auction after having first published a notice of the date, place and time of such auction in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the vehicle is located not less than three days before the date of such auction to the highest bidder. The charges due the tow truck operator, including the costs of sale, which shall be computed as in a public auction of personal property by the sheriff, shall be certified one-half to the county treasurer to be credited to the county current expense fund, and one-half to the State Treasurer to be credited to the highway safety fund. If the amount bid at the auction is insufficient to compensate the tow truck operator for his towing and storage charges and the costs of sale, such tow truck operator shall be entitled to assert a claim for any deficiency, not to exceed $100.00. A registered owner who has complied with RCW 46.52.104 shall be relieved of liability under this section. (Ord. 1011, 1981; Ord. 790 § 15, 1970).


11.44.170 Lien by tow truck operator.

A tow truck operator bonded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter who tows, transports or stores any vehicle, whether by contract or at the direction of any public officer, shall have a lien upon such vehicle so long as the same remains in his possession for the charges for such towing, transportation or storage. If such a vehicle remains unclaimed for five days, it may be deemed abandoned and subject to the provisions of BMC 11.44.120 and 11.44.130. (Ord. 1011, 1981; Ord. 790 § 16, 1970).


11.44.180 Abatement of nuisance on private property.

A public nuisance that exists on private property shall be abated as follows:

(1) Costs of abatement and removal of such vehicle may be assessed against the last registered owner of the vehicle or automobile hulk if the identity of such owner can be determined unless such owner in the transfer of such vehicle or automobile hulk has complied with RCW 46.12.101, or the costs may be assessed against the owner of the real property on which the vehicle is stored and shall constitute a lien thereon.

(2) Before the abatement or removal of such vehicle or automobile hulk, notice shall be given to the last registered owner thereof of record and the real property owner of record that a public hearing may be requested before the council, and if no hearing is requested within 10 days, the vehicle or automobile hulk will be removed and abated and the costs thereof assessed in accordance with this chapter.

(3) If a request for hearing is received by the city clerk, a notice giving the time, location and date of such hearing on the question of the abatement and removal of such vehicle or automobile hulk as a public nuisance shall be mailed by certified or registered mail, with a five-day return requested, to the owner of the real property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owner of record of such motor vehicle or hulk, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.

(4) The applicant for hearing may appear in person at such hearing, or present a written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land with his reasons for such denial. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle or automobile hulk was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner, and that he has to subsequently acquiesce in its presence, then the city council shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle or automobile hulk against property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from said landowner.

(5) After notice has been given of the intent of the city to dispose of a vehicle or automobile hulk, the vehicle or automobile hulk or part thereof shall be removed from the private property by the chief of police and disposed of to a licensed auto wrecker or tow truck operator, with notice to the State Patrol and the Department of Motor Vehicles that such vehicle or automobile hulk has been wrecked. The city may operate a disposal site if the city clerk determines that commercial channels are not available or are inadequate, and may make final disposition of the vehicle hulk or parts, or may transfer such vehicle hulk or parts to another governmental body, provided its disposal shall be only as scrap.

(6) Within 30 days after the removal by the chief of police of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative automotive vehicle from real property, the city may file for recording with the county auditor a claim for lien for the costs of removal, which shall be in substance in accordance with provisions covering mechanic’s lien in Chapter 60.04 RCW, and said lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as such mechanic’s lien. (Ord. 06-15 § 20, 2015; Ord. 1011, 1981; Ord. 790 § 17, 1970).1

The city shall not prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

12.08.010 Purpose.

(1) The purpose of this title is to designate and classify ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas and to protect these areas and their functions and values, while also allowing for reasonable use of private property.

(2) This title is to implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the city of Buckley comprehensive plan and the Growth Management Act.

(3) The city of Buckley finds that critical areas provide a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city of Buckley and its residents, and/or may pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property. The beneficial functions and values provided by critical areas include, but are not limited to, water quality protection and enhancement, fish and wildlife habitat, food chain support, flood storage, conveyance and attenuation, ground water recharge and discharge, erosion control, wave attenuation, protection from hazards, historical and archaeological and aesthetic value protection, and recreation. These beneficial functions are not listed in order of priority.

(4) Goals. By limiting development and alteration of critical areas, this title seeks to:

(a) Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures, erosion, seismic events, volcanic eruptions, or flooding;

(b) Protect unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, and fish and wildlife and their habitats;

(c) Direct activities not dependent on critical area resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas;

(d) Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat, frequently flooded areas and habitat conservation areas; and

(e) Implement the primary goal of achieving no net loss of functions and values of wetlands.

(5) The regulations of this title are intended to protect critical areas in accordance with the Growth Management Act and through the application of best available science, as determined according to WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925, and in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals.

(6) This title is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this title to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of the property.

(7) The city of Buckley’s enactment or enforcement of this title shall not be construed for the benefit of any individual person or group of persons other than the general public (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.08.020 Authority.

(1) As provided herein, the city planning director is given the authority to interpret and apply, and the responsibility to enforce, this title to accomplish the stated purpose.

(2) The city of Buckley may withhold, condition, or deny development permits or activity approvals to ensure that the proposed action is consistent with this title. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.08.030 Relationship to other regulations.

(1) These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay and in addition to zoning and other regulations adopted by the city of Buckley.

(2) These critical area regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), as locally adopted.

(3) Compliance with the provisions of this title does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, shoreline substantial development permits, HPA permits, Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits, and NPDES permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this title. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.08.035 Definitions.

For purposes of this chapter and subsequent chapters related to critical areas regulation, Chapters 12.09, 12.10, 12.11, 12.12 and 12.13 BMC, the following definitions shall apply except that those not defined in this title shall be as defined in the City of Buckley Municipal Code, the Washington Administrative Code, or the Revised Code of Washington. Words not found in any of these codes shall be as defined in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, latest edition.

“Active fault” means a fault that is considered likely to undergo renewed movement within a period of concern to humans. Faults are commonly considered to be active if the fault has moved one or more times in the last 10,000 years, but faults may also be considered active in some cases if movement has occurred in the last 500,000 years.

“Adaptive management” means a systematic process for improving management policies and practices by learning from the outcomes of previous policies and practices. Related to compensatory mitigation, it involves the permittee and the agencies discussing the problems occurring on a compensation site and coming to agreement on possible solutions or alternative approaches necessary to bring the site into compliance.

“Adjacent” means immediately adjoining (in contact with the boundary of the influence area) or within a distance that is less than that needed to separate activities from critical areas to ensure protection of the functions and values of the critical areas. “Adjacent” shall mean any activity or development located:

(a) On a site immediately adjoining a critical area;

(b) A distance equal to or less than the required critical area buffer width and building setback;

(c) A distance equal to or less than one-half mile (2,640 feet) from a bald eagle nest;

(d) A distance equal to or less than 300 feet upland from a stream, wetland, or water body;

(e) Bordering or within the floodway, floodplain, or channel migration zone;

(f) A distance equal to or less than 200 feet from a critical aquifer recharge area.

“Advance mitigation” means mitigation of an anticipated critical area impact or hazard completed according to an approved critical areas report and prior to site development.

“Agricultural land” means land primarily devoted to the commercial production of horticultural, viticultural, floricultural, dairy, apiary, or animal products or of berries, grain, hay, straw, turf, seed, Christmas trees not subject to the excise tax imposed by RCW 84.33.100 through 84.33.140, or livestock, and/or that has been designated as of long-term commercial significance for agricultural production.

“Alteration” means any human-induced change in an existing condition of a critical area or its buffer. Alterations include, but are not limited to, grading, filling, channelizing, dredging, clearing (vegetation), construction, compaction, excavation or any other activity that changes the character of the critical area.

“Anadromous fish” means fish that spawn and rear in freshwater and mature in the marine environment. While Pacific salmon die after their first spawning, adult char (bull trout) can live for many years, moving in and out of saltwater and spawning each year. The life history of Pacific salmon and char contains critical periods of time when these fish are more susceptible to environmental and physical damage than at other times. The life history of salmon, for example, contains the following stages: upstream migration of adults, spawning, intergravel incubation, rearing, smoltification (the time period needed for juveniles to adjust their body functions to live in the marine environment), downstream migration, and ocean rearing to adults.

“Applicant” means a person who files an application for a permit under this title and who is either the owner of the land on which that proposed activity would be located, a contract purchaser, or the authorized agent of such a person.

“Aquifer” means a geological formation, group of formations or part of a formation that is capable of yielding a significant amount of water to a well or spring.

“Aquifer, confined” means an aquifer bounded above and below by beds of distinctly lower permeability than that of the aquifer itself and that contains ground water under sufficient pressure for the water to rise above the top of the aquifer.

“Aquifer recharge areas” means areas that, due to the presence of certain soils, geology, and surface water, act to recharge ground water by percolation.

“Aquifer, sole source” means an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, Section 1424(e). The aquifer(s) must supply 50 percent or more of the drinking water for an area without a sufficient replacement available.

“Aquifer susceptibility” means the ease with which contaminants can move from the land surface to the aquifer based solely on the types of surface and subsurface materials in the area. Susceptibility usually defines the rate at which a contaminant will reach an aquifer unimpeded by chemical interactions with the vadose zone media.

“Aquifer, unconfined” means an aquifer not bounded above by a bed of distinctly lower permeability than that of the aquifer itself and containing ground water under pressure approximately equal to that of the atmosphere. This term is synonymous with the term “water table aquifer.”

“Area of shallow flooding” means an area designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance map(s). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

“Associated wetlands” means those wetlands which are in proximity to and either influence or are influenced by tidal waters or a lake or stream subject to the Shoreline Management Act.

“Avalanche hazard” means an area susceptible to a large mass of snow or ice, sometimes accompanied by other material, moving rapidly down a mountain slope.

“Base flood” means a flood event having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, also referred to as the 100-year flood. Designations of base flood areas on flood insurance map(s) always include the letters A or V.

“Best available science” means current scientific information used in the process to designate, protect, or restore critical areas, that is derived from a valid scientific process as defined by WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925. Some recognized sources of best available science are included in “Citations of Recommended Sources of Best Available Science for Designating and Protecting Critical Areas” published by the State Office of Community Development.

“Best management practices (BMPs)” means conservation practices or systems of practices and management measures that:

(a) Control soil loss and reduce water quality degradation caused by high concentrations of nutrients, animal waste, toxins, and sediment;

(b) Minimize adverse impacts to surface water and ground water flow, circulation patterns, and to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of wetlands;

(c) Protect trees and vegetation designated to be retained during and following site construction; and

(d) Provide standards for proper use of chemical herbicides within critical areas.

The city of Buckley shall monitor the application of best management practices to ensure that the standards and policies of this title are adhered to.

“Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

“Buffer” or “buffer zone” means an area contiguous to and that protects a critical area that is required for the continued maintenance, functioning, and/or structural stability of a critical area.

“Channel migration zone (CMZ)” means the lateral extent of likely movement along a stream or river during the next 100 years as determined by evidence of active stream channel movement over the past 100 years. Evidence of active movement over the 100-year time frame can be inferred from aerial photos or from specific channel and valley-bottom characteristics. The time span typically represents the time it takes to grow mature trees that can provide functional large woody debris to streams. A CMZ is not typically present if the valley width is generally less than two bankfull widths, is confined by terraces, no current or historical aerial photographic evidence exists of significant channel movement, and there is no field evidence of secondary channels with recent scour from stream flow or progressive bank erosion at meander bends. Areas separated from the active channel by legally existing artificial channel constraints that limit bank erosion and channel avulsion without hydraulic connections shall not be considered within the CMZ.

“Compensation project” means actions necessary to replace project-induced critical area and buffer losses, including land acquisition, planning, construction plans, monitoring and contingency actions.

“Compensatory mitigation” means replacing project-induced wetland losses or impacts, and includes, but is not limited to, the following:

(a) “Restoration” means actions performed to reestablish wetland functional characteristics and processes that have been lost by alterations, activities, or catastrophic events within an area that no longer meets the definition of a wetland.

(b) “Creation” means actions performed to intentionally establish a wetland at a site where it did not formerly exist.

(c) “Enhancement” means actions performed to improve the condition of existing degraded wetlands so that the functions they provide are of a higher quality.

(d) “Preservation” means actions taken to ensure the permanent protection of existing, high-quality wetlands.

“Conservation easement” means a legal agreement that the property owner enters into to restrict uses of the land. Such restrictions can include, but are not limited to, passive recreation uses such as trails or scientific uses and fences or other barriers to protect habitat. The easement is recorded on a property deed, runs with the land, and is legally binding on all present and future owners of the property, therefore providing permanent or long-term protection.

“Critical aquifer recharge area” means an area designated by WAC 365-190-080(2) that is determined to have a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2).

Development includes the storage or use of equipment or materials inconsistent with the existing use. Development also includes approvals issued by the city of Buckley that bind land to specific patterns of use, including but not limited to subdivisions, short subdivisions, zone changes, conditional use permits, and binding site plans. (Also see Chapter 12.11 BMC, Frequently Flooded Areas.) Development activity does not include activities such as:

(a) Interior building improvements.

(b) Exterior structure maintenance activities, including painting and roofing.

(c) Routine landscape maintenance of established ornamental landscaping, such as lawn mowing, pruning and weeding.

(d) Maintenance of the following existing facilities that does not expand the affected area: septic tanks (routine cleaning); wells; individual utility service connections; and individual cemetery plots in established and approved cemeteries.

12.08.100 Protection of critical areas.

Any action taken pursuant to this title shall result in equivalent or greater functions and values of the critical areas associated with the proposed action, as determined by the best available science. All actions and developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with BMC 12.08.240, Mitigation sequencing, and/or BMC 12.08.260, Innovative mitigation, to minimize and mitigate all adverse impacts. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.08.110 Best available science.

(1) Protection for Functions and Values and Anadromous Fish. Critical areas reports and decisions to alter critical areas shall include the best available science in order to protect the functions and values of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish and their habitat, such as salmon and bull trout.

(2) Best Available Science to Be Used Must Be Consistent with Criteria. The best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local, state or federal natural resource agencies, or a qualified scientific expert or team of qualified scientific experts that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925.

Whether a person is a qualified scientific expert with expertise appropriate to the relevant critical areas is determined by the person’s professional credentials and/or certification, any advanced degrees earned in the pertinent scientific discipline from a recognized university, the number of years of experience in the pertinent scientific discipline, recognized leadership in the discipline of interest, formal training in the specific area of expertise, and field and/or laboratory experience with evidence of the ability to produce peer-reviewed publications or other professional literature. No one factor is determinative in deciding whether a person is a qualified scientific expert. Where pertinent scientific information implicates multiple scientific disciplines, cities are encouraged to consult a team of qualified scientific experts representing the various disciplines to ensure the identification and inclusion of the best available science.

(3) Characteristics of a Valid Scientific Process. In the context of critical areas protection, a valid scientific process is one that produces reliable information useful in understanding the consequences of a local government’s regulatory decisions, and in developing critical areas policies and development regulations that will be effective in protecting the functions and values of critical areas. To determine whether information received during the permit review process is reliable scientific information, the city planning director shall determine whether the source of the information displays the characteristics of a valid scientific process. Such characteristics are as follows:

(a) Peer Review. The information has been critically reviewed by other persons who are qualified scientific experts in that scientific discipline. The proponents of the information have addressed the criticism of the peer reviewers. Publication in a refereed scientific journal usually indicates that the information has been appropriately peer-reviewed;

(b) Methods. The methods used to obtain the information are clearly stated and replicated. The methods are standardized in the pertinent scientific discipline or, if not, the methods have been appropriately peer-reviewed to assure their reliability and validity;

(c) Logical Conclusions and Reasonable Inferences. The conclusions presented are based on reasonable assumptions supported by other studies and consistent with the general theory underlying the assumptions. The conclusions are logically and reasonably derived from the assumptions and supported by the data presented. Any gaps in information and inconsistencies with other pertinent scientific information are adequately explained;

(d) Quantitative Analysis. The data have been analyzed using appropriate statistical or quantitative methods;

(e) Context. The information is placed in proper context. The assumptions, analytical techniques, data, and conclusions are appropriately framed with respect to the prevailing body of pertinent scientific knowledge; and

(f) References. The assumptions, analytical techniques, and conclusions are well referenced with citations to relevant, credible literature and other pertinent existing information.

(4) Nonscientific Information. Nonscientific information may supplement scientific information, but it is not an adequate substitute for valid and available scientific information. Common sources of nonscientific information include the following:

12.09.010 Designation, rating and mapping wetlands.

(1) Designating Wetlands. Wetlands are those areas, designated in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements.

(2) Wetland Ratings. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Department of Ecology wetland rating system found in the Washington State Wetland Rating System documents (Western Washington, Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029) or as revised by Ecology. These documents contain the definitions and methods for determining if the criteria below are met.

(a) Wetland Rating Categories.

(i) Category I. Category I wetlands are those that (A) represent a unique or rare wetland type; or (B) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or (C) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (D) provide a high level of functions. The following types of wetlands are Category I:

(A) Wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more);

(B) Wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program (WNHP) or Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR);

(C) Bogs;

(D) Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

(E) Wetlands in coastal lagoons;

(F) Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre; or

(G) Interdunal wetlands that score 8 or 9 habitat points and are larger than one acre.

(ii) Category II. Category II wetlands are those not defined as Category I wetlands and include:

(A) Interdunal wetlands larger than one acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands;

(B) Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

(C) Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points).

(iii) Category III. Category III wetlands are (A) wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scores between 16 and 19 points); (B) can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project; and (C) interdunal wetlands between 0.1 and one acre in size. Wetlands scoring between 16-19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways, and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.

(iv) Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scoring fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that we should be able to replace, or in some cases to improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree.

(3) Mapping of Wetlands. The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown on the adopted critical area maps as referenced in BMC 12.08.090(4) and (5).

(4) The identification, classification, extent and location of any wetland shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a qualified consultant using the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.09.020 Critical areas report – Additional requirements for wetlands.

In addition to the general critical areas report requirements of BMC 12.08.210, critical areas reports for wetlands must meet the requirements of this section. Critical areas reports for two or more types of critical areas must meet the report requirements for each relevant type of critical area.

(1) Wetland Analysis. In addition to the minimum required contents of BMC 12.08.210, Critical areas reports – Requirements, a critical areas report for wetlands shall contain an analysis of the wetlands including the following site- and proposal-related information at a minimum:

(a) A written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers within 300 feet of the project area, including the following information at a minimum:

(i) The project area of the proposed activity;

(ii) Wetland delineation and required buffers;

(iii) Existing wetland acreage;

(iv) Wetland category; vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics;

(v) Soil and substrate conditions; and

(vi) Topographic elevations, at five-foot contours.

(b) Proposed mitigation, if needed, including a written assessment and accompanying maps of the mitigation area, including the information detailed in BMC 12.08.250, Mitigation plan requirements.

(2) Additional Information May Be Required. When appropriate, the planning director may also require the critical areas report to include an evaluation by the Department of Ecology or an independent qualified expert regarding the applicant’s analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, and to include any recommendations as appropriate. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.09.030 Performance standards – General requirements.

(1) Activities may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas.

(2) Activities and uses shall be prohibited from wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this title.

(3) Category I Wetlands. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from Category I, except as provided for in the public agency and utility exception, reasonable use exception, and variance sections of this title.

(4) Category II. With respect to activities proposed in Category II wetlands, the following standards shall apply:

(a) Water-dependent activities as provided for under the city’s shoreline master program may be allowed where there are no feasible alternatives that would not have a less adverse impact on the wetland, its buffers and other critical areas.

(b) Where non-water-dependent activities are proposed, it shall be presumed that alternative locations are available, and activities and uses shall be prohibited, unless the applicant demonstrates that:

(i) The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished and successfully avoid, or result in less adverse impact on, a wetland on another site or sites in the general region; and

(ii) All alternative designs of the project as proposed, that would avoid, or result in less of an adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project, are not feasible.

(5) Category III and IV Wetlands. Activities and uses that result in unavoidable and necessary impacts may be permitted in Category III and IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical areas report and mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives.

(6) Wetland Buffers.

(a) Land Use Intensity. Wetland buffers in the city of Buckley are determined based on the category of the wetland and the land use intensity proposed. Land use impact “intensity” is based on development types and the estimated impact based on the proposed change in land use.

Land Use Impact “Intensity” Based on Development Types  

	Rating of impact from proposed changes in land use	Types of land uses that cause the impact based on common zoning categories

	High 	Commercial, urban, industrial, institutional, retail sales, residential with more than two units/acre, new agriculture (high-intensity processing such as dairies, nurseries and green houses, raising and harvesting crops requiring annual tilling, raising and maintaining animals), high intensity recreation (golf courses, ball fields), hobby farms

	Moderate	Residential with two units/acre or less, moderate-intensity open space (parks), new agriculture (moderate-intensity such as orchards and hay fields)

	Low	Forestry, open space (low-intensity such as passive recreation and natural resources preservation)

(b) Buffer Widths. The city of Buckley establishes the following buffer widths based on category and land use intensity, as defined above. These buffer widths presume the existence of a relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. Required wetland buffers, based on wetland category and land use intensity, are as follows:

Alternative 2 Buffer Widths, Based Upon Category and Land Use Intensity  

	Category (2014 Wrn. WA Rating System)	Total Points in Rating System	Alternative 2 Buffer Category + Land Use Intensity (lo/mod/hi)

(c) Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category and the proposed land use. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

(d) Modification of Buffer Widths. The buffer widths of subsection (6)(b) of this section may be decreased through buffer width averaging in subsection (6)(e) of this section or reduction mechanisms of this section.

(i) The buffer widths recommended for land uses with “high intensity” impacts to wetlands can be reduced to those recommended for “moderate intensity” impacts under the conditions identified below.

(A) For wetlands that score moderate or high for habitat (6 points or more), the width of the buffer around the wetland can be reduced if the following measures to minimize the impacts of different land uses on wetlands are applied.

	Disturbance	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	•    Direct lights away from wetland 

	Noise	•    Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

•    If warranted, enhance existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source

•    For activities that generate relatively continuous, potentially disruptive noise, such as certain heavy industry or mining, establish an additional 10 ft heavily vegetated buffer strip immediately adjacent to the outer wetland buffer

	Toxic runoff	•    Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

•    Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 ft of wetland

•    Apply integrated pest management

	Stormwater runoff	•    Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

•    Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer 

•    Use low-intensity development techniques (for more information refer to Chapter 14.30 BMC and the Stormwater Management Manual)

	Change in water regime	•    Infiltrate or treat, detain and disperse into buffer new runoff from surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance	•    Use privacy fencing or plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion

•    Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement

	Dust	•    Use best management practices to control dust

(e) Wetland Buffer Width Averaging. The planning director may also allow modification of the wetland buffer width in accordance with an approved critical areas report and the best available science on a case-by-case basis by averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified wetlands consultant demonstrates that:

(i) It will not reduce wetland functions or values;

(ii) The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;

(iii) The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer;

(iv) The buffer width is not reduced to less than 50 percent of the high intensity buffer width or 50 feet, whichever is greater, except for buffers for Category III and IV wetlands and low or moderate intensity land uses; and

(v) Buffer width averaging is being conducted and/or implemented within or on the property where the averaging is being requested.

(f) Buffer Uses. In addition to those allowed uses listed within BMC 12.08.160, the following uses may be permitted within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this title, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

(i) Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife;

(ii) Passive Recreation. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical areas report, including:

(A) Walkways and trails, pursuant to BMC 12.08.160(3)(c)(i) and (ii); and

(B) Wildlife viewing structures; and

(C) Fishing access areas.

(iii) Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities, limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls, detention facilities and bioswales, may be allowed; provided, that:

(A) Alternate locations have been considered and been demonstrated to not be feasible; and

(B) The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland.

(C) Stormwater detention facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands.

(7) Signs and Fencing of Wetlands.

(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and inspected by the planning director prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the planning director shall require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

Permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 100 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:

Protected Wetland Area

Do Not Disturb

Contact the City of Buckley Regarding Uses and Restriction

(c) Fencing.

(i) The planning director may require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland.

(ii) The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on-site.

(iii) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection (7)(c) shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.09.040 Performance standards – Mitigation requirements.

(1) Mitigation shall achieve equivalent or greater biological functions. Mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions.

(2) Mitigation shall result in no net loss. Wetland mitigation actions shall not result in a net loss of wetland area or functions and values except when the following criteria are met:

(a) The lost wetland area provides minimal functions and the mitigation action(s) results in a net gain in wetland functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment; or

(b) The lost wetland area provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment and other replacement habitats provide greater benefits to the functioning of the watershed, such as riparian habitat restoration and enhancement; or

(c) Out-of-kind replacement will best meet formally identified regional goals, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

(3) Preference of Mitigation Actions. Mitigation actions that require compensation by replacing, enhancing, or substitution shall occur in the following order of preference:

(a) Enhancing on-site degraded wetlands.

(i) Restoring wetlands on upland sites that were formerly wetlands and/or have been degraded.

(5) Wetlands Enhancement as Mitigation.

(a) Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by enhancement of existing significantly degraded wetlands. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands must produce a critical areas report that identifies how enhancement will increase the functions of the degraded wetland and how this increase will adequately mitigate for the loss of wetland area and function at the impact site. An enhancement proposal must also show whether existing wetland functions will be reduced by the enhancement actions. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).

12.11.005 Definitions.

In addition to the definitions in Chapter 12.08 BMC, the following definitions will be used for this chapter. If any term is defined differently in the municipal code, the following terms shall take precedence for floodplains and floodways:

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

“Elevation certificate” means the official form (FEMA Form 086-0-33) used to track development and provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance premium rate with Section B completed by community officials.

“Increased cost of compliance” means a flood insurance claim payment up to $30,000 directly to a property owner for the cost to comply with floodplain management regulations after a direct physical loss caused by a flood. Eligibility for an ICC claim can be through a single instance of “substantial damage” or as a result of a “cumulative substantial damage.” (More information can be found in FEMA ICC Manual 301.)

“Mobile home park or subdivision” means one of the following:

(a) “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

(b) “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

(c) “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

“New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(a) Before the improvement or repair is started; or

(b) If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

(i) This term “substantial improvement” can exclude:

(A) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct pre-cited existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been previously identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or

(B) Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

“Violation” for this chapter (floods) means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017).


12.11.010 Designation of frequently flooded areas.

(1) Frequently Flooded Areas. Frequently flooded areas shall include:

(a) The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Pierce County and Incorporated Areas” dated March 7, 2017, and any revisions thereto, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study and the FIRM are on file at the building and planning office. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in this chapter shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under this chapter.

(b) Areas Identified by the Director. Those areas of special flood hazard identified by the planning director based on review of base flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, state, Pierce County or other valid sources when base flood elevation data has not been provided from the Federal Insurance Administration (A and V zones of the flood insurance map(s)).

(2) Use of Additional Information. The planning director may use additional flood information that is more restrictive or detailed than that provided in the flood insurance study conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to designate frequently flooded areas, including data on channel migration, historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, location of restrictive floodways, maps showing future build-out conditions, maps that show riparian habitat areas, or similar information.

(3) Flood Elevation Data. When base flood elevation data is not available (A and V zones), the planning director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source in order to administer this chapter.

(4) Designation Made by Director. The flood insurance maps are to be used as a guide for the city of Buckley, project applicants and/or property owners, and the public, and should be considered a minimum designation of frequently flooded areas.

Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as geologically hazardous areas:

(1) Erosion hazard;

(2) Landslide hazard;

(3) Seismic hazard;

(4) Mine hazard;

(5) Volcanic hazard; and

(6) Other geological events including tsunamis, mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement. (Ord. 10-17 § 1 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 21-05 § 2, 2005).


12.12.020 Designation of specific hazard areas.

(1) Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are at least those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “moderate to severe,” “severe,” or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard.

(2) Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Examples of these may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) Areas of historic failures, such as:

(i) Those areas delineated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development;

(ii) Those areas mapped by the Department of Ecology (Coastal Zone Atlas) or the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (“U” or class 3), unstable old slides (“UOS” or class 4), or unstable recent slides (“URS” or class 5); or

(iii) Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources;

(b) Areas with all three of the following characteristics:

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any affected employer at any single worksite within the corporate limits of the city. (Ord. 18-99 § 6, 1999).


12.16.050 Notification of applicability.

In addition to Buckley’s established public notification for adoption of an ordinance, a notice of availability of a summary of this chapter, a notice of the requirements and criteria for affected employers to comply with this chapter, and subsequent revisions shall be published at least once in Buckley’s official newspaper not more than 30 days after passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter or revisions. Affected employers located in Buckley are to receive written notification that they are subject to this chapter. Such notice shall be addressed to the company’s chief executive officer, senior official, or CTR manager at the worksite. Such notification shall be at least 180 days prior to the due date for submittal of their CTR program. Affected employers that, for whatever reason, do not receive notice within 30 days of passage of said ordinance and are either notified or identify themselves to the city within 180 days of the passage of said ordinance will be granted an extension to assure up to 180 days within which to develop and submit a CTR program. Affected employers that have not been identified or do not identify themselves within 180 days of the passage of said ordinance and do not submit a CTR program within 180 days from the passage of said ordinance are in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 18-99 § 7, 1999).


12.16.060 New affected employers.

Employers that meet the definition of “affected employer” in this chapter must identify themselves to the city within 180 days of either moving into the boundaries of city or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees.

(Ord. 18-99 § 8, 1999).


12.16.070 Change in status as an affected employer.

Any of the following changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements:

(1) If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the city that it is no longer an affected employer.

(2) If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.

(3) If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an “unaffected” employer, that employer shall be treated as a new affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other new affected employers. (Ord. 18-99 § 9, 1999).


12.16.080 Requirements for employers.

An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and SOV commute trips. The employer shall submit a description of its program to Buckley and provide an annual progress report to Buckley on employee commuting and progress toward meeting the SOV goals. The CTR program must include the mandatory elements as described below. (Ord. 18-99 § 10, 1999).


12.16.090 CTR program description requirements.

The CTR program description presents the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for each goal year. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other and to form or use transportation management organizations in developing and implementing CTR programs.

At a minimum, the employer’s description must include:

(1) General description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, and surrounding services, including unique conditions experienced by the employer or its employees; 

(2) Number of employees affected by the CTR program; 

(3) Documentation of compliance with the mandatory CTR program elements (as described in BMC 12.16.100); 

(4) Description of the additional elements included in the CTR program (as described in BMC 12.16.100); and

12.16.100 Mandatory program elements.

Each employer’s CTR program shall include the following mandatory elements:

(1) Transportation Coordinator. The employer shall designate a transportation coordinator to administer the CTR program. The coordinator’s and/or designee’s name, location, and telephone number must be displayed prominently at each affected worksite. The coordinator shall oversee all elements of the employer’s CTR program and act as liaison between the employer and city. The objective is to have an effective transportation coordinator presence at each worksite; an affected employer with multiple sites may have one transportation coordinator for all sites.

(2) Information Distribution. Information about alternatives to SOV commuting shall be provided to employees at least once a year. Each employer’s program description and annual report must report the information to be distributed and the method of distribution.

(3) Annual Progress Report. The CTR program must include an annual review of employee commuting and progress and good faith efforts toward meeting the SOV reduction goals. Affected employers shall file an annual progress report with the city in accordance with the format established by this chapter and consistent with the CTR task force guidelines. The report shall describe each of the CTR measures that were in effect for the previous year, the results of any commuter surveys undertaken during the year, and the number of employees participating in CTR programs. Within the report, the employer should evaluate the effectiveness of the CTR program and, if necessary, propose modifications to achieve the CTR goals. Survey information or approved alternative information must be provided in the reports submitted in the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth years after implementation begins. The employer should contact the city for the format of the report.

(4) Additional Program Elements. In addition to the specific program elements described above, the employer’s CTR program shall include additional elements as needed to meet CTR goals. Elements may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

(a) Provision of preferential parking or reduced parking charges, or both, for high-occupancy vehicles; instituting or increasing parking charges for SOVs; provision of commuter ride matching services to facilitate employee ride-sharing for commute trips;

(h) Construction of special loading and unloading facilities for transit, carpool, and vanpool users;

(i) Provision of bicycle parking facilities, lockers, changing areas, and showers for employees who bicycle or walk to work;

(j) Provision of a program of parking incentives such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities;

(k) Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes; 

(l) Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed work week which reduces commuting; and

(m) Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities and emergency taxi services. (Ord. 18-99 § 12, 1999).


12.16.110 Record keeping.

Affected employers shall include a list of the records they will keep as part of the CTR program they submit to Buckley for approval. Employers will maintain all records listed in their CTR program for a minimum of 24 months. Buckley and the employer shall agree on the record keeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program. (Ord. 18-99 § 13, 1999).


12.16.120 Schedule and process for CTR reports.

(1) CTR Program. Not more than 180 days after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within six months after an employer qualifies under the provisions of this chapter, the employer shall develop a CTR program and shall submit to the city a description of that program for review.

(2) Document Review. Buckley shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or annual report within 90 days of submission, the employer’s program or annual report is deemed accepted. The city may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

(3) CTR Annual Progress Reports. Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, the city shall establish the employer’s annual reporting date, which shall not be less than 12 months from the day the program is submitted. Each year on the employer’s reporting date, the employer shall submit to the city its annual CTR report.

(4) Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to Buckley for modification of CTR program elements, other than the mandatory elements specified in this chapter, including record keeping requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exist:

(a) The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or

(b) The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship. This may include evidence from employee surveys administered at the worksite: first, in the base year, showing that the employer’s own base year values of VMT per employee and SOV rates were higher than the CTR zone average; and/or secondly, in the goal measurement year(s), showing that the employer has achieved reductions from its own base values that are comparable to the reduction goals established for the employer’s CTR zone.

(5) Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program or CTR annual progress report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The city shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s annual reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s annual reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the city administrator. (Ord. 18-99 § 14, 1999).


12.16.130 Implementation of employer’s CTR program.

Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program not more than 180 days after the program was first submitted to the city. Implementation of the approved program modifications shall begin within 30 days of the final decision or 180 days from submission of the CTR program or CTR annual report, whichever is greater. (Ord. 18-99 § 15, 1999).


12.16.140 Credit for transportation demand management efforts leadership certificate.

As public recognition for their efforts, employers with VMT per employee and proportion of SOV trips lower than the zone average will receive a commute trip reduction certificate of leadership from the city. (Ord. 18-99 § 16, 1999).


12.16.150 Credit for programs implemented prior to the base year.

Employers with successful TDM programs implemented prior to the base year may be eligible to apply for program exemption credit, which exempts them from most program requirements. Affected employers wishing to receive credit for the results of existing TDM efforts may do so by applying to city within 90 days of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Application shall include data from a survey of employees or equivalent to establish the applicant’s VMT per employee and proportion of SOV trips. The survey or equivalent data shall conform to all applicable standards established in the CTR task force guidelines. The employer shall be considered to have met the first measurement goals if their VMT per employee and proportion of SOV trips are equivalent to a 12 percent or greater reduction from the final base year CTR zone values. This three percentage point credit applies only to the first measurement goals. (Ord. 18-99 § 17, 1999).


12.16.160 Program exemption credit.

Affected employers may apply for program exemption credit for the results of past or current TDM efforts by applying to the city within 90 days of adoption of the applicable CTR ordinance, or as part of any annual report. Application shall include results from a survey of employees, or equivalent information that establishes the applicant’s VMT per employee and proportion of SOV trips. The survey or equivalent information shall conform to all applicable standards established in the CTR task force guidelines. Employers that apply for credit and whose VMT per employee and proportion of SOV trips are equal to or less than goals for one or more future goal years, and commit in writing to continue their current level of effort, shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter except for the requirements to report performance in the measurement years. If any of these reports indicate the employer does not satisfy the next applicable goal(s), the employer shall immediately become subject to all requirements of the CTR ordinance. (Ord. 18-99 § 18, 1999).


12.16.170 Compliance.

For purposes of this section, “compliance” means fully implementing in good faith all provisions in an approved CTR program. (Ord. 18-99 § 19, 1999).


12.16.180 Program modification criteria.

The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of SOV trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:

(1) If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to modify its CTR program.

(2) If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met or is not likely to meet the applicable SOV or VMT goal, the city/county shall work collaboratively with the employer to make modifications to its CTR program. After agreeing on modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description to the city/county for approval within 30 days of reaching agreement.

(3) If an employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable SOV or VMT reduction goal, the city shall work collaboratively with the employer to identify modifications to the CTR program and shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to incorporate the modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The city shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the city will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the city within 10 working days of the conference. (Ord. 18-99 § 20, 1999).


12.16.190 Violations.

The following constitute violations if the deadlines established in this chapter are not met:

(1) Failure to develop and/or submit on time a complete CTR program, including:

(a) Employers notified or that have identified themselves to the city within 180 days of the ordinance codified in this chapter being adopted and that do not submit a CTR program within 180 days from the notification or self-identification;

(b) Employers not identified or self-identified within 180 days of the ordinance codified in this chapter being adopted and that do not submit or implement a CTR program within 180 days from the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter;

(2) Failure to implement an approved CTR program, unless the program elements that are carried out can be shown through quantifiable evidence to meet or exceed VMT and SOV goals as specified in this chapter;

(3) Failure to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534 and this chapter; or

(4) Failure to revise a CTR program as defined in RCW 70.94.534(4) and this chapter. (Ord. 18-99 § 21, 1999). 


12.16.200 Penalties.

No affected employer with an approved CTR program which has made a good faith effort may be held liable for failure to reach the applicable SOV or VMT goal; each day of failure to implement the program shall constitute a separate violation, subject to penalties as described in Chapter 7.80 RCW. The city administrator shall prepare a schedule of fines. An affected employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they:

(1) Propose to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and

(2) Advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by Buckley and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with state law (RCW 70.94.531). (Ord. 18-99 § 22, 1999).


12.16.210 Worksite exemptions.

An affected employer may request Buckley grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of SOV trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by Buckley at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. Buckley shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year. (Ord. 18-99 § 23, 1999).


12.16.220 Employee exemptions.

Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a work site’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. Buckley will use the criteria identified in the CTR task force guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. Buckley shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year. (Ord. 18-99 § 24, 1999).


12.16.230 Modification of CTR program goals.

An affected employer may request that Buckley modify its CTR program goals. Such requests shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description or annual report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program. The city will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR task force guidelines. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after city/county approval of its initial program description or annual report. (Ord. 18-99 § 25, 1999).


12.16.240 Appeals.

Affected employers may appeal administrative decisions to the city council by submitting a written request for such an appeal to the city administrator within 20 calendar days of the administrative decision. (Ord. 18-99 § 26, 1999).


Chapter 12.50 LANDMARK DESIGNATION

Sections:

12.50.005    Purpose.

12.50.010    Property eligible for special tax valuation.

12.50.015    Authority of Pierce County landmarks commission.

12.50.020    Criteria for inclusion on Pierce County register of historic places.

12.50.025    Procedures.

12.50.030    Intergovernmental agreement.

12.50.035    Demolition or alteration of historic structures.


12.50.005 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures by which property owners of qualifying property may apply to be placed on the Pierce County register of historic places. Placement on the register allows owners who have substantially rehabilitated the property according to state and county standards to apply for a special tax valuation through the Pierce County assessor’s office. This chapter establishes a process whereby the Pierce County landmarks commission (“landmarks commission”) has authority to determine if buildings, structures or places are eligible for placement on the register, in accordance with the commission’s procedures. It also establishes the landmarks commission as the “local review board” for purposes related to the special valuation for qualifying historic properties within the city limits and establishes procedures for the process. (Ord. 36-98 § 2, 1998).


12.50.010 Property eligible for special tax valuation.

The class of historic property which shall be eligible for special valuation in accordance with the Chapter 84.76 RCW (“State Act”) shall be property which is a historic property meeting the criteria or requirements set forth and defined in the State Act, and which is listed in the national or state register of historic places or placed on the Pierce County register of historic places and which has undergone qualifying rehabilitation work within state standards. (Ord. 36-98 § 3, 1998).


12.50.015 Authority of Pierce County landmarks commission.

Owners of buildings, structures or places located within the city who desire to have their property placed on the Pierce County register of historic places shall petition the landmarks commission, via the building department, in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter. Such requests shall follow applicable county procedures, with landmark commission decisions transmitted to the county council for final ordinance action. The landmarks commission shall also act as the “local review board,” as set forth in Chapter 84.26 RCW, for the special valuation of historic properties within the city limits. Landmarks commission decisions on special valuation requests shall be transmitted to the Buckley city council prior to being forwarded to the county assessor for final action. (Ord. 36-98 § 4, 1998).


12.50.020 Criteria for inclusion on Pierce County register of historic places.

The criteria used to evaluate historic properties for possible inclusion in the Pierce County register are based on those used for the national and Washington State registers. These criteria are designed to serve as guidelines for all persons or organizations preparing a designation request to the Pierce County commission.

(1) The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects of state and local importance that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association, and:

(a) That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or

(b) That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

(c) That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or

(d) That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in pre-history or history.

(2) Cemeteries, birthplaces or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original location, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years can also be considered eligible for the Pierce County register. However, greater priority will be given to those which fall within the following categories:

(a) A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance;

(b) A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event;

(c) A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is not an appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive life;

(d) A cemetery which derived its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events;

(e) A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived;

(f) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical significance;

(g) A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.

(3) Below are categories of properties eligible for the Pierce County register:

(a) Historic structures or sites in which the cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state, or local community is best exemplified and from which the visitor may understand the patterns of American and Pierce County heritage. Integrity is an essential basis for deserving recording;

(b) Sites and groupings representing historic community developments and patterns (one-room schools, county seats, crossroads, stores, agricultural settlements, seaports, railroad and water transportation);

(c) Early or abandoned transportation facilities (lighthouses, covered bridges, ships, ferries, railroad stations, milestones, trails);

(h) Structures or sites of pre-historic or historic archaeological significance.

(4) Archaeological properties do not have to be large, impressive or rich in artifacts or categories of date to qualify for the Pierce County register. They do not have to be suitable for public interpretation. Any archaeological resource is potentially eligible if it can be legitimately argued that it is associated with a cultural pattern, process or activity important to the history or prehistory of its locality, the United States or humanity as a whole.

(5) Some properties that have little significance as individual entities may be eligible as segments or archaeological districts. In some cases, an archaeological property or district may also qualify because of an association with a particular event or person, or on the basis of its intrinsic historicity or utility as an interpretive location. Properties that have lost their integrity by being completely excavated or otherwise totally disturbed do not normally qualify, unless they are of particularly noteworthy historical significance for the data they have yielded. (Ord. 36-98 § 5, 1998).


12.50.025 Procedures.

Owners of buildings, structures or places located within the city shall follow these procedures to apply for inclusion on the Pierce County register of historic places and/or designation to receive special valuation as a qualifying historic property which has undergone substantial rehabilitation in accordance with state standards.

(1) Nomination to Registration of Historic Places. Applications shall be filed with the city building department. A $1,000 deposit fee and any necessary accompanying information shall be submitted with the application. The building department shall review the request given the criteria specified in BMC 12.50.020, and, following the review, transmit the application to the landmarks commission for review. The transmittal to the landmarks commission shall be processed in accordance with Pierce County Code Chapter 2.88.

(2) Special Valuation Taxation Requests. Applications shall be initially filed with the county assessor’s office in accordance with the procedures established by that office. The assessor’s office shall transmit the applications to the landmarks commission which shall function as the local review board for such requests. The landmarks commission decision on special valuation taxation requests shall be transmitted to the city council for action. Upon city council approval, city staff shall execute and record covenant agreements with the owners establishing the status of the property. Subsequently, the case shall be transmitted back to the assessor’s office for final processing. (Ord. 36-98 § 6, 1998).


12.50.030 Intergovernmental agreement.

The city shall enter into an intergovernmental agreement with Pierce County establishing specific procedures by which applications from the city will be processed by Pierce County.

12.50.035 Demolition or alteration of historic structures.

No permit shall be issued by the city for the demolition or alteration of part or all of any building, structure, place or district which has been formally designated on the county register of historic places prior to its referral to the landmarks commission. The city administrator shall have the authority to waive this referral requirement for minor alterations which do not materially affect any qualities of the property which led to its placement on the historic register. For those permits which are referred, the landmarks commission shall have 60 days to review and/or recommend modifications to the permit proposal. The purpose of such review will be to determine whether the changes set forth in the proposal permit application are compatible with the inclusion of the structure, building or place on the register. (Ord. 36-98 § 8, 1998).

“Concurrency facilities” mean public facilities for which this chapter requires concurrency.

“Developer” means anyone who engages in development. 

“Development” means any construction or expansion of a building or structure, or change of land use, that creates additional demand for public facilities.

“Development permit” means a building permit, conditional use permit, preliminary plat, rezone, shoreline permit, short plat, or other land use permit.

“Facilities” means land, buildings, structures, and equipment.

The concurrency requirement shall apply to streets, water, and sanitary sewer. (Ord. 06-01 § 1, 2001).


12.100.040 Applicability – Developments.

All developments are subject to a concurrency check except:

(1) Single-family homes, duplexes, and accessory dwelling units;

(2) Developments which create no additional impact on any concurrency facility;

(3) Additions or accessory structures which do not intensify the land use or increase the applicable unit of measure (i.e., square feet for nonresidential construction or number of dwelling units for residential construction);

(1) Concurrency shall be verified prior to issuance of any city development permit.

(2) The planning director shall administer this chapter and shall consult with the respective city departments or facility providers as necessary to check for concurrency and account for available and committed capacity.

(3) If concurrency cannot be verified, the developer may modify the development to reduce the need for concurrency facilities or arrange with the facility provider for capacity to be increased.

(4) Verifications of concurrency shall run with the land and are not transferable to other developments or other properties.

(5) A verification of concurrency shall expire if the accompanying development permit or facility connection agreement expires.

(6) If the accompanying development permit or facility connection agreement expires, or if the developer withdraws its application, the committed facility capacity shall be returned to the pool of available capacity. (Ord. 06-01 § 1, 2001).


12.100.060 Relationship to impact fees.

The payment of impact fees does not guarantee concurrency, and shall not substitute for a verification of concurrency. (Ord. 06-01 § 1, 2001).


12.100.070 Appeals.

The manner in which concurrency is administered may be appealed to the city council by filing a written appeal with the city clerk within 14 calendar days of completion of the concurrency check. (Ord. 06-15 § 21, 2015; Ord. 06-01 § 1, 2001).

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures, notice requirements and fees for the vacation of streets and alleys within the city. This chapter is intended to implement the authority granted to the city by Chapter 35.79 RCW and RCW 35A.47.020 and to conform to their provisions. In case of conflict between this chapter and those statutes, the statutory provisions shall be controlling. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.020 Initiation of vacation.

The owners of an interest in any real property abutting upon any street or alley who may desire to vacate the street or alley, or any part thereof, may petition the city council. In the alternative, the city council may itself initiate a vacation by resolution. The petition or resolution shall be filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.030 Petition for vacation.

The petition shall be in a form prescribed by the director of public works and shall contain a name, address and telephone number of a representative for the petitioners. The petition shall also discuss the criteria set forth in BMC 13.25.110. The sufficiency of the petition shall be governed by RCW 35A.01.040. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).

Every petition for the vacation of any street or alley or any part thereof shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount established by resolution of the city to defray a portion of the administrative costs incurred in processing the petition and publishing, posting and mailing notices.

(e) A title search sufficient to indicate whether the street or alley nominated for vacation was created by easement or dedication.

(2) Flagging which indicates the boundaries of the street or alley shall be installed when the survey is conducted. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.060 Setting of hearing.

Upon receipt of the petition, the fee and all required documents, the city clerk shall forward the petition and required documents to the director of public works, or the director’s designee, who shall determine whether the petition has been signed by the owners of more than two-thirds of the property abutting the part of the street or alley to be vacated. If the petition has been signed by the requisite percentage of such owners, the director of public works, or the director’s designee, shall bring the petition before the city council within 30 days of receipt of the petition, and the city council shall by resolution fix the time when the petition will be heard by the city council, or a committee of the city council, which time shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 20 days after the adoption of the resolution. Where the city council initiates the vacation by resolution, that resolution shall fix the time when the proposed vacation will be heard by the city council or a committee of the city council. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.070 Staff report.

The public works department shall prepare a report concerning the proposed vacation, which report shall address the criteria (see BMC 13.25.110) to be considered by the city council in determining whether to vacate the street or alley, and such other information as deemed appropriate by the public works department. In preparing the report, the public works department shall solicit comments from the department of planning and community development and the police department, and may solicit comments from other governmental agencies and utility companies having jurisdiction or utilities within the boundaries of the city. The report shall be submitted to the city council, or the city council committee hearing the matter, and to the representative of the petitioners, not less than five days before the hearing. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.080 Notice of hearing.

Upon the passage of the resolution fixing the time for hearing the petition or proposal for vacation, the city clerk, or the director of public works, acting under direction and supervision of the city clerk, shall give not less than 20 days’ notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing by (1) publishing written notice once in the city’s official newspaper, (2) posting a placard in a conspicuous place at each end of the street or alley sought to be vacated, and (3) mailing written notice to all petitioners at the addresses on the petition and all owners of property abutting the street or alley proposed to be vacated, as shown on the records of the Pierce County assessor.

13.25.110 City council decision.

Following the hearing and receipt of the committee report, if applicable, the city council shall determine whether to vacate the street or alley. The determination shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of the following criteria: 

(1) Whether a change of use or vacation of the street or alley will better serve the public; 

(2) Whether the street or alley is no longer required for public use or public access; 

(3) Whether the substitution of a new and different public way would be more useful to the public; 

(4) Whether conditions may so change in the future as to provide a greater use or need than presently exists; and 

(5) Whether objections to the proposed vacation are made by owners of private property (exclusive of petitioners) abutting the street or alley or other governmental agencies or members of the general public. 

If the city council determines to grant the vacation, the action shall be made by ordinance with such conditions or limitations as the city council deems necessary and proper to preserve any desired public use or benefit. The ordinance may contain a provision retaining or requiring conveyance of easements for construction, repair and maintenance of existing and future utilities and services. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.120 Vacation of waterfront streets.

(1) The city shall not vacate a street or alley if any portion of the street or alley abuts a body of salt or fresh water unless:

(b) The city council, by resolution, declares that the street or alley is not presently being used as a street or alley and that the street or alley is not suitable for any of the following purposes: port, beach or water access, boat moorage, launching sites, park, public view, recreation, or education; or

(c) The vacation is sought to enable the city to implement a plan, adopted by resolution or ordinance, that provides comparable or improved public access to the same shoreline area to which the street or alley sought to be vacated abuts, had the properties included in the plan not been vacated.

(2) Before adopting an ordinance vacating a street or alley under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the city council shall:

(a) Cause an inventory to be compiled of all rights-of-way within the city that abut the same body of water that is abutted by the street or alley sought to be vacated;

(b) Cause a study to be conducted to determine if the street or alley to be vacated is unsuitable for use by the city for any of the following purposes: port, boat moorage, launching sites, beach or water access, park, public view, recreation, or education;

(c) Hold a public hearing on the proposed vacation in the manner required by Chapter 35.79 RCW and this chapter; and

In the case of vacating an easement, ownership shall revert to the adjacent owner by operation of law and fair market value of the vacated land need not be paid; but all other costs and conditions of vacation pertain.

(5) Moneys received from the vacation of a street or alley abutting a body of fresh or salt water may be used by the city only for the purpose of acquiring additional beach or water access, acquiring additional public view sites to a body of water, or acquiring additional moorage or launching sites. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.130 Reversion, right of first refusal, sale to third persons. 

(1) Where a street or alley has been established as an easement, upon vacation, ownership reverts by operation of law to the adjacent owner, from his lot line to the middle of the street or alley, unless his property is on the perimeter of a subdivision, in which case ownership reverts to the full width of the street or alley.

(2) Where a street or alley has been established by dedication, upon vacation, the owner of the adjacent parcel shall have the right of first refusal to acquire the vacated street or alley to the middle of the street or alley. If the adjacent owner declines the right to acquire the vacated area to the middle of the street, the adjacent owner on the opposite side of the street or alley shall have the right of first refusal to acquire the entire width of the street or alley proposed for vacation.

(1) Where a vacation for a dedicated street or alley which does not abut a body of fresh or salt water has been initiated by petition, the owners of the property abutting the area to be vacated shall pay to the city, prior to the passage of the ordinance vacating the area, the full cost of any physical closures and/or road repairs required by the director of public works and (a) one-half of the fair market value of the area to be vacated; or (b) if area was acquired at public expense or has been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, the full fair market value of the area to be vacated.

(Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.150 Alternative compensation.

(1) Conveyance of other property acceptable to the city may be made in partial satisfaction of or in lieu of the required compensation for the vacation of a street or alley, whether the conveyance is required to mitigate adverse impacts of the vacation or otherwise.

Where the conveyance is made in fee for purposes other than street purposes, the full fair market value of the property conveyed shall be credited to the required compensation payment for the area to be vacated.

(3) Real property may be conveyed in exchange for the vacation of a street or alley that abuts a body of salt or fresh water only where the property to be conveyed is conveyed for port, beach, water access, park, public view, recreation or educational purposes, boat moorage or launching sites, or other public uses, in accordance with BMC 13.25.120(1)(a), or as part of a plan implemented by the city council pursuant to BMC 13.25.120(1)(c).

Where the conveyance is made in fee for purposes other than street purposes, the full fair market value of the property conveyed shall be credited to the required compensation payment for the area to be vacated.

When the value of the conveyed property exceeds the required compensation payment, the city shall pay the difference to the owners of the conveyed property. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).


13.25.160 Appraisals.

(1) The director of public works shall determine the fair market value of the dedicated area to be vacated based upon an appraisal from a Washington State licensed and certified real estate appraiser. To obtain such appraisal, the director of public works shall present to the petitioners a list of three such licensed, certified and designated appraisers from which the petitioners shall select one appraiser. The petitioner shall pay all costs associated with the appraisal. 

(2) If the director of public works is not satisfied with the appraisal submitted by the petitioners under subsection (1) of this section, the director may order a second appraisal from a Washington State licensed and certified real estate appraiser. The city shall pay for this second appraisal. The director of public works shall use the appraisal having the highest value for the area vacated. 

(3) The director of public works shall determine the fair market value of the real property proposed to be granted or dedicated to the city in partial satisfaction of or in lieu of cash payment under BMC 13.25.150 in accordance with the appraisal procedures set forth in this section.

At least one-half of the received compensation shall be dedicated to the acquisition, improvement, development and related maintenance of public open space and/or transportation capital projects within the city; provided, that all compensation for the vacation of streets and alleys which abut a body of water shall be deposited in a fund designated for the sole purpose of acquiring additional beach or water access, additional public view sites to a body of water, or additional moorage or launching sites. Any compensation received by the city which is not dedicated to public open space or transportation capital projects or to the acquisition of additional water access, view sites or launching sites shall be deposited into the street fund. The city treasurer shall make a written report of the payment to the city council.

If the petitioners have been authorized to deliver an instrument granting or dedicating to the city property in addition to or in lieu of a cash payment pursuant to BMC 13.25.140 or 13.25.150, the director of public works may, at the petitioner’s expense, obtain either a policy of title insurance insuring title of the conveyed property in the city, or a certificate of title as to the title thereof. Upon the director of public works’ receipt of such policy or certificate, the director of public works shall transmit the policy or certificate to the city council. (Ord. 02-08 § 1, 2008).

(8) No towing of vehicles shall occur unless the signs are placed at least 72 hours prior to the beginning of the restricted parking.

(9) All signs must be approved by the director prior to placement, and must conform generally to the following wording:

The city may either have employees of the city do the work or make the improvements, or have a contractor do the work or make the improvements. If the city uses the deposit as provided by this section, the applicant shall be notified in writing within four working days of the commencement of emergency work. The notice must state the work that was completed and the nature or timing of the emergency that necessitated the use of the deposit without prior notification.

Prior to the issuance of such a permit, the homeowner or tenant shall be required to provide proof of homeowner’s or renter’s insurance in the amount of at least $100,000 for bodily injury and property damage unless, in the director’s discretion, this requirement is waived after consideration of the nature of the proposed use or work and the need to reasonably protect the city’s interest as well as the health, safety, and welfare of the public. (Ord. 12-17 § 4, 2017; Ord. 14-15 § 1, 2015; Ord. 13-13 § 1, 2013).


13.35.240 Hold harmless.

(8) All customers, other than single-family residences, when required by the purveyor, agree to submit a cross-connection control resurvey of the premises by a purveyor-approved and Department of Health-certified cross-connection control specialist (CCS). The purveyor may require the resurvey to be performed in response to changes in customer’s plumbing, or performed periodically (annually or less frequently) where the purveyor considers the customer’s plumbing system to be complex or subject to frequent changes in water use. The cost of the resurvey shall be borne by the customer.

(9) Residential customer shall agree to complete and submit to the purveyor a “Water Use Questionnaire” within 30 days of a request by the purveyor, for the purpose of surveying the health hazard posed by the customer’s plumbing system on the purveyor’s water system. Further, the residential customer agrees to provide within 30 days of a request by the purveyor a cross-connection control survey of the premises by a purveyor-approved and Department of Health-certified cross-connection control specialist (CCS).

(10) The customer agrees to obtain the prior approval from the purveyor for all changes in water use and any alterations or additions to the plumbing system; and shall comply with any additional requirements imposed by the purveyor for cross-connection control.

(11) The customer agrees to immediately notify the purveyor and the local health department of any backflow incident occurring within the premises (i.e., entry into the potable water of any contaminant or pollutant) and shall cooperate fully with the purveyor to determine the reason for the backflow incident.

(12) The customer acknowledges the right of the purveyor to discontinue water supply within 72 hours of giving notice, or a lesser period of time if required to protect the public health if:

(a) The customer fails to cooperate with the purveyor in the survey of premises, or in the installation, maintenance, repair, inspection or testing of backflow prevention assemblies or air gaps required by the purveyor; or

(b) It is necessary in the purveyor’s effort to contain a contaminant or pollutant that is detected in the customer’s system.

(13) The purveyor may install a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPBA) on the service pipe to provide premises isolation in lieu of discontinuing water service. The customer acknowledges the right of the purveyor to recover all costs associated with the installation and subsequent maintenance and repair of the assembly, appurtenances and enclosure from the customer as fees and charges for water. The failure of the customer to pay these fees and charges may result in termination of service in accordance with the purveyor’s water billing policies.

(14) The purveyor shall require premises isolation for a customer that falls within any category for “Mandatory Premises Isolation” established by the Department of Health regulations (Table 9, found in WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)).

(15) The customer acknowledges his obligation to comply with the other cross-connection control regulations having jurisdictions (e.g., plumbing code requirements) when:

(a) The purveyor imposes mandatory premises isolation in compliance with Department of Health regulations; or

(b) The purveyor agrees to the customer’s voluntary premises isolation through the installation of a reduced pressure backflow assembly immediately downstream of the purveyor’s water meter.

(16) Although the purveyor’s requirements for installation, testing and repair of backflow prevention assemblies may be limited to the approved backflow prevention assemblies used for premises isolation, the customer agrees to the other terms herein as a condition of allowing a direct connection to the purveyor’s service pipe.

(17) The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the purveyor for all contamination of the customer’s plumbing system or the purveyor’s distribution system that results from an unprotected or inadequately protected cross-connection within the customer’s premises. This indemnification shall pertain to all backflow conditions that may arise from the purveyor’s suspension of water supply or reduction of water pressure, recognizing that the air gap separation otherwise required would require the customer to provide adequate facilities to collect, store and pump water for his premises.

(18) The customer agrees that, in the event legal action is required and commenced between the purveyor and the customer to enforce the terms and conditions herein, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all its costs and expenses including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by the court.

(19) The customer acknowledges that the purveyor’s survey of a customer’s premises is for the sole purpose of establishing the purveyor’s minimum requirements for the protection of the purveyor’s water system, commensurate with the purveyor’s assessment of the degree of hazard.

It shall not be assumed by the customer, or any regulatory agency, that the purveyor’s water use survey, requirements for the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, lack of requirements for the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, or other actions by purveyor personnel constitute an approval of the customer’s plumbing system, or an assurance to the customer of the absence of cross-connections therein.

(20) The customer acknowledges the right of the purveyor, in keeping with changes to state regulations, industry standards, or the purveyor’s risk management policies, to impose retroactive requirements for additional cross-connection control measures.

(21) The purveyor shall record the customer’s agreement to the above terms for service on an “Application for Water Service,” “Application for Change of Water Service” or other such form prepared by the purveyor and signed by the customer. (Ord. 12-19 § 2, 2019).

(2) The city may enter into agreements with users to accept pollutants compatible with the treatment system at greater than domestic strengths. Within such agreements, the city may establish terms of the user’s discharge to the POTW including, but not limited to, maximum flow rates and concentrations. The city may also establish fees to recover costs associated with treating such wastes and monitoring schedules in such agreements. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement including categorical standards.

(3) Users discharging or intending to discharge pollutants other than BOD and TSS, and claiming compatibility, must prove to the satisfaction of the city that such pollutants are compatible with the POTW. The city may require any claim of compatibility to be endorsed by Ecology.

(4) The city may assist, by arrangement or formal agreement, agencies that regulate hazardous wastes and materials, and air emissions from users in order to maximize state, county, and city resources.

(5) The city specifically may arrange to act as an agent of Ecology to determine compliance with treatment or disposal requirements and inspect on-site disposal activities and shipping documents. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

(3) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The user shall maintain the facility, sampling, and measuring equipment at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at his/her own expense.

(4) All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable city development standards and specifications. At a minimum, the monitoring equipment shall include an inspection/sampling manhole with an internal diameter of no less than 48 inches and a surface opening of no less than 24 inches. Any devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be regularly calibrated to ensure their accuracy. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.500 Access and inspections.

(1) If the city or an inspector acting as its agent has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect, as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder or any wastewater discharge permit issued by Ecology, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city administrator shall seek access to the property or building through the Pierce County superior court.

(2) In the event the city administrator has reason to believe a situation represents an imminent threat to public health and safety, and where entry has been denied or the area is inaccessible, an agent of the city may enter in the company of a uniformed police officer in order to determine if the suspected situation exists, and if so, to take such actions necessary to protect the public. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.510 Vandalism.

No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article IX. Confidential Information


14.06.520 Confidential information.

(1) Records kept by the city with respect to the nature and frequency of discharges from any user shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city administrator, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to confidentiality under the law.

(2) Users shall clearly mark “confidential” on all area of reports requested to be held confidential from the public. Upon request for this information, the city superintendent shall determine if such information is legally afforded this protection under the law. Only information marked “confidential,” which the city superintendent determines qualifies as such, shall be withheld from the public.

(3) Documents claimed as “confidential,” however, shall not be withheld from any state or federal agency responsible for oversight of the city’s NPDES permit or authority to implement the NPDES, or federal or state pretreatment programs. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR  2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article X. Administrative Enforcement Remedies


14.06.530 State responsibility for administrative actions.

The Washington State Department of Ecology is charged with permitting and regulating significant industrial users of the city’s POTW. Except for emergency actions, the city shall coordinate actions in regard to control of such users with Ecology. Failure to do so, however, shall not invalidate any action of the city authorized by this chapter. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.540 Notification of violation.

(1) When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. The city may select any means of service which is reasonable under the circumstances.

(2) Within 10 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.550 Consent orders.

(1) The city is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such consent orders shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time schedule also specified by the consent order.

(2) Compliance schedules, when included in consent orders, may not extend the compliance date beyond any applicable state or federal deadlines. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to BMC 14.06.560 and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.560 Compliance orders.

(1) Whenever the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the city or applicable control authority may issue a compliance order to the user responsible for the violation directing that, following a specified time period, wastewater services, including collection and treatment, may be discontinued and/or applicable penalties imposed unless adequate pretreatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated and maintained.

(2) Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the installation of pretreatment facilities, additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged into the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance beyond any applicable state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 

(3) Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a compliance order by the user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or for any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the city. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.570 Administrative hearing.

(1) A user shall be afforded the opportunity to have or participate in an administrative hearing before the city council to contest the city’s determination to impose penalties, recover costs, or establish compliance schedules. A user shall also have the right to a hearing prior to termination of a user’s wastewater services.

(2) Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served on an authorized representative of the user (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing.

(3) An administrative hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.580 Cease and desist orders.

(1) When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order by Ecology, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur and may cause a violation of the POTW’s NPDES permit, the city may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:

(a) Immediately cease such actions or discharges as described.

(b) Comply with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(c) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

(2) Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.590 Emergency suspension of wastewater services.

(1) The city or applicable control authority may immediately suspend wastewater services including collection and treatment, after notice to the user, if it appears to the city that such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to either the environment, normal operation of the POTW, or the health or welfare of any person or the general public.

(2) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately cease all wastewater discharges. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or temporary suspension of water service, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or the danger to the public. The city may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in BMC 14.06.600 are initiated against the user.

(3) No person shall attempt to prevent the city from terminating wastewater services in an emergency situation, by barring entry, by physically interfering with city employees or contractors, or by any other means.

(4) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing authorized by this chapter.

(5) Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this article.

(6) Any suspension of wastewater services, emergency or otherwise, shall include notification to the local health department as shown below:

TACOMA-PIERCE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT

3629 SOUTH D STREET

TACOMA, WA 98418-6813

(Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.600 Termination of treatment services (nonemergency).

(1) The city shall have authority to terminate wastewater services, including collection and conveyance to the treatment plant, for any user upon determining that such user has:

(a) Refused access as allowed by this chapter thereby preventing the implementation of any purpose of this chapter. 

(b) Violated any provision of this chapter including the discharge prohibitions and standards of Article IV.

(c) Violated any lawful order of the city issued with respect to this chapter.

(2) For users holding permits to discharge to the POTW, violation of any of the following conditions is also grounds for terminating discharge services:

(a) Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents and characteristics.

(b) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents or characteristics.

(c) Violation of any condition of the user’s waste discharge permit.

(3) Any suspension of wastewater services, emergency or otherwise, shall include notification to the local health district as shown below:

TACOMA-PIERCE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT

3629 SOUTH D STREET

TACOMA, WA 98418-6813

(Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article XI. Judicial Enforcement Remedies


14.06.610 Injunctive relief.

When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may petition the Pierce County superior court through the city’s retained counsel for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.620 Civil penalties.

(1) A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement not reserved by a permit by Ecology shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, penalties shall accrue for each day a violation occurs.

(2) In addition to the penalty amounts assessable under subsection (1) of this section, the city may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city including penalties for noncompliance with the city’s NPDES permit to the extent attributable to the user.

(3) The city shall petition the Pierce County superior court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In recommending the amount of civil liability, the city shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires, and shall present this analysis as evidence in support of the recommended penalty.

(4) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.630 Remedies nonexclusive.

The provisions in Articles X through XII of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions concurrently or sequentially against a noncompliant user or to take other actions as warranted by the circumstances. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article XII. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations


14.06.640 General prohibited discharge standards.

(1) The city may allow an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in BMC 14.06.250(1), (2)(c) and (2)(g). Such defense requires the user to prove to the satisfaction of the city that:

(a) The user did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference;

(b) The discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit; and

(c) In the case of interference, the user was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

(2) This defense does not relieve the user from responsibility for enforcement to recover costs. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.650 Upset.

(1) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the pretreatment facility is reduced, lost, or otherwise fails.

(2) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:

(a) An upset occurred; the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; and it was not due to improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation;

(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

(c) The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written report must follow within five days:

(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

(3) Users will only have the opportunity for a judicial determination on a claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. In any such enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.660 Bypass.

(1) A user may allow a bypass to occur if it does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, and if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operations. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

(2) Requirements for Bypasses Subject to Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.

(a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible;

(b) An industrial user shall give verbal notification to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours of becoming aware of the bypass, and submit a written report to the city within five days of becoming aware of the bypass;

(c) The written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report if the verbal notification has been received within 24 hours.

(3) Exceptions. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life or personal injury;

(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and

(c) The user submitted notices as required under subsection (2) of this section.

(4) The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, and that the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (3) of this section. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article XIII. Charges and Fees


14.06.670 Purpose.

(1) The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city’s pretreatment program.

(2) These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other rates or charges for sewer services; provided, that the city shall collect said charges in the same manner as other sewer utility rates are collected, including, but not limited to, the sewer lien procedures provided under Chapter 35.67 RCW.

(g) Fees for high strength waste and industrial process flow; and

(h) Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein.

(4) All fees or charges will be collected by direct billing. Unless the city has been made aware of extenuating circumstances that would prevent prompt payment, all fees are payable within 30 days of the billing. Fees past due will be considered a violation of this chapter. Users not paying fees within 60 days of the billing period may be subject to termination of service. The city may change existing or adopt new fees. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

Article XIV. Miscellaneous Provisions


14.06.680 Severability.

The provisions of this chapter are severable, and if any provision of this chapter, or application of any provision of this chapter to any circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of this chapter, shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).


14.06.690 Regulatory conflicts.

All other chapters and parts of other chapters inconsistent or conflicting with any part of this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict. (Ord. 04-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010).

14.08.040 Payment of fees.

(1) All charges and/or fees for sanitary sewage disposal services are due and payable at the office of the city administrator by the fifteenth of every month (due date). If payment is not received within five days of the due date, the account shall become delinquent. On or about the first of every month a notice shall be sent to the customer noting the balance due, including any penalties and interest. After the city sends a notice of delinquency on the account, the customer must pay any delinquent amounts within 15 days or service may be disconnected. Any sanitary sewage disposal service account that has been deemed delinquent shall be assessed a late penalty of five percent of the delinquent amount. The utility billing clerk shall, not later than the fifteenth day of each following month, furnish to the public works director a list of all sanitary sewage disposal service accounts that are delinquent. After sanitary sewage disposal service accounts become delinquent, the public works director shall cause to be shut off water service to the premises affected by such delinquency and the water service shall not be turned on again until all, or if less, at least 12 months of delinquent charges and fees, including a fee established by resolution of the city council for the cost of issuing the shut-off notice and dispatching the city crew, shall be paid in full to the city administrator’s office.

(2) The city administrator is authorized to waive all or any portion of the penalties and interest if the administrator determines that late payment was the result of excusable neglect or extreme hardship. (Ord. 04-19 § 3, 2019; Ord. 15-10 § 4, 2010; Ord. 05-09 § 4, 2009; Ord. 581 § 3, 1953).

(1) All charges for sewer service for connections therefor and all charges for late fees and penalties for administration of shut-off notices for water, together with penalties and interest provided in this chapter, shall be liened upon the property to which such connections are made or sewer service furnished, superior to all other liens and encumbrances whatsoever, except for those for general taxes, and local and special assessments. Such liens shall be enforced in the manner provided by law.

(2) All charges for sanitary sewage disposal service and for connections thereto, together with penalties and interest thereon as provided in this title and by statute, shall be a lien upon the property to which such connection is made or such service furnished, superior to all other liens or encumbrances except those for general taxes, special assessments, and city water service. A sewer lien shall be effective for a total not to exceed one year’s delinquent service charges without the necessity of any writing or recording of the lien with the county auditor. Enforcement and foreclosure of any sewer lien shall be in the manner provided by state law.

(3) As an additional and concurrent method of enforcing a sewer lien authorized by this section and state law, the city may shut off the water service to the premises to which such sewer service was furnished or connections made after the charges became delinquent and unpaid, until the charges are paid, subject to the conditions set forth in state law.

(4) All charges for water service shall be a lien upon the premises and shall be enforceable by shutting off water service until the delinquent bill is paid, subject to the conditions set forth in state law.

14.12.030    Oversizing and additional length reimbursement.

14.12.040    Expense reimbursement.


14.12.010 Location of water, sewer and storm sewer main extensions.

Whenever water, sewer and storm sewer mains are extended, main extensions shall also be extended along or through the property being served by the extension so that utility service can be provided to other properties beyond the property being served. The specific location of the extension through or along the property shall be determined by the city at the time of application and shall conform to the city’s water, sewer and storm and surface water system plans for the area where the property is located. Generally, main extensions shall be required along the full frontage of rights-of-way adjacent to the property being developed and served by the main extension and may also be required through the property being developed so that utility service can be provided to other properties not fronting the right-of-way. (Ord. 11-06 § 1, 2006).


14.12.020 Abandonment of wells and septic systems.

Existing wells and septic systems shall be abandoned in accordance with applicable state and local laws and regulations at the owner’s expense no later than at the time the property being served by the well or septic system is connected to and receives services from the city’s utility systems; provided, that existing wells may be retained for irrigation use only on the condition that the domestic water connection to the properties to be irrigated by the well water incorporate a reduced pressure backflow assembly in accordance with city standards. (Ord. 11-06 § 1, 2006).


14.12.030 Oversizing and additional length reimbursement.

Water, sewer and storm and surface water main extensions shall be sized and configured in accordance with this municipal code, resolutions and water, sewer and stormwater system plans. However, eight-inch water and sanitary sewer mains will be the smallest lines permitted on public streets. If main extension sizing required by the city engineer exceeds the minimum allowable extension pipe sizing for the project, the city, acting by and through the city engineer, shall reimburse the developer installing the oversized main the differential cost in materials and installation for the greater pipe size. Prior to the installation of the main extension subject to oversizing reimbursement, the developer shall provide the city engineer with certified bids for the cost of minimum allowable extension pipe size as installed and the greater pipe size required by the city engineer as installed for review and approval by the city engineer to determine the differential cost. Additionally, the oversizing reimbursement section may be applied to those situations where the city engineer requests an additional length of pipe to be constructed beyond the minimum allowable pipe length required by the project. The city, acting by and through the city engineer, shall reimburse the developer for the differential cost of the pipe oversizing within 60 days of the final acceptance of the installed main extension. (Ord. 11-06 § 1, 2006).


14.12.040 Expense reimbursement.

Where a water, sewer, or storm and surface water main is extended along a street at the expense of the property owner or owners on one portion of the street only, or where such a line is extended through property not currently served and not contributing to the cost of the line, or when the city extends a water or sanitary sewer main, the person or persons paying the costs of extension of the water, sewer, or storm and surface water main shall be reimbursed by the noncontributing property owners at the time these owners connect to the water, sewer or storm and surface water main, subject to the reimbursement provisions of Chapter 14.14 BMC. (Ord. 11-06 § 1, 2006).

14.14.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement Chapter 35.91 RCW, and to describe the process for a property owner or developer to request the execution of a latecomer agreement with the city council for water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.020 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in this section shall apply throughout this chapter:

(1) “Cost of construction” means the cost incurred for design, acquisition for right-of-way and/or easements, permit and plan review fees, construction (including materials and installation), as required in order to create and install the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances and standards, including the city’s public works standards. The cost of construction shall be documented in writing on final invoices or other documents showing the amounts paid by the owner. The city will not accept written estimates in determining the cost of construction. In the event of a disagreement between the city and the owner concerning the cost of the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities, the city engineer’s determination shall be final.

(2) “Engineer” means the city engineer or his/her designated representative.

(3) “Latecomer agreement” means a written contract between the city and one or more property owners providing for the partial reimbursement of the cost of constructing the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities. The latecomer agreement shall be a standard agreement approved as to form by the city attorney.

(4) “Water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities” means stormwater, sanitary or combination sewers, pumping stations and disposal plants, water mains, hydrants, reservoirs, or appurtenances. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.030 Limitations on latecomer agreement.

The city council may execute a latecomer agreement for water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities with a property owner or developer who constructs water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities:

(1) Within the city or within 10 miles from the city corporate limits, connecting with the city public water, city sewerage system or stormwater system to serve the area in which the real estate is located;

(2) To provide for a period of not to exceed 20 years for the reimbursement of such real estate owners or developers and their assigns by any owner of real estate who did not contribute to the actual cost of such water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities and who subsequently tap into or use the same (the “latecomer”);

(3) To require that the latecomer pay his or her fair pro rata share of the cost of the construction of the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities, including not only those directly connected thereto, but also users connected to laterals or branches connecting thereto;

(4) To be effective as to any owner of real estate not a party to the latecomer agreement so long as such latecomer agreement has been recorded in the office of the Pierce County auditor prior to the time that the latecomer taps into or connects to said water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.040 Effect of latecomer agreement.

No person, firm or corporation shall be granted a permit or be authorized to hook up or use any such water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities or extensions thereof during the period of time set forth in a recorded latecomer agreement without first paying to the city, in addition to any and all other costs and charges assessed for such hook-up or use or for the water lines, sewers and/or stormwater lines constructed in connection therewith, the amount required by the latecomer agreement. Whenever any hook-up or connection is made into a water, sewer and/or stormwater facility subject to a latecomer agreement, without such payment having first been made, the city may remove, or cause to be removed, such unauthorized hook-up or connection and all connecting tile or pipe located in the facility right-of-way and dispose of unauthorized material so removed without any liability whatsoever. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.050 Fees – Application.

A proposed latecomer agreement, including a description of the methodology and the pro rata share for each property, shall be submitted to the city, accompanied by:

(1) A nonrefundable application fee equal to $500.00 to cover the cost of public notification, agreement review, development, and city council process time. No request for a latecomer agreement shall be processed unless such fee has been paid. No fee shall be charged for city-initiated latecomer agreements;

(2) Paper and digital copies of as-built plans stamped by a Washington State licensed engineer or land surveyor;

(3) Bill(s) of sale;

(4) Itemized and quantified list of costs of construction, prepared, stamped and signed by a Washington State licensed civil engineer;

(5) An 18-inch by 24-inch scaled drawing stamped by either a Washington State licensed civil engineer or land surveyor showing the water, sewer and/or stormwater facility size, location and the proposed areas potentially encumbered for this latecomer agreement, including dimensions, tax parcel numbers, sizes of parcels, useful elevations as needed by the city for determining benefit, all existing utility services and appurtenances. The map must also include the method proposed to be used by the owner to determine the assessment, i.e., frontage square footage and zone end termini;

(6) An eight-and-one-half-inch by 11-inch vicinity map showing tax lot numbers and dollar amounts assessed on each lot. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.060 Deadline for submittal of application.

Applications for latecomer agreements shall be submitted to the city for approval after the city notifies the owner that the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities constructed are acceptable to the city for city operation and maintenance. For residential subdivisions, the application shall be submitted prior to final plat approval. For other types of developments not requiring a final plat approval, the application shall be submitted within 30 days after the city notifies the owner that the utilities are acceptable. Failure by the owner to submit a complete application prior to this deadline constitutes a waiver of the ability to request execution of a latecomer agreement with the city. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.070 Administrative fees and recording costs.

The city’s administration fee for a latecomer agreement shall be five percent of the direct construction cost and shall be charged to each latecomer. The owner of the real estate with whom the latecomer agreement is executed shall pay all costs of recording the latecomer agreement with the Pierce County auditor’s office, as required by law. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.080 Assessment method.

The city may use any method of assessment permitted by law including, but not limited to, the front-foot method, the zone end termini method, and square footage method. At the discretion of the city administrator, the city may allow a proportionate payment if only a portion of a property is developed, with the balance to be paid when the rest of the property is developed. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.090 Cost of construction to be examined by city engineer.

The cost of construction of the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities shall be examined by the city engineer, prior to the city council meeting on the latecomer agreement. The city engineer shall provide a recommendation to the council to verify the examination of the cost of construction. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.100 Approval and acceptance of water and/or sewer facilities by city.

All water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities proposed to be accepted for city ownership and maintenance (and later subject to a latecomer agreement) must be located on city-owned property or the necessary easements must be dedicated to the city prior to dedication such that the city may operate, maintain, demolish, reconstruct, improve or expand the water, sewer and/or stormwater facilities in the future. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.110 City council approval and notice.

The city council shall have approval authority over latecomer agreements. Approval shall only be given after a public hearing held by the council or the hearing examiner on the agreement. Proper notice shall be met if the hearing is published in an official city newspaper with due notice sent to the affected property owners 10 days prior to the hearing. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.120 Property owner notification requirement.

Each latecomer agreement shall include a provision requiring that every two years from the date the latecomer agreement is executed a property owner entitled to reimbursement under this section provide the city with information regarding the current contact name, address, and telephone number of the person, company, or partnership that originally entered into the latecomer agreement. If the property owner fails to comply with the notification requirements of this section within 60 days of the specified time, then the city may collect any reimbursement funds owed to the property owner under the latecomer agreement. Such funds shall be deposited in the capital improvement fund of the city. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).


14.14.130 No requirement for execution of latecomer agreement.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the city to enter into such latecomer agreement. Nothing in this chapter requires the city to enter into a latecomer agreement on or after the timelines specified in BMC 14.14.060. (Ord. 10-15 § 2, 2015; Ord. 11-06 § 2, 2006).

14.28.010 Findings of need for utility. 

The city of Buckley finds that:

(1) Stormwater drainage and surface water runoff within the city must be controlled in a manner that mitigates damage to property, erosion of soil, and restriction of natural or manmade watercourses, due to unrestricted sedimentation;

(2) The current level of funding for storm drainage and surface water control in the city is not adequate to meet current and future needs to protect private and public property from damage caused by urban stormwater runoff;

(3) The existing storm drainage and surface water facilities of this city must be adequately maintained, operated, and replaced, through a funding program that is fair and equitable;

(4) The extent of impervious groundcover, which increases the amount and rate of stormwater drainage or surface water runoff from a parcel of property, is the primary factor determining the contribution of each parcel of property to the flow rate and quantity of runoff from such property into the city storm drainage and surface water control systems;

(5) All developed real property within the corporate boundaries of the city contributes runoff to the city’s stormwater drainage system and all developed property benefits from the stormwater management efforts of the city and should participate financially in the payment of all expenses for administration, maintenance, operation, and improvement of such a stormwater drainage system. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 6-92 § 1, 1992).

14.28.120 Service charge.

(1) A surface water management utility service charge is imposed upon every parcel of land with developed impervious surface area within the city of Buckley, excepting only those properties identified as exempt from assessment of a surface water management service charge as specified in this chapter.

(2) This charge is deemed reasonable and is necessary to fund the repair, replacement, operation, maintenance and improvement of all existing and future surface water management facilities, and includes the accumulation of reserves and the retirement of any debt.

(3) Service charges for the surface water management utility shall be established by resolution of the city council.

(4) A minimum of 20 percent of revenues from the surface water management utility service charge shall be deposited into the stormwater capital project fund, which may be appropriated from time to time for the designing and construction of improvements, reconstruction, replacement, extension, or major repair of the city stormwater system. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 13-08 § 17, 2008; Ord. 25-07 § 1, 2007; Ord. 22-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 24-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 01-05 § 2, 2005; Ord. 13-03 § 1, 2003; Ord. 16-01 § 2, 2001).


14.28.125 Alternative commercial service charge.

In the alternative to service charges set forth under BMC 14.28.120 and in order to ensure that nonresidential parcels are not unfairly or disproportionately burdened with the cost of maintaining and operating the surface water management utility, the charge for commercial developed parcels shall be established by resolution of the city council. In the event this conflicts with the charge provided for under BMC 14.28.120, the charge set forth herein shall govern. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 13-08 § 18, 2008; Ord. 25-07 § 2, 2007; Ord. 22-06 § 2, 2006; Ord. 24-05 § 2, 2005; Ord. 10-04 § 1, 2004; Ord. 04-00 § 1, 2000).


14.28.130 Method of calculating service charge.

(1) The city shall determine the number of single-family residential parcels within the city and shall designate each as a single ESU irrespective of the size of the parcel or the amount of impervious area within such a parcel, until such time as the parcel is divided or the use of the land is modified to other than single-family residential use.

(2) The city shall measure the impervious surface of all nonresidential undeveloped parcels in the city, except for those that are exempt from the surface water utility charge as described by BMC 14.28.070. The impervious area will be divided into ESUs, and the number of ESUs will be multiplied by a base rate to determine the surface water management charge assessed against each parcel. Each developed, nonexempt parcel of property shall be deemed to contain a minimum of at least one ESU.

Those properties remaining in an undeveloped condition are deemed not to make use of the services of the surface water management utility beyond that used by such property in a natural state. Therefore, no service charge shall be imposed upon that real property within the boundaries of the city which remains undeveloped. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 6-92 § 1, 1992).


14.28.140 Facilities charge.

For each new development on land, the city shall charge surface water management utility general facilities charges, which charges shall be established by resolution of the city council. The general facility charges for surface water management identified in this section will be automatically increased each year on January 1st, compared to the prior year, by the percentage reflected in the Seattle ENR Construction Cost Index (CCI). (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 13-08 § 19, 2008; Ord. 26-06 § 3, 2006; Ord. 6-92 § 1, 1992).

The surface water management utility service charge for each parcel of real property within the city limits shall be computed on a monthly basis and shall be due with all other utility charges. Revenues collected as surface water management fees shall be deposited in a surface water management fund, as established by this chapter.

Pursuant to RCW 35.67.200, et seq., the city shall have a lien for delinquent and unpaid stormwater sewer charges. A sewer lien shall be effective for a total not to exceed one year’s delinquent service charges without the necessity of any writing or recording of the lien with the county auditor. Enforcement and foreclosure of any sewer lien shall be in the manner provided by state law. Interest on the unpaid balance shall be eight percent per annum or higher rate as authorized by law. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 05-00 § 5, 2000).


14.28.155 Payment of fees.

(1) All surface water management utility service charges are due and payable at the office of the city administrator by the fifteenth of every month (due date). If payment is not received within five days of the due date, the account shall become delinquent. On or about the first of every month a notice shall be sent to the customer noting the balance due, including any penalties and interest. After the city sends a notice of delinquency on the account, the customer must pay any delinquent amounts within 15 days. Any surface water management utility service account that has been deemed delinquent shall be assessed a late penalty of five percent of the delinquent amount.

(2) The city administrator is authorized to waive all or any portion of the penalties and interest if the administrator determines that late payment was the result of excusable neglect or extreme hardship. (Ord. 04-19 § 4, 2019; Ord. 15-10 § 5, 2010; Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 05-09 § 8, 2009).


14.28.160 Adjustment of charge.

Any person who believes that the surface water management charges applied to his or her parcel are inaccurate, or otherwise disagrees with the city’s determination of the surface water management rate applied to his or her parcel, may apply to the utility superintendent for a rate adjustment, stating in writing the grounds for the complaint. The utilities superintendent shall review the appeal and report his findings to the city administrator for evaluation. The city administrator shall consider the appeal and the staff recommendation, and shall determine whether an adjustment is necessary to provide for reasonable and equitable application of the surface water management service charge.

Interest shall be added to any delinquent surface water management utility service fee at the rate of one percent per month.

For purposes of this section, the notice of determination of fees shall be effective upon the date that the city administrator mails his decision to the appellant, postage prepaid to the address of the appellant. Notice of charges shall be the monthly account billing date; provided, that a reduction or increase in charges shall be allowed only from the billing date. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 6-92 § 1, 1992).


14.28.170 General facility charge exemptions.

The city council may consider awarding a property owner/applicant a partial or full exemption/credit from the stormwater general facility charge for one or more of the following reasons:

(1) For the value of the construction of off-site, nonfrontage, stormwater facilities; provided, that the facilities are identified in the list of projects used to determine the impact fee. 

(2) For the value of low impact development measures incorporated into design and construction, which reduces the quantity of runoff and increases the water quality. 

Nothing in this exemption shall be construed to be a waiver of the operation charge for the utility. (Ord. 03-10 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 15-00 § 1, 2000).

14.30.011 Findings of fact.

The city council adopts the findings of the model stormwater management ordinance provided by the Department of Ecology that:

(1) Stormwater pollution is a problem associated with land utilization and development and the common occurrence of potential pollutants such as pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum products, pet wastes and numerous others. Land utilization and development is also known to increase both the volume and duration of peak flows. The resulting erosion, scouring and deposition of sediment affect the ecological balance in the stream. Sedimentation and stormwater pollution cause diversity of species to decrease and allow more tolerant (and usually less desirable) species to remain. Stormwater pollution can cause or contribute to restrictions on public use of the waters within Buckley.

(2) An expanding population and increased development of land have led to: water quality degradation through discharge of nutrients, metals, oil and grease, toxic materials, and other detrimental substances including, without limitation, insect and weed control compounds; drainage and storm and surface water runoff problems within the city; and safety hazards to both lives and property posed by uncontrolled water runoff on streets and highways.

(3) Continuation of present stormwater management practices, to the extent that they exist, will lead to water quality degradation, erosion, and property damage, and endanger the health and safety of the inhabitants of the city.

(4) In the future such problems and dangers will be reduced or avoided if existing properties and future developers, both private and public, provide for stormwater quality and quantity controls.

(5) Stormwater quality and quantity controls can be achieved when land is developed or redeveloped by implementing appropriate best management practices (BMPs).

(6) Best management practices can be expected to perform as intended only when properly designed, constructed and maintained. (Ord. 26-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 19-14 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 03-10 § 2 (Exh. B), 2010; Ord. 25-95 § 1, 1995). 


14.30.012 Need.

The city council adopts the needs set forth in the model stormwater management ordinance provided by the Department of Ecology that this chapter is necessary in order to:

(1) Minimize or eliminate water quality degradation;

(2) Prevent erosion and sedimentation in creeks, streams, ponds, lakes and other water bodies;

Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, roof tops, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots or storage areas, concrete or asphalt pavement, gravel roads, packed earthen materials, and oiled, macadam or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of stormwater. Open, uncovered retention/detention facilities shall not be considered as impervious surfaces for purposes of determining whether the thresholds for application of Minimum Requirements are exceeded. Open, uncovered retention/detention facilities shall be considered impervious surfaces for purposes of runoff modeling.

“Interflow” means that portion of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil and moves laterally through the upper soil horizons until intercepted by a stream channel or until it returns to the surface, for example, in a roadside ditch, wetland, spring or seep. Interflow is a function of the soil system depth, permeability, and water-holding capacity.

“Land clearing” or “clearing” means the destruction or removal of vegetation from a site by physical, mechanical, chemical or other means. This does not mean mowing, landscape maintenance or pruning consistent with accepted horticultural and arboricultural practices, which does not impair the health or survival of the trees and associated vegetation.

“Land disturbing activity” means any activity that results in a movement of earth or a change in the existing soil cover (both vegetative and nonvegetative) and/or the existing soil topography. Land disturbing activities include, but are not limited to, clearing, grading, filling and excavation. Compaction that is associated with stabilization of structures and road construction shall also be considered a land disturbing activity. Vegetation maintenance practices, including landscape maintenance and gardening, are not considered land disturbing activity. Stormwater facility maintenance is not considered land disturbing activity if conducted according to established standards and procedures.

“Low impact development” means a stormwater and land use management strategy that strives to mimic pre-disturbance hydrologic processes of infiltration, filtration, storage, evaporation and transpiration by emphasizing conservation, use of on-site natural features, site planning, and distributed stormwater management practices that are integrated into a project design.

(Ord. 26-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 19-14 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 03-10 § 2 (Exh. B), 2010; Ord. 25-95 § 1, 1995. Formerly 14.30.051). 


14.30.051 Minimum Requirements.

This section identifies the nine Minimum Requirements for stormwater management applicable to new development and redevelopment sites. See the Manual for additional details related to each of the Minimum Requirements.

(1) Minimum Requirement No. 1 – Preparation of Stormwater Site Plans. All projects meeting the thresholds in BMC 14.30.050 shall prepare a Stormwater Site Plan in accordance with Chapter 3 of Volume 1 of the Manual.

(2) Minimum Requirement No. 2 – Construction Stormwater Pollution Prevention (SWPP). All new development and redevelopment shall comply with construction SWPP Element Nos. 1 through 13 below.

Projects in which the new, replaced, or new plus replaced hard surfaces total 2,000 square feet or more or disturb 7,000 square feet or more of land must prepare a construction SWPP plan (SWPPP) as part of the stormwater site plan. Each of the 13 elements must be considered and included in the construction SWPPP unless the director decides that site conditions render the element unnecessary and the exemption from that element is clearly justified in the narrative of the SWPPP.

Projects that add or replace less than 2,000 square feet of hard surface or disturb less than 7,000 square feet of land are not required to prepare a construction SWPPP, but must consider all of the 13 elements of construction stormwater pollution prevention and develop controls for all elements that pertain to the project site.

(a) Element 1 – Preserve Vegetation/Mark Clearing Limits.

(i) Prior to beginning land disturbing activities, including clearing and grading, all clearing limits, sensitive areas and their buffers, and trees that are to be preserved within the construction area should be clearly marked, both in the field and on the plans, to prevent damage and off-site impacts.

(ii) The duff layer, native top soil, and natural vegetation shall be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum degree practicable. Clearing, grading, and other soil disturbances should be limited to the building footprint when possible. Disturbed soils shall be amended with compost to restore or improve upon their original infiltration potential.

(iii) Plastic, metal, or stake wire fence may be used to mark the clearing limits.

(b) Element 2 – Establish Construction Access.

(i) Access Limited. Construction vehicle access and exit shall be limited to one route if possible.

(ii) Tracking Sediment. Access points shall be stabilized with quarry spall or crushed rock or other equivalent BMPs to minimize the tracking of sediment onto public roads.

(iii) Wheel Wash. Wheel wash or tire baths should be located on site, if the stabilized construction entrance is not effective in preventing tracking sediment onto roads.

(iv) Clean Public Roads. Public roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling, pickup, or sweeping and shall be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. Street washing will be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner.

(v) Street Wash Water. Street wash wastewater shall be controlled by pumping back on site, or otherwise be prevented from discharging into systems tributary to state surface waters.

(c) Element 3 – Control Flow Rates.

(i) General. Properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be protected from erosion and the associated discharge of turbid waters due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff from the project site.

(ii) Downstream Analysis. Downstream analysis is necessary if changes in flows could impair or alter conveyance systems, stream banks, bed sediment or aquatic habitat.

(iii) BMPs Functional. Stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be constructed as one of the first steps in grading. Detention facilities shall be functional prior to construction of site improvements (e.g., hard surfaces).

(iv) Additional Flow Standards. The director may require pond designs that provide additional or different stormwater flow control if necessary to address local conditions or to protect properties and waterways downstream from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of stormwater runoff from the project site.

(v) Permanent Infiltration Ponds. If permanent infiltration ponds are used for flow control during construction, these facilities should be protected from siltation during the construction phase.

(d) Element 4 – Install Sediment Controls.

(i) Natural Vegetation. The duff layer, native top soil, and natural vegetation shall be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent practicable.

(ii) Sediment Control Design. Design, install and maintain effective erosion controls and sediment controls to minimize the discharge of pollutants.

(iii) Minimize Sediment Discharges. Minimize sediment discharges from the site. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls must address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle size expected to be present on the site.

(iv) BMPs Functional. Construct sediment control BMPs (sediment ponds, traps, filters, etc.) as one of the first steps in grading. These BMPs shall be functional before other land disturbing activities take place.

(v) Sediment Removal. Direct stormwater runoff from disturbed areas through a sediment pond or other appropriate sediment removal BMP, before the runoff leaves a construction site or before discharge to an infiltration facility. Runoff from fully stabilized areas may be discharged without a sediment removal BMP, but must meet the flow control performance standard in Element No. 3.

(vi) Location. Locate BMPs intended to trap sediment on site in a manner to avoid interference with the movement of juvenile salmonids attempting to enter off-channel areas or drainages.

(vii) Outlet Structures. Where feasible, design outlet structures that withdraw impounded stormwater from the surface to avoid discharging sediment that is still suspended lower in the water column.

(e) Element 5 – Stabilize Soils.

(i) General. All exposed and unworked soils shall be stabilized by application of effective BMPs that prevent erosion. Applicable BMPs include, but are not limited to: temporary and permanent seeding, sodding, mulching, plastic covering, erosion control fabrics and matting, soil application of polyacrylamide (PAM), the early application of gravel base early on areas to be paved, and dust control.

(ii) Volume and Velocity. Control stormwater volume and velocity within the site to minimize soil erosion.

(iii) Stormwater Discharges. Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flow rates and total stormwater volume, to minimize erosion at outlet and to minimize downstream channel and streambank erosion.

(iv) Seasonal Work Limitations. From October 1st through April 30th, no soils shall remain exposed and unworked for more than two days. From May 1st to September 30th, no soils shall remain exposed and unworked for more than seven days.1 This condition applies to all soils on site, whether at final grade or not.

(v) Soil Stabilization. Soil stabilization measures selected should be appropriate for the time of year, site conditions, estimated duration of use, and potential water quality impacts that stabilization agents may have on downstream waters or ground water. Stabilize soils at the end of the shift before a holiday or weekend if needed based on the weather forecast.

(vi) Soil Stockpiles. Soil stockpiles must be stabilized and protected with sediment trapping measures, and where possible, be located away from storm drain inlets, waterways and drainage channels.

(vii) Soil Exposure. Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction activity, minimize disturbance to steep slopes and minimize soil compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil.

(f) Element 6 – Protect Slopes.

(i) Cut and Fill Slopes. Design and construct cut-and-fill slopes in a manner to minimize erosion. Applicable practices include, but are not limited to, reducing continuous length of slope with terracing and diversions, reducing slope steepness, and roughening slope surfaces (for example, track walking).

(ii) Diverted Flows. Divert off-site stormwater (run-on) or ground water away from slopes and disturbed areas with interceptor dikes, pipes and/or swales. Off-site stormwater should be managed separately from stormwater generated on the site.

(iii) Collected Flows. At the top of slopes, collect drainage in pipe slope drains or protected channels to prevent erosion. Temporary pipe slope drains must handle the peak volumetric flow rate calculated using a 10-minute time step from a Type 1A, 10-year, 24-hour frequency storm for the developed condition. Alternatively, the 10-year and one-hour flow rate predicted by an approved continuous runoff model, increased by a factor of 1.6, may be used. The hydrologic analysis must use the existing land cover condition for predicting flow rate from tributary areas outside the project limits. For tributary areas on the project site, the analysis must use the temporary or permanent project land cover condition, whichever will produce the highest flow rates. If using the Western Washington Hydrology Model (WWHM) to predict flows, bare soil areas should be modeled as “landscaped” area.

(iv) Excavation. Excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches, consistent with safety and space considerations.

(v) Check Dams. Check dams shall be placed at regular intervals within constructed channels that are cut down a slope.

(g) Element 7 – Protect Drain Inlets.

(i) General. All storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that stormwater runoff shall not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or treated to remove sediment.

(ii) Storm Drain Inlets. Clean or remove and replace inlet protection devices when sediment has filled one-third of the available storage (unless a different standard is specified by the product manufacturer).

(h) Element 8 – Stabilize Channels and Outlets.

(i) General. All temporary on-site conveyance channels shall be designed, constructed and stabilized to prevent erosion from the following expected peak flows. Channels shall handle the expected peak flow as calculated from a 10-minute time step from a Type 1A, 10-year, 24-hour frequency storm for the developed condition. Alternatively, the 10-year, one-hour flow rate predicted by an approved continuous runoff model, increased by a factor of 1.6, may be used. The hydrologic analysis shall use the existing land cover condition for predicting flow rates from tributary areas outside the project limits. For tributary areas on the project site, the analysis shall use the temporary or permanent project land cover condition, whichever will produce the highest flow rates. If using the Western Washington Hydrology Model to predict flows, bare soil areas should be modeled as “landscaped area.”

(ii) Stabilization. Stabilization, including armoring material, adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes and downstream reaches shall be provided at the outlets of all conveyance systems.

(i) Element 9 – Control Pollutants.

(i) General. All pollutants, including waste materials and demolition debris, that occur on site during construction shall be handled and disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of stormwater.

(ii) Design and Installation. Design, install, implement and maintain effective pollution prevention measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants.

(iii) Vandalism. Cover, containment, and protection from vandalism shall be provided for all chemicals, liquid products, petroleum products, and other materials that have the potential to pose a threat to human health or the environment. On-site fueling tanks must include secondary containment. Secondary containment means placing tanks or containers within an impervious structure capable of containing 110 percent of the volume contained in the largest tank within the containment structure. Double-walled tanks do not require additional secondary containment.

(iv) Equipment Maintenance. Conduct maintenance, fueling, and repair of heavy equipment and vehicles using spill prevention and control measures. Clean contaminated surfaces immediately following any spill incident.

(v) Wheel Wash. Wheel wash, or tire bath wastewater, shall be discharged to a separate on-site treatment system that prevents discharge to surface water, such as closed-loop recirculation or upland application, or to the sanitary sewer, only if expressly allowed by the local sewer district authority.

(vi) Agricultural Chemicals. Application of fertilizers and pesticides shall be conducted in a manner and at application rates that will not result in loss of chemical to stormwater runoff. Manufacturers’ recommendations shall be followed for application rates and procedures.

(vii) pH Management. Management of pH-modifying sources shall prevent contamination of runoff and stormwater collected on the site. These sources include, but are not limited to, bulk cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, new concrete washing and curing waters, waste streams generated from concrete grinding and sawing, exposed aggregate processes, dewatering concrete vaults, and concrete pumping and mixer washout waters. Adjust the pH of stormwater if necessary to prevent violations of water quality standards. Obtain written approval from Ecology before using chemical treatment other than CO2 or dry ice to adjust pH.

(viii) Concrete Washout. Assure that washout of concrete trucks is performed off site or in designated concrete washout areas only. Do not wash out concrete trucks onto the ground, or into storm drains, open ditches, streets, or streams. Do not dump excess concrete on site, except in designated concrete washout areas. Concrete spillage or concrete discharge to surface waters of the state is prohibited.

(j) Element 10 – Control Dewatering.

(i) General. All foundation, vault, and trench dewatering water, which have similar characteristics to stormwater runoff at the site, shall be discharged into a controlled conveyance system, prior to discharge to a sediment trap or sediment pond. Channels must be stabilized, as specified in Element No. 8.

(ii) Clean Water. Clean, nonturbid dewatering water, such as well-point ground water, can be discharged to systems tributary or directly into surface waters of the state, as specified in Element No. 8, provided the dewatering flow does not cause erosion or flooding of the receiving waters. These clean waters should not be routed through sediment ponds with stormwater. Note that “surface waters of the state” may exist on a construction site as well as off site; for example, a creek running through a site.

(iii) Contaminated Water. Highly turbid or otherwise contaminated dewatering water shall be handled separately from stormwater at the site.

(iv) Other Disposal Options. Depending on site constraints, dewatering may include: infiltration; transport off site in vehicle, such as a vacuum flush truck, for legal disposal in a manner that does not pollute state waters; on-site treatment using chemical treatment or other suitable treatment technologies; sanitary sewer discharge with [local sewer district approval] approval if there is no other option, or a sedimentation bag that discharges to a ditch or swale for small volumes of localized dewatering.

(k) Element 11 – Maintain BMPs.

(i) General. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. All maintenance and repair shall be conducted in accordance with BMPs specifications.

(ii) Remove BMPs. All temporary erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary BMPs are no longer needed.

(l) Element 12 – Manage the Project.

(i) Phasing of Construction. Development projects shall be phased where feasible in order to prevent, to the maximum extent practicable, the transport of sediment from the project site during construction. Revegetation of exposed areas and maintenance of that vegetation shall be an integral part of the activities for any phase. Clearing and grading activities for developments shall be permitted only if conducted pursuant to an approved site development plan (e.g., subdivision approval) that establishes permitted areas of clearing, grading, cutting, and filling. When establishing these permitted clearing and grading areas, consideration should be given to minimizing removal of existing trees, especially conifers, and minimizing disturbance/compaction of native soils except as needed for building purposes. These permitted clearing and grading areas and any other areas required to preserve critical or sensitive areas, buffers, native growth protection easements, or tree retention areas as may be required by the director shall be delineated on the site plans and the development site.

(ii) Seasonal Work Limitations. From October 1st through April 30th, clearing, grading, and other soil disturbing activities shall only be permitted if shown to the satisfaction of the director that silt-laden runoff will be prevented from leaving the construction site through a combination of the following:

(A) Site conditions including existing vegetative coverage, slope, soil type and proximity to receiving waters; and

(B) Limitations on activities and the extent of disturbed areas; and

(C) Proposed erosion and sediment control measures.

(iii) Modify Seasonal Limits. Based on the information provided, and/or local weather conditions, the director may expand or restrict the seasonal limitation on site disturbance. If, during the course of any construction activity or soil disturbance during the seasonal limitation period, silt-laden runoff leaving the construction site causes a violation of the surface water quality standard or if clearing and grading limits or erosion and sediment control measures shown in the approved plan are not maintained, the director shall take enforcement action according to BMC 14.30.803.

(iv) Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from the seasonal clearing and grading limitations:

(A) Routine maintenance and necessary repair of erosion and sediment control BMPs;

(B) Routine maintenance of public facilities or existing utility structures that do not expose the soil or result in the removal of the vegetative cover to soil; and

(C) Activities where there is 100 percent infiltration of surface water runoff within the site in approved and installed erosion and sediment control facilities.

(v) Coordination with Other Contractors. The primary project applicant shall evaluate, with input from utilities and other contractors, the stormwater management requirements for the entire project, including the utilities, when preparing the construction SWPPP.

(vi) Inspection. All BMPs shall be inspected, maintained, and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function.

(vii) Certified Professional. A certified erosion and sediment control lead (CESCL) shall be identified in the construction SWPPP and shall be on site or on call at all times. The CESCL shall have the skills to assess the site conditions that could impact the quality of stormwater and the effectiveness of erosion and sediment control measures. They shall examine stormwater visually for the presence of suspended sediment, turbidity, discoloration, and oil sheen. They shall evaluate the effectiveness of BMPs and determine if it is necessary to install, maintain, or repair BMPs to improve the quality of stormwater discharges. Problems shall be corrected by reviewing the SWPPP for compliance with the 13 construction SWPPP elements and making appropriate revisions within seven days of the inspection. The CESCL shall also immediately begin the process of fully implementing and maintaining appropriate source control and/or treatment BMPs as soon as possible, addressing the problems no later than within 10 days of the inspection. If installation of necessary treatment BMPs is not feasible within 10 days, the construction site operator may request an extension within the initial 10-day response period. BMP implementation and maintenance shall be documented in a site log. The CESCL shall inspect all areas disturbed by construction activities, all BMPs, and all stormwater discharge points at least once every calendar week and within 24 hours of any discharge from the site. The CESCL may reduce the inspection frequency for temporary stabilized, inactive sites to once every calendar month.

(viii) Sampling. Sampling and analysis of the stormwater discharges from a construction site may be necessary on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance with standards. Monitoring and reporting requirements may be established by the director when necessary.

(ix) Modify SWPPP. Whenever inspection and/or monitoring reveals that the BMPs identified in the construction SWPPP are inadequate, due to the actual discharge of or potential to discharge a significant amount of any pollutant, the SWPPP shall be modified, as appropriate, in a timely manner.

(x) Construction SWPPP. The construction SWPPP shall be retained on site or within reasonable access to the site. The construction SWPPP shall be modified whenever there is a significant change in the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any BMP.

(m) Element 13 – Protect Low Impact Development BMPs.

(i) General. Protect all bioretention and rain garden BMPs from sedimentation through installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment control BMPs on portions of the site that drain into the bioretention and/or rain garden BMPs. Restore the BMPs to their fully functioning condition if they accumulate sediment during construction. Restoring the BMP must include removal of sediment and any sediment-laden bioretention/raingarden soils, and replacing the removed soils with soils meeting the design specification.

(ii) Compaction. Prevent compacting bioretention and rain garden BMPs by excluding construction equipment and foot traffic. Protect completed lawn and landscaped areas from compaction due to construction equipment.

(iii) Erosion Control. Control erosion and avoid introducing sediment from surrounding land uses onto permeable pavements. Muddy construction equipment shall not be allowed on the base material or pavement. Sediment-laden runoff shall not be allowed onto permeable pavements or base materials.

(iv) Pavement. Pavement fouled with sediments or no longer passing an initial infiltration test must be cleaned using procedures in accordance with this manual or the manufacturer’s procedures.

(v) Heavy Equipment. All heavy equipment shall be kept off existing soils under LID facilities that have been excavated to final grade to retain the infiltration rate of the soils.

(3) Minimum Requirement No. 3 – Source Control of Pollution. All known, available and reasonable source control BMPs shall be applied to all projects. Source control BMPs shall be selected, designed, and maintained according to the Manual.

(4) Minimum Requirement No. 4 – Preservation of Natural Drainage Systems and Outfalls. Natural drainage patterns shall be maintained, and discharges from the project site shall occur at the natural location, to the maximum extent practicable. The manner by which all runoff is discharged from the project site must not cause a significant adverse impact to downstream receiving waters and downgradient properties. All outfalls require energy dissipation.

The manner by which runoff is discharged from the project site must not cause a significant adverse impact to downstream receiving waters and downgradient properties. Downstream properties shall not be unreasonably burdened with increased flow rates, negative impacts or unreasonable changes in manner of flow from upstream properties. Drainage problems shall not be transferred from one location to another. However, downstream properties cannot block natural or existing runoff through their site and shall accept runoff from upstream properties.

Planning and design of drainage systems shall not be based on the premise that stormwater can be transferred from one basin to another unless part of an adopted city regional drainage system plan.

The flow of storm runoff shall be maintained within its natural drainage course unless reasonable use is demonstrated otherwise. When stormwater is discharged into an existing drainage course, the peak discharge into the water course shall not adversely affect or cause damage to property along the drainage course now or in the future based on existing zoning. Erosional impacts due to concentration of flows and increased flow durations shall be evaluated and mitigated.

(5) Minimum Requirement No. 5 – On-Site Stormwater Management. Projects shall employ on-site stormwater management BMPs in accordance with the following projects thresholds, standards, and lists to infiltrate, disperse, and retain stormwater runoff on site to the extent feasible without causing flooding or erosion impacts.

(a) Exemptions. Projects qualifying as flow control exempt in accordance with Minimum Requirement No. 7 (Flow Control) do not have to achieve the LID performance standard, nor consider bioretention, rain gardens, permeable pavement, and full dispersion if using List No. 1 or List No. 2. However, those projects must implement BMP T5.13: Post-Construction Soil Quality and Depth; BMP T5.10A: Downspout Full Infiltration or BMP T5.10B: Downspout Dispersion Systems or BMP T5.10C: Perforated Stub-Out Connections; and BMP T5.11: Concentrated Flow Dispersion or BMP T5.12: Sheet Flow Dispersion, if feasible.

(ii) Projects triggering Minimum Requirements No. 1 through No. 9 shall meet the requirements in Minimum Requirement No. 5: On-Site Stormwater Management. New development and redevelopment shall meet the low impact development performance standard and BMP T5.13: Post-Construction Soil Quality and Depth; or List No. 2 (applicant option).

(c) Low Impact Development Performance Standard. Stormwater discharges shall match developed discharge durations to predeveloped durations for the range of predeveloped discharge rates from eight percent of the two-year peak flow to 50 percent of the two-year peak flow. Refer to the Standard Flow Control Requirement section in Minimum Requirement No. 7 for information about the assignment of the predeveloped condition. Project sites that must also meet Minimum Requirement No. 7 – Flow Control – must match flow durations between eight percent of the two-year flow through the full 50-year flow.

(i) List No. 1: On-Site Stormwater Management BMPs for Projects Triggering Minimum Requirements No. 1 through No. 5. For each surface, consider the BMPs in the order listed for that type of surface. Use the first BMP that is considered feasible. No other on-site stormwater management BMP is necessary for that surface.

(i) Projects in which the total of effective, pollution-generating hard surface (PGIS) is 5,000 square feet or more in a threshold discharge area of the project; or

(ii) Projects in which the total of pollution-generating pervious surfaces (PGPS) – not including permeable pavements – is three-quarters of an acre or more in a threshold discharge area, and from which there is a surface discharge in a natural or manmade conveyance system from the site.

(b) Treatment Facility Sizing. Treatment facilities shall be sized for the entire area that drains to them, even if some of those areas are not pollution-generating, or were not included in the project site threshold decisions of the treatment threshold decisions of this Minimum Requirement.

(i) The water quality design volume shall be predicted from a 24-hour storm with a six-month return frequency. Wetpool facilities are sized based upon the volume of runoff predicted through use of the Natural Resource Conservation Service curve number equations in Chapter 2 of Volume III of the Manual, for the six-month, 24-hour storm. Alternatively, when using an approved continuous runoff model, the water quality design storm volume shall be equal to the simulated daily volume that represents the upper limit of the range of daily volumes that accounts for 91 percent of the entire runoff volume over a multi-decade period of record.

(ii) Water quality design flow rate:

The flow rate shall be the flow rate at or below which 91 percent of the runoff volume, as estimated by an approved continuous runoff model, will be treated. Design criteria for treatment facilities are assigned to achieve the applicable performance goal (e.g., 80 percent TSS removal) at the water quality design flow rate. At a minimum, 91 percent of the total runoff volume, as estimated by an approved continuous runoff model, must pass through the treatment facility(ies) at or below the approved hydraulic loading rate for the facility(ies).

(B) Downstream of Detention Facilities. The water quality design flow rate must be the full two-year release rate from the detention facility.

(iii) The director may allow alternative methods if they identify volumes and flow rates that are at least equivalent.

Direct discharge of untreated stormwater from pollution-generating hard surfaces to ground water is prohibited, except for the discharge achieved by infiltration or dispersion of runoff through use of on-site stormwater management BMPs, in accordance with Chapter 5, Volume V and Chapter 7, Volume V (Manual); or by infiltration through soils meeting the soil suitability criteria in Chapter 3 of Volume III (Manual).

(7) Minimum Requirement No. 7 – Flow Control.

(a) Applicability.

(i) Flow Control. Projects must provide flow control to reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff from hard surfaces and land cover conversions. The requirement below applies to projects that discharge stormwater directly, or indirectly through a conveyance system, into a fresh water body.

(ii) Exempt Areas. Flow control is not required for projects that discharge directly to, or indirectly to a water listed in Appendix I-E of the Manual subject to the following restrictions:

(A) The area must be drained by a conveyance system that is comprised entirely of manmade conveyance elements (e.g., pipes, ditches, outfall protection, etc.) and extends to the ordinary high water line of the receiving water; and

(B) Any erodible elements of the manmade conveyance system for the area must be adequately stabilized to prevent erosion; and

(C) Surface water from the area must not be diverted from or increased to an existing wetland, stream, or near-shore habitat sufficient to cause a significant adverse impact.

(D) Direct discharge to the exempt receiving water does not result in the diversion of drainage from any perennial stream classified as Type 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the State of Washington Interim Water Typing System, or Type “S,” “F,” or “Np” in the Permanent Water Typing System, or from any category I, II, or III wetland.

(E) Flow splitting devices or drainage BMPs are applied to route natural runoff volumes from the project site to any downstream Type 5 stream or category IV wetland:

1. Design of flow splitting devices or drainage BMPs will be based on continuous hydrologic modeling analysis. The design will assure that flows delivered to Type 5 stream reaches will approximate, but in no case exceed, durations ranging from 50 percent of the two-year to the 50-year peak flow.

2. Flow splitting devices or drainage BMPs that deliver flow to category IV wetlands will also be designed using continuous hydrologic modeling to preserve pre-project wetland hydrologic conditions unless specifically waived or exempted by regulatory agencies with permitting jurisdiction.

(b) When assessing a project against the following thresholds, only those impervious, hard and pervious surfaces that are subject to this Minimum Requirement shall be considered:

(i) Projects in which the total of effective impervious surfaces is 10,000 square feet or more in a threshold discharge area; or

(ii) Projects that convert three-fourths acres or more of native vegetation to lawn or landscape, or convert two and one-half acres or more of native vegetation to pasture in a threshold discharge area, and from which there is a surface discharge in a natural or manmade conveyance system from the site; or

(iii) Projects that, through a combination of effective hard surfaces and converted vegetation areas, cause a one-tenth cubic foot per second increase in the 100-year flow frequency from a threshold discharge area as estimated using the Western Washington Hydrology Model or other model and one-hour time steps (or a 0.15 cfs increase using 15-minute time steps) authorized by the director.

(iv) The director may require flow control for individual lots due to sensitive areas, historical flooding, or other relevant reasons as deemed necessary by the director.

(c) Standard Requirement.

(i) Peak Flows. Stormwater discharges shall match developed discharge durations to predeveloped durations for the range of predeveloped discharge rates from 50 percent of the two-year peak flow up to the full 50-year peak flow.

(ii) Predeveloped Condition. The predeveloped condition to be matched shall be a forested land cover unless:

(A) Reasonable, historic information is provided that indicates the site was prairie prior to settlement (modeled as “pasture” in the Western Washington Hydrology Model); or

(B) The drainage area of the immediate stream and all subsequent downstream basins have had at least 40 percent total impervious area since 1985. In this case, the predeveloped condition to be matched shall be the existing land cover condition. Appendix I-F in the Manual provides a map which depicts those areas which meet this criterion. Where basin-specific studies determine a stream channel to be unstable, even though the above criterion is met, the predeveloped condition assumption shall be the “historic” land cover condition, or a land cover condition commensurate with achieving a target flow regime identified by an approved basin study.

(iii) This standard requirement is waived for sites that will reliably infiltrate all the runoff from hard surfaces and converted vegetation areas.

(iv) Flow Control Facility Selection, Design, and Maintenance. Flow control facilities shall be selected, designed, and maintained in accordance with Volume III of the Manual.

(8) Minimum Requirement No. 8 – Wetlands Protection.

(a) Applicability. The requirements below apply only to projects whose stormwater discharges into a wetland, either directly or indirectly through a conveyance system.

(b) Thresholds. The thresholds identified in Minimum Requirement No. 6 – Runoff Treatment, and Minimum Requirement No. 7 – Flow Control, shall also be applied to determine the applicability of this requirement for discharges to wetlands.

(c) Standard Requirement. Projects shall comply with Guide Sheets No. 1 through No. 3 in Appendix I-D of the Manual. The hydrologic analysis shall use the existing land cover condition to determine the existing hydrologic conditions unless directed otherwise by the director.

(d) Additional Requirements. The standard requirement does not excuse any discharge from the obligation to apply whatever technology is necessary to comply with state water quality standards, Chapter 173-201A WAC, or state ground water standards, Chapter 173-200 WAC or successor regulations. Stormwater treatment and flow control facilities shall not be built within a natural vegetated buffer, except for: necessary conveyance systems as approved by the director; or as allowed in wetlands approved for hydrologic modification and/or treatment in accordance with the Manual. An adopted and implemented basin plan, or a total maximum daily load (TMDL) may be used to develop requirements for wetlands that are tailored to a specific basin.

(9) Minimum Requirement No. 9 – Operation and Maintenance. An operation and maintenance manual that is consistent with the Manual shall be provided for all proposed stormwater facilities and BMPs, and the party (or parties) responsible for maintenance and operation shall be identified. At private facilities, a copy of the manual shall be retained on site or within reasonable access to the site, and shall be transferred with the property to the new owner. For public facilities, a copy of the manual shall be retained by the director or other appropriate location. A log of maintenance activity that indicates what actions were taken shall be kept and be available for inspection by the director. (Ord. 26-16 § 1, 2016; Ord. 19-14 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 03-10 § 2 (Exh. B), 2010; Ord. 25-95 § 1, 1995.).

The discharges shall be dechlorinated to a concentration of 0.1 ppm or less, pH-adjusted and reoxygenized if necessary, volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent resuspension of sediments in the MS4. Discharges shall be thermally controlled to prevent an increase in temperature of the receiving water. Swimming pool cleaning wastewater and filter backwash shall not be discharged to the MS4.

(d) Street and sidewalk wash water, water used to control dust, and routine external building wash down that does not use detergents. Discharges from these sources shall be minimized through public education activities in accordance with the permit. At active construction sites, street sweeping must be performed prior to washing the street.

(e) Other nonstormwater discharges. The discharges shall be in compliance with the requirements of the stormwater pollution prevention plan reviewed by the city, which addresses control of construction site dewatering discharges.

(f) Solid or liquid wastes thrown, drained or otherwise discharged directly or indirectly into the municipal storm drain system and/or surface and ground waters. Examples of prohibited contaminants include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Trash or debris.

In addition, the city is required to comply with the Western Washington Phase II Municipal Stormwater Permit. The permit requires the city to establish maintenance standards that are as protective, or more protective, of facility function than those specified in Chapter 4 of Volume V of the Manual. (Ord. 26-16 § 2, 2016; Ord. 03-10 § 3 (Exh. C), 2010; Ord. 26-95 § 1, 1995).


14.40.013 Purpose.

The city council adopts the purposes set forth in the model stormwater maintenance ordinance provided by the Department of Ecology that the provisions of this chapter are intended to:

(1) Provide for inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities in Buckley to provide for an effective, functional stormwater drainage system;

(2) Authorize the public works department to require that stormwater facilities be operated, maintained and repaired in conformance with this chapter;

(3) Establish the minimum level of compliance which must be met;

(4) Guide and advise all who conduct inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities. (Ord. 26-16 § 2, 2016; Ord. 03-10 § 3 (Exh. C), 2010; Ord. 26-95 § 1, 1995).


14.40.020 Definitions.

16.12.090    Enforcement, violations and penalties.


16.12.000 Purpose.

The city will promote the health, safety and welfare of its citizens by ensuring that fences do not obscure the sight distance at intersections and are not harmful to its citizens or the wider community. The city further intends to allow the use of fences for screening, privacy, protection of property, small children and retention of pets. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.010 Definition of fence.

For purposes of this chapter, BMC 19.12.225, as now or hereafter amended, shall constitute the definition of a fence. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.020 Measuring height.

The height of a fence located on the ground or a retaining wall shall be the vertical distance from the top board, rail or wire to the ground directly below the fence, except when:

(1) A fence is located on a retaining wall containing fill or a landscaping berm. Here, the height of the retaining wall or berm shall be considered a portion of the height of the fence and shall be measured from the ground on the high side. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.030 Height limits.

In all instances, the height of the fence shall meet the following requirements:

(1) No fence may exceed four feet, zero inches in height within a required front setback.

(2) Fences not within the front yard setback may not exceed the following:

(a) Residential, general and agricultural zones and uses: six feet, zero inches.

(b) Commercial, industrial, business park, utility and public zones and uses: eight feet, zero inches, subject to building code and/or landscaping requirements.

(c) The proposed fence is necessary to afford reasonable privacy, security, screening or noise attenuation to the subject property; and

(d) The proposed fence is not out of character with development in the immediate vicinity of the subject property; and

(e) Because of unusual conditions applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location, natural features or surroundings, which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of the four-foot height would deprive the property of rights and privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.040 Fence location.

(1) Private Property. All fences must be placed on or within the property lines except those fences extending beyond the property lines which are permitted under subsection (2) of this section.

The building official may allow minor encroachments of two to three feet into the public right-of-way in those situations where the property line abuts a public sidewalk and it meets the following conditions:

(a) The proposed fence location will not cause or contribute to a hazardous traffic situation or result in an impediment to the pedestrian way. ADA standards of 48-inch clearance must be maintained between the installed fence and edge of sidewalk or curb face; and

(b) The proposed fence does not restrict access to installed utilities; and

(c) The proposed fence location is not out of character with development in the immediate vicinity of the subject property.

(3) Fences must not obscure the sight distance necessary to allow vehicles to be seen at intersections and on corner lots. (For information about protecting the necessary sight distance, refer to Section 4.12 of the latest version of the Development Guidelines and Public Works Standards or contact the planning department for more information.)

(4) Where landscaping is required pursuant to Chapter 19.29 BMC, fences must be placed behind barrier buffers and visual relief buffers in a fashion to complement and not overwhelm their purpose. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.050 Electric fences.

(1) Permitted Locations.

(a) Electric fences are permitted only on agricultural property or at other locations required by state or federal law.

(b) Exempt from this regulation are those fences intended solely to restrict household domestic pets such as cats and dogs (“invisible fencing”), and not posing a threat to the health and safety of other people and pets walking in proximity of the fence.

(2) Use of Electric Fences.

(a) All electric fences and appliances, equipment, and materials used in connection therewith shall be listed or labeled by a qualified testing agency.

(b) Electric fences shall be installed in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications and in compliance with the latest edition of the National Electrical Code.

(c) Electrical fences located along property lines or adjacent to public rights-of-way, residential zones, and public facilities must be located at a distance and in such a manner as to prohibit incidental contact.

(d) Electric fences shall be posted with permanent nonmetallic signs which are a minimum of 32 square inches in area at intervals of 25 feet along the fence stating that the fence is electrified. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).

(1) Barbed wire may be used on top of a six-foot wire, solid or chain link fence surrounding a public utility, government facility or industrial site;

(2) Barbed wire may be used when the fence is not a property boundary line fence. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.070 Variances.

Any variance from the above requirements beyond that which the building official has express authority to grant shall be obtained in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 19.40 BMC. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).


16.12.080 Regulatory provisions for continuation.

The following regulations shall govern the continuation of nonconforming fences:

(1) Any nonconforming fence as to the terms and conditions as defined in this chapter, which lawfully existed at the time of the final passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, is permitted to continue and to be maintained.

(2) A nonconforming fence may be substantially altered, renovated, enlarged or reconstructed only through the granting of a variance as provided in this title.

(3) Regular and ordinary maintenance shall not be construed as enlargement, expansion, change, alteration, renovation or reconstruction as used in this section.

(4) A nonconforming fence which has been destroyed or removed shall not be replaced or reconstructed unless it complies with this chapter. However, a nonconforming fence which has been partially damaged due to an act of God or other act not perpetrated intentionally by the property owner is exempt from this requirement. (Ord. 08-09 § 1, 2009).

(2) Further Divisions. Land in short subdivisions may not be further divided in any manner within a period of five years without the filing of a final plat, except that when the short plat contains six or fewer parcels, nothing in this section shall prevent the owner who filed the short plat from filing an alteration within the five-year period to create up to a total of six lots within the original short plat boundaries. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).


18.26.020 Filing procedure and fee.

(1) The number of copies prescribed by the planning department of a proposed short plat shall be filed with the city.

(2) The application fee, with related anticipated costs in the form of a deposit as specified in an adopted city resolution, shall be paid to the city at the same time the proposed short plat application is filed therewith.

(3) At the time the application for short plat is submitted to the city, the applicant shall also submit proof of date of segregation, showing the date that the total parcel, as it is now legally described, was originally created;

(4) Additional preliminary short plat procedures shall follow the required review, notice and approval processes specified in BMC Title 20. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).

18.26.040 Review criteria.

(1) In compliance with review criteria listed in RCW 58.17.110, reflected in BMC 18.22.010, the review authority shall inquire into the public use and interest proposed to be served by establishment of the proposed short plat, and shall determine if appropriate provisions are made for, but not limited to:

(a) Public health, safety, and general welfare;

(b) Open spaces;

(c) Drainage ways;

(d) Streets or roads, alleys, other public ways;

(e) Transit stops;

(f) Potable water supplies;

(g) Sanitary wastes;

(h) Parks and recreation;

(l) Whether the public use and interest will be served by the platting of such short subdivision and dedication.

All of these listed short plat review criteria are required to be considered for preliminary short plat approval. Additional review criteria most applicable to short plats are described further below:

(2) Access.

(a) The proposed short plat may be reviewed for adequate ingress and egress to all proposed lots. Extension of roads or access rights from property line to property line of the short plat subdivision land may be required so that the road may be extended in the future, as consistent with constitutional requirements and the planned and/or anticipated transportation needs of the city. If there is other reasonable access available, the city engineer may limit the location of direct access to city arterials or other city roads. When an adjoining landowner will be obligated to construct or maintain a future road connection, a note to this effect shall be stated on the face of the short plat.

(b) Road Reserved Areas. Where a city collector or arterial street is proposed as per adopted plan, the planning director or city engineer shall require the adopted right-of-way area section to be reserved as a street for future development, unless the city engineer makes written findings that unique circumstances and undue hardship justify a narrower width.

(c) Private Streets. Unless the city has adopted plans for a city collector or arterial street on or adjacent to the properties in issue, the city engineer may approve a private street, if all persons and their successors who own the land adjoining the private street within the short plat and adjacent properties have equal legal rights to use the private street. The developer shall bear the expense of constructing the private street. Where the short plat or land beyond the short plat has the potential of being further subdivided, then the private street shall be required to have a right-of-way width equivalent to city standards as per the adopted street plan.

(d) All owners of property taking access from the private street shall share equally in the maintenance of the private street.

(e) Private streets shall only be permitted to be constructed in short plats or to serve unplatted lots of record.

(3) Drainage. The proposed short plat shall be reviewed for existing and proposed drainage facilities.

(4) Sewers or Septic Tanks. The proposed short plat shall be reviewed for provision of sanitary sewage facilities serving the development per adopted sanitary sewage requirements. If known local conditions exist which may affect future building sites, these conditions shall be stated on the face of the short plat.

(5) Feasibility for Building Sites. All critical areas, setbacks, and any building restrictions that affect the feasibility of the building site shall be noted on the face of the short plat.

(6) Water Supply and Fire Protection. The proposed short plat shall be reviewed for potential adequacy of water supply and fire protection and necessary fire flow and required fire hydrant(s) shall be installed as required by the fire chief or his/her designee.

(7) Denial of Short Plat. Failure to comply with subsections (14), (15) or (17) of this section shall be criteria for which a short plat can be denied. Existing city standards shall be used during the review process. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).


18.26.050 Preliminary approval.

(1) Review. The city shall complete its review and issue either preliminary approval or disapproval of the proposed short plat or short subdivision, or return the application for modification or correction according to review timelines specified in BMC Title 20, unless an environmental analysis is required as stated in this chapter. Upon receipt of a short plat in proper form by the city, the planning director shall forward one copy of the application to the public works director, the city engineer, fire chief and other departments and agencies, who shall review and make recommendations on the proposed plat.

A proposed short plat shall not be approved unless the planning director issues a notice of decision to the applicant which contains the following written findings:

(a) Appropriate provisions are made for the public health, safety, convenience, quality of life and general welfare, in accordance with city of Buckley codes and standards.

(b) The public use and interest will be served by the platting of such subdivision.

(2) Improvements Required. The city engineer shall provide minimum installation standards in regard to materials, design and construction. Said standards shall be appropriate to the locality, topography, soil conditions and geology of the area in which the proposed subdivision is to be developed and improved and shall be basic requirements to be met by all developers. Said standards shall be made available to all developers, and their surveyors and engineers. All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the city of Buckley development guidelines and public works standards. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).


18.26.060 Final approval.

(1) The final short plat shall receive final approval according to the review process, decision authority, and timelines specified in BMC Title 20, after all required improvements have been constructed and the construction approved by the city engineer, or after the owner or developer of the short plat has entered into a contract and posted a 150 percent performance bond with the city guaranteeing that all required construction of improvements will be completed within one year. For final approval the short plat shall be submitted in a format prescribed by the planning department and then recorded with the county auditor upon approval.

(2) A complete final short plat application shall be submitted to the planning department within five years after preliminary approval. The planning director may extend the time for submission of a final short plat up to an additional 24 months for good cause shown. If no final plat is filed within five years or no extension given, the preliminary approval shall lapse.

(3) For short plats preliminarily approved but not finalized prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, the expiration date shall be five years from the date that notice is mailed to the property owner.

(4) Short plats shall be approved, disapproved, or returned to the applicant within 30 days from the date of filing of final plat, unless the applicant consents to an extension of such time period. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).


18.26.070 Public utility service.

No public utility service will be provided to any buildings or improvements constructed within a short plat until the construction of all required improvements has been completed and approved by the city engineer or unless the requirements set out in BMC 18.26.060 have met with compliance. These public utility services shall include water supply, sanitary sewer service, and natural gas. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).


18.26.080 Revisions to short subdivisions.

Minor revisions to short subdivisions may be approved by the planning director if they do not qualify as lot line adjustments, do not create any additional lots, do not alter a dedication and do not alter or increase adverse impacts on adjoining properties and are consistent with the public interest and the comprehensive plan. All alterations and vacations involving increased impacts or dedications shall be subject to RCW 58.17.212 and 58.17.215, as now or hereafter amended. All minor revisions shall be recorded with the county auditor as an amendment to the short subdivision. (Ord. 09-20 § 1, 2020).

The request for lot combination or boundary line adjustment shall be accompanied by and shall contain the following:

(1) The completed application and fee per adopted city resolution;

(2) A scale drawing of the affected lots, including the dimensions of the lot before and after the proposed lot combination or boundary line adjustment, and a plot plan as appropriate showing the location and dimensions of existing structure(s) in relation to the proposed lot/boundary line adjustment as prepared by a professional land surveyor;

19.06.010 Purpose.

This chapter provides for a unified process for amending the city of Buckley’s comprehensive plan (“comprehensive plan”) on an annual basis as required by law. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.06.020 Comprehensive plan – Annual amendment – Exceptions.

(1) The comprehensive plan of the city of Buckley is the current or any future plan adopted pursuant to Chapter 36.70A RCW (the “Growth Management Act”). The comprehensive plan includes all subsequent annual amendments.

(2) Proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan shall be processed pursuant to this chapter and BMC Title 20.

(3) RCW 36.70A.130 allows annual amendment(s) of the comprehensive plan; except that amendments to the comprehensive plan may be considered more frequently to address the following:

(a) Resolution of an emergency condition or a situation that involves public health, safety or welfare; and when adherence to the annual amendment process would be further detrimental to public health, safety or welfare;

(b) Initial adoption of an identified subarea plan designed to comply with the Growth Management Act and to be consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan;

(c) An appeal of the plan filed with the Growth Management Hearings Board or with the court;

(d) The adoption or amendment of a shoreline master program under Chapter 90.58 RCW;

19.22.010 General applicability.

Each zone code shall be subject to the general provisions, conditions, and exceptions contained in this chapter except where a specific provision of the zoning code applicable to said zone shall prevail. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 5, 1981. Formerly 19.24.010). 


19.22.020 Yards and open spaces. 

Except as provided in this chapter, every required yard and open space shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky. No yard or open space provided around any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this title shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building and no yard or open space on any lot or parcel shall be considered as providing a yard or open space on an adjoining lot or parcel whereon a building is to be erected; provided, however, shrubs, trees and other vegetation shall be allowed in open space. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 5, 1981. Formerly 19.24.020).


19.22.030 Greater yard and open space requirements include minimum requirements.

Wherever in this title a particular use, or a building in connection with a particular use, is specifically required to observe a distance from any boundary property line or other building or buildings on the site greater than the minimum standard required yard or open space set forth for the zone, such greater distance is intended to apply only to the particular building, buildings or use involved and the standard required minimum yards and open spaces required for the zone, if any, shall be included as a part of the greater required distance or open space for the specific building, buildings or use. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 5, 1981. Formerly 19.24.030).


19.22.040 Use limitations on corner lots.

On every corner lot within the triangle formed by the street lines of such lot and a line drawn between points on such lines which are 30 feet from the intersection thereof, there shall be no structure or planting of such nature and dimension as to obstruct lateral vision other than a post, column, or trunk of a tree (but no branches or foliage) which is of greater than one foot in cross-section or diameter. Such lateral vision shall be maintained between two horizontal planes, one of which is two and one-half feet, and the other which is 10 feet above the centerline grade of existing streets.

Since the purpose of this provision is to promote public safety by preserving reasonable sight distance for vehicular traffic at street intersections, the superintendent of public works may vary the specific requirements in those circumstances where structures of plantings between the two horizontal planes do not in fact interfere with sight distances. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 5, 1981. Formerly 19.24.040).

(2) Uncovered porches, platforms and decks that are less than 30 inches above grade may intrude no closer than five feet to the side lot line and six feet into the front lot setback area;

(3) Planting boxes or masonry planters not exceeding 42 inches in height may extend into any required front yard;

(4) Roof overhangs, eaves, dormers, windows, window casings, rain gutters and down spouts and other unoccupied fixtures or portions of buildings: 30-inch projection;

(5) Existing outbuildings which are legally nonconforming solely by reason of their intrusion into the required yard setback may be relocated and/or reconstructed within the same yard only in accordance with the following criteria:

(a) The affected substandard setback area is not further reduced in size;

(b) The floor area of the outbuilding located within the substandard yard is not increased;

(c) Relocation occurs only within the same yard and does not result in nonconformity with regard to another required yard or zoning standard; and

(d) That the relocation or reconstruction would not substantially hinder or impair any other stated goal of the zoning code. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 17-94 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3-89 § 1, 1989; Ord. 1-88 § 1, 1988; Ord. 1020 § 5, 1981. Formerly 19.24.050).

19.23.010 Purpose.

A residential cluster is intended to be a flexible concept established to:

(1) Provide the city a chance to implement the comprehensive plan by molding a zone so that it creates more desirable environments; and

(2) Provide for better uses of the land than those produced through the narrower standards provided in the regular zoning classifications; and

(3) Give developers the ability to build at higher densities while providing increased respect for natural features; and

(4) Offer greater protection and buffering to environmentally sensitive areas and desired open spaces.

The densities within a residential cluster may vary depending upon how the land is developed. Flexibility to decrease lot sizes in one part of the plan depends upon the overall plan’s consideration of aesthetics, alternative design features, protection of sensitive areas, and provision of open space and preservation of natural features. The total overall density shall be the same density permitted in the underlying zone. (Ord. 01-12 § 13, 2012; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.020 Initiation of a residential cluster.

An application for a residential cluster may be initiated by the property owner(s) or contract purchaser(s) of property involved in a proposed residential cluster. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.030 Permitted location for residential cluster.

Residential clusters shall only be permitted in the R-6,000, R-8,000, and R-20,000 residential zones. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.040 Minimum area required.

Minimum area required for a residential cluster is not less than five acres. The city council, in order to protect the public health, safety, welfare and interest, may limit or restrict development in the area proposed to be clustered, or portion thereof, in relation to the size of the area being developed or redeveloped, provisions for open space, and adequacy of roads and utility systems to accommodate the use as well as to minimize the impact the development will have on the existing or intended development on adjacent lands and the general neighborhood. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.050 Minimum area per residential lot created.

Except as otherwise noted in this chapter, the minimum area for any residential lot created through residential clustering shall be 4,500 square feet in the R-6,000 zone, 6,000 square feet in the R-8,000 zone and 12,500 in the R-20,000 zone. Lots developed at the minimum allowed area shall be subject to the performance standards and dimensional requirements as delineated in the R-6,000 zone, except as otherwise noted in this chapter. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.055 Reduced required side setbacks in R-6,000 and R-8,000 zones.

The minimum side setbacks in a residential cluster shall be reduced for those lots developed at the minimum lot area (as allowed by BMC 19.23.050) in the R-6,000 and R-8,000 zones to seven feet on each side. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.060 Variety of lot sizes.

Based on the flexible concept of the residential cluster, lot sizes within any proposed project developed under this concept shall offer a mix of lot sizes. A maximum of 40 percent of the total lots allowed per acre of the overall density of the zone in which located shall be allowed at the minimum lot size specified within BMC 19.23.050. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.070 Open space set aside.

A minimum of 10 percent of the gross area of land to be developed under the residential cluster designation must be set aside as open space, 50 percent of which shall be active open space adequate for such uses as playgrounds, sports fields, ball courts, pedestrian/bicycling trails, courtyards, orchards, landscaped picnic areas, gardens, etc. Additionally, the dedicated open space must correspond to deficiencies, needs and/or improvements identified within the adopted city of Buckley parks and recreation plan as administered by the planning director. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.080 Design criteria.

Any application for development under the residential cluster concept shall be required to incorporate the following design features:

(1) Diversified Streetscape. Diversified streetscapes and sidewalkscapes will prohibit building on a linear plane. The applicant shall implement a combination of design options to create a diversified streetscape including but not limited to:

(a) Facade modulation.

(b) Alternating setbacks.

(c) Alternating features (porch, stoop, shutters).

(d) Alternating rooflines/pitch.

(e) Meandering sidewalks.

(f) Use of traffic calming devices (subsection (6) of this section).

(g) Similar provisions not listed that the planning director finds implement the intent consistent with those that are listed.

Though patterns may meander, efforts shall be made to maintain the grid pattern to produce connectivity to adjacent developments.

(2) Connection to/Improvement of Safe Routes Plan and Trail Plan.

(a) Where the development is within an area designated on the adopted trail plan map it must coordinate with the city to incorporate the trail plan into the overall site plan.

(b) Sidewalks and trails within the development shall connect to and subsequently be incorporated into the city of Buckley’s trail system.

(c) Trails shall connect all open spaces and public nodes of interest.

(d) Efforts shall be made to place trails in areas so as to promote their safe use and visibility.

(3) Frontages.

(a) The front door and main entrance to every residential building shall face the street or, in the alternative, common open space if the unit does not abut a public right-of-way (not including alleys).

(b) Twenty-five percent of all residential buildings in zones R-6,000 and R-8,000 shall have their front entrance articulated with a covered entry porch, covered stoop, or other similar feature integrated with the design of a home (stoops may not constitute more than five percent of this requirement). Porches and stoops shall constitute usable areas, with suggested minimum dimensions of six-foot depth and 12-foot width (porch) and six-foot by six-foot (stoop). Porches may wrap around front corners to the side of buildings, and should vary in size and type.

(4) Diversity of Housing Types.

(a) For R-6,000 and R-8,000 zones:

(i) Ten percent of all lots shall not be developed as detached single-family housing units. This allows the development of duplexes and townhouses. These units shall be designed to complement the project’s single-family houses and to be integrated into the development and single-family setting. When placed on a corner, units shall be constructed to afford at least one unit oriented to each of the adjacent streets, where feasible. 

(ii) A minimum of 15 percent of all lots shall be developed as one-story buildings. These units shall be located in an effort to protect view corridors. 

(5) Diversity of Housing Plans. Single-family dwellings shall vary, and in so doing provide a range of compatible styles, elevations, designs, home sizes, home prices, and neighborhood diversity, specifically:

(a) A repetitive architectural treatment and/or elevations for a group of single-family homes shall be avoided.

(b) Differing footprints, sizes, elevations, colors, surface materials, entryway treatments, window designs, roof configurations, and other features shall be utilized to achieve building variety.

(c) Dwellings using identical elevation plans and details shall be separated by at least four single-family homes with different elevations. Identical elevations may not be across the street from one another.

(d) Builders are encouraged to produce model homes that offer variation as indicated by the previous standards.

(e) Building design and layout shall minimize the impacts on natural features of the site where possible. Open space and setback requirements should be used to break up impervious surface where possible.

(f) A minimum of 15 percent of the total window area permitted by the Washington State Energy Code shall be provided in building facades facing streets. 

(6) Traditional Neighborhood Design and Development Pattern.

(a) Streets should be laid out in the traditional grid pattern with connections to existing city thoroughfares at right angles.

(b) Cul-de-sacs should be avoided. They may only be placed where it can be demonstrated that traditional complete connection to the grid pattern is not logical.

(c) Access streets should consider the utilization of traffic calming devices so as to ensure safety of residents and other pedestrians. Examples of traffic calming measures may include one or more of the following:

(i) Planting islands/medians.

(ii) Chicanes.

(iii) Textured pavements.

(iv) Raised crosswalks.

(v) Raised intersections.

(vi) Traffic circles.

(vii) Others as approved by the city engineer and planning director.

(d) In all blocks where 40 percent or more of the building lots are of the minimum lot size, alleyways shall be provided in the block in which located. 

(7) View Corridors. The locations of many properties in Buckley afford views of Mount Rainier and the Cascade Mountains. Buildings should be arranged so as to protect the view corridors of existing property owners through:

(a) Careful placement of large trees and landscaping structures so as to maintain view corridors; and

(b) Careful placement of two-story homes so as to maintain view corridors; and

(c) Particular attention should be given to protection of the view corridor within the open space set-aside areas. (Ord. 15-17 § 5, 2017; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.085 Design criteria density bonuses.

In keeping with the city’s comprehensive plan goal of allowing for density bonuses for excellence in design, the applicant may obtain additional density for environmental, low impact development, affordable and view protection design by incorporating the following alternatives; provided, that by incorporating all three alternatives into a lot and building design the minimum lot area and dimension will be eligible for a 10 percent lot area and dimension reduction for that lot. For example: by constructing a single-family ranch style home in the R-6,000 zone, 18 feet in height, that certifies as “built green” on a lot that has met the SLID option, the minimum lot size may be reduced by 10 percent from 4,500 square feet to 4,050 square feet, the 45-foot minimum lot width reduced to 40 feet, and the lot area coverage increased from 35 percent to 45 percent. 

(1) Green Building. Where a developer can demonstrate that a building certifies as “built green” under the Washington State Master Builders Association, and that green building techniques will be used to significantly reduce the ecological footprint of any individual lot, that lot size may be reduced by an additional four percent.

(a) Findings Required. Green building will be considered eligible for the four percent lot size reduction if the developer can demonstrate that their plans and techniques qualify as a “built green” building under the Washington State Master Builders Association Certification. This determination of eligibility is subject to the findings of the planning director.

(b) Bond. The developer shall be required to post a bond of 150 percent of the assessed value of the lot in question to assure compliance with proposed green building plans. 

(2) Stormwater Runoff.

(a) Stormwater runoff shall be per compliance with Chapter 14.30 BMC.

(b) Sustainable Low Impact Development (SLID) Option. Residential clusters may apply at least two of the following stormwater runoff mitigation techniques in addition to maintaining existing vegetation as possible:

(i) Raingardens. Provision of a raingarden on each lot where possible or on site at a common location.

(ii) Permeable/porous parking lanes, alleys, driveways, sidewalks, paved patios, and decks. 

(iii) Grass-lined and landscaped swales.

(iv) Natural drainage corridors and ponds.

(c) If using the SLID option, the minimum size of that lot size may be reduced by an additional four percent.

(d) Any SLID measures implemented shall be required to be included within a stormwater maintenance agreement for the development to ensure continuous long-term maintenance. 

(3) Single-family ramblers/ranch style designs not exceeding 20 feet in height are permitted at higher lot area coverage on the smallest of allowed lot sizes; provided the setback yard requirements of BMC 19.23.055 are met. This design exception is allowed an increase of up to 10 percent of allowable lot area coverage (based on the underlying zone). (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.090 Procedure for approval.

Applications for a residential cluster will be processed as a Type C-2 application, as described in BMC Title 20. (Ord. 13-19 § 3, 2019; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.100 Residential cluster – Findings required.

The action by the city council to approve a preliminary development plan for a proposed residential cluster with or without modifications shall be based upon the following findings:

(1) That the proposed development is in substantial compliance with the Buckley comprehensive plan;

(2) That exceptions from the standards of the underlying zone are warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan and program;

(3) That the proposal is in harmony with the surrounding area;

(4) If applicable, that the system of ownership and means of developing, preserving, and maintaining the open space or natural area is suitable;

(5) That adequate roads and utility systems are available to accommodate the use. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.110 Subdivisions.

When it is the intent of an applicant to subdivide or resubdivide property within a proposed residential cluster, application for approval of a preliminary subdivision may be filed and considered concurrently. In such event, the procedure for review of subdivisions provided under Chapter 18.22 BMC will apply, with the additional requirement for submittal of a final development plan, described in BMC 19.23.120 and 19.23.130, prior to or with the final plat. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.120 Final development plan – Time limitation.

Within three years from the date of preliminary plat approval by the city council, the applicant shall submit a final development plan for approval. The final development plan may provide for stages of development for the residential cluster. When deemed reasonable and appropriate, the city council may grant one extension of one year for such submittal.

If at the time of expiration of the time period provided herein a final development plan has not been filed for approval, or at any time after a final plan has been approved it appears that the project is not progressing in a reasonable and consistent manner or the project has been abandoned, action may be initiated pursuant to the Buckley Municipal Code to revoke the approval. When revocation has been enacted, the land and the structures thereon may only be used for a lawful purpose permissible within the zone. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.130 Final development plan – Changes.

Major changes to a final development plan before or after approval shall be considered to be an amendment to the proposed residential cluster and shall be subject to application, notice, hearings and appeals in the same manner as the original application. Minor modifications to a final development plan may be approved by the planning director; provided, that the modifications do not increase density, change boundaries, change any use, and do not change the location or amount of land devoted to specific land uses. A change shall not be considered to be minor if it alters or in any way changes the conditions or specifications set forth by the city council. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.140 Off-street parking.

Refer to Chapter 19.28 BMC. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.150 Yards.

The requirement for yards in a residential cluster shall be the same as required by the underlying zone, except as otherwise permitted in this chapter. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.23.160 Parties bound by the residential cluster.

Once the preliminary plat cluster development plan is approved by the city council, all persons and parties, their successors and heirs who own or have any interest in the real property within the proposed residential cluster are bound by the city’s approval. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).

(Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.24.020 Development standards.

CHDs shall be subject to the following development standards:

(1) Cottage Housing Development Size.

(a) CHDs are not permitted on sites less than one acre in size (a site may be composed of more than one contiguous lot).

(b) CHDs shall contain clusters consisting of a minimum of four dwelling units and a maximum of 12 units, unless otherwise permitted by this chapter. 

(c) A CHD may be integrated into a larger conventional subdivision as long as the grid pattern is maintained. 

(2) Locational Criteria. A CHD in any zone shall be separated from another CHD by a minimum of 300 feet measured between the closest points of the subject properties. This provision may be waived or modified in a residential cluster. 

(3) Calculation of Cottage and Carriage Units.

(a) The following steps shall be utilized in the R-6,000 and R-8,000 zones to determine the number of units permitted on a given site:

(i) The applicant shall submit a pro forma site plan showing the number of conventional dwelling units that would be permitted by the underlying zoning classification.

(ii) The number calculated in subsection (3)(a)(i) of this section shall be multiplied by one and six-tenths. Fractional numbers of one-half or greater shall be rounded up. Fractional numbers less than one-half shall be rounded down. The resulting number is the number of dwelling units permitted on the site, subject to the maximum identified in subsection (1)(b) of this section. 

(b) In the HDR zone one dwelling unit is permitted for each 2,500 square feet of lot area, based on gross lot size.

(4) Unit Size.

(a) Cottage unit floor area shall be between 800 and 1,200 square feet.

(b) Carriage unit living space floor area shall be between 800 and 950 square feet. 

(c) Floor area is the area within the surrounding exterior walls, but excluding space where the floor to ceiling height is less than six feet. Floor area does not include covered porches. The planning director shall use appropriate discretion, consistent with the intent of this chapter, in determining area to be counted in the calculation of maximum square footage.

(5) Private Open Space. Each dwelling unit shall provide a minimum of 400 square feet of private front yard space. Examples include lawn area, courtyards and patios. No dimension of a private open space area used to satisfy the minimum square footage requirement shall be less than nine feet. 

(6) Common Open Space.

(a) A minimum of 250 square feet of common open space shall be provided per dwelling unit.

(b) Common open space within a CHD shall be a minimum of 3,000 square feet in size, regardless of number of dwelling units.

(e) Required common open space shall be divided into no more than two separate areas per cluster of dwelling units.

(f) Common open space shall be improved for passive or active recreational use. Examples may include but are not limited to courtyards, orchards, landscaped picnic areas or gardens. Common open space shall include amenities such as seating, landscaping, trails, gazebos, barbecue facilities, covered shelters or water features. Surface water management facilities that provide LID techniques and enhance the overall quality of the space may be located in common open space areas, upon review and acceptance by the planning director.

(7) Site Design.

(a) At least 75 percent of the units shall abut common open space. 

(b) CHDs should be designed to fit seamlessly into a block on the grid pattern. The only allowed modification of the grid system is a 90-degree rotation of the alleyways to allow for vehicular access to the carriage units.

(c) Common open spaces shall have dwelling units abutting at least two sides.

Siting of dwelling units or common open space in areas with slopes exceeding 15 percent is not encouraged. Dwelling units shall not be placed in such areas if extensive use of retaining walls is necessary to create building pads, or open space areas. 

(d) All carriage units must be alley-loaded and screened from view from other public right-of-ways. 

(e) Common open space areas may not include lands that are designated as sensitive areas.

(8) Design Standards.

(a) Dwelling units shall have a minimum 4:12 roof pitch. Portions of a roof with a pitch less than 4:12 shall be limited to architectural features such as dormers, porch roofs and shed roofs.

(b) Each dwelling unit abutting a public right-of-way (not including alleys) shall have a primary entry and covered porch a minimum of 72 square feet in size, oriented towards the public right-of-way. If abutting more than one public right-of-way, the applicant, with city input, shall determine which right-of-way the entrance and covered porch shall be oriented towards.

(c) Each dwelling unit abutting a public right-of-way (not including alleys) shall be a single-story dwelling unit.

(h) Parking in the form of garages, carports or surface lots may occupy no more than 40 percent of site frontage on a public right-of-way, except in the case of an alley, in which case no restriction applies. 

(i) Surface parking lots shall be set back 15 feet from front property lines and 10 feet from external side and rear property lines.

(j) Surface parking lots of more than two spaces, visible from a public right-of-way (not including alleys) or adjacent single-family uses or zones, shall be screened by landscaping and/or architectural features.

(10) Height. Cottage units shall not exceed 18 feet in height. Carriage units shall not exceed 26 feet in height. 

(11) Setbacks and Building Separation.

(a) Nondwelling structures shall have a minimum setback from the public street of 10 feet. 

(b) Structures within the CHD shall have a minimum separation of 10 feet from each other. Where more than one detached dwelling unit is located on an individual lot the detached dwelling units must maintain a minimum of 14 feet setback from one another. 

(c) Structures shall be set back from their property lines on all sides a minimum of seven feet. 

(12) Lot Coverage. Lot coverage in CHDs shall not exceed 60 percent of gross site area. Lot coverage shall be calculated for the overall CHD, not for individual lots.

(13) Common Area Maintenance. CHDs shall be required to implement a mechanism, acceptable to the planning director, to ensure the continued care and maintenance of CHD common areas. A typical example would be creation of a homeowners’ association with authority and funding necessary to maintain the common areas.

(14) General Provisions.

(a) CHDs in the R-6,000 and R-8,000 zones are permitted as subdivisions, short subdivisions, and cluster or townhome developments. CHDs in the HDR zone are permitted as subdivisions, short subdivisions, townhome developments or multifamily developments.

19.25.040 Policy statement.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: (1) enhance the ability of personal wireless service providers to provide such services throughout the city quickly, effectively, and efficiently; (2) encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antennas in nonresidential areas; (3) encourage personal wireless service providers to collocate on new and existing tower sites; (4) encourage personal wireless service providers to locate towers and antennas, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on city residents is minimal; and (5) encourage personal wireless service providers to configure towers and antennas in a way that minimizes any significant adverse visual impact.

All new antennas shall comply with this chapter after the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter. All towers and antennas legally existing but not in compliance with these regulations as of the effective date of said ordinance shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist, but will be considered nonconforming uses. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on existing towers and antennas. However, new construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers, antennas, buildings or other facilities shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 5, 1999. Formerly 19.25.030).


19.25.050 Site selection criteria.

(1) Any applicant proposing to construct an antenna support structure, or mount an antenna on an existing structure, shall demonstrate by engineering evidence that the antenna must be located at the site to satisfy its function in the applicant’s local network. 

(2) Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates that it is FCC-licensed.

(3) In all zones where permitted, location and design of facilities shall consider the impacts of the facility on the surrounding neighborhood.

(4) Personal wireless service facilities are prohibited in all residential zones and within the historic-commercial design review district, as such district is described in BMC 19.50.060. 

(5) Personal wireless service facilities shall not be located to block any existing and future view of Mt. Rainier from any residential zone or residential use in a mixed zone. 

(6) Personal wireless service facilities are allowed in the HC zone only if fully camouflaged with no antenna apparent. Use in the HC zone shall coordinate with existing historic buildings and design, as determined by the design committee. (Ord. 01-13 § 11, 2013; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 6, 1999. Formerly 19.25.040).


19.25.060 Priority of locations.

The applicant shall be required to demonstrate that it is not feasible to utilize property in a higher priority than what is proposed. The order of priorities for locating new personal wireless service facilities shall be as follows:

(1) Place new fully camouflaged towers and antenna on public zoned properties on the north side of the city. For purposes of this subsection, “north” is understood to be north of a line generally drawn east-west along Fourth Avenue from Naches Street to McNeely Street, and then generally north of Collins Road to Levesque. Placement in this area does not include any area that would affect views of Mt. Rainier from residentially zoned property.

(2) Collocate facilities on existing structures and towers, or place new fully camouflaged towers on park lands adjacent to SR 410.



(3) Collocate telecommunication facilities on existing power poles, flag poles, buildings, within vegetation, or structures on or in public rights-of-way.

(4) Place facilities within areas that will not affect views of Mt. Rainier from residential properties. (Ord. 01-13 § 12, 2013; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 7, 1999. Formerly 19.25.050).


19.25.070 Siting requirements.

(1) Location of towers shall not interfere with transmission from an existing tower.

(2) Minimum Requirements. Placement of personal wireless service facilities on city-owned property must comply with the following requirements:

(a) The facilities will not interfere with the purpose for which the city-owned property is intended;

(b) The facilities will have no significant adverse environmental impacts on surrounding private property;

(c) The applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and commit to a lease agreement that includes equitable compensation for the use of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. The city shall establish fees after considering comparable rates in other cities, potential expenses, risks to the city, and other appropriate factors;

(d) The applicant shall submit a performance bond, or other security acceptable to the city, to cover the costs of removing the facilities;

(e) The lease shall provide that the applicant must agree that in the case of a declared emergency, the city may require the applicant to remove the facilities at the applicant’s expense;

(f) The applicant shall reimburse the city for any reasonable costs which the city incurs because of the presence of the applicant’s facilities;

(g) The applicant shall obtain all necessary land use approvals; and

(h) The applicant shall cooperate with the city’s objective to encourage collocations and thus limit the number of cell sites requested, or camouflage the site.

(3) Special Requirements for Parks. The use of city-owned parks for personal wireless service facilities brings with it special concerns due to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of personal wireless service facilities in a park will be allowed only when the following additional requirements are met:

(a) In no case shall personal wireless service facilities be allowed in designated environmentally sensitive areas (except aquifer recharge areas) unless they are collocated on existing facilities;

(b) Before personal wireless service facilities may be located in public parks, consideration shall be given to visual impacts and disruption of normal public use. 

(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the city to enter into a lease with any applicant and nothing shall be construed as restricting the city from requiring additional lease terms. (Ord. 01-13 § 13, 2013; Ord. 01-12 § 14, 2012; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 8, 1999. Formerly 19.25.060).

(7) A signed statement indicating that the applicant and/or landlord agrees to remove the facility within 180 days after abandonment.

(8) Copies of any environmental documents required by any federal agency. These shall include the environmental assessment required by FCC Part A 1.1307, or, in the event that an FCC environmental assessment is not required, a statement that describes the specific factors that obviate the requirement for an environmental assessment.

(9) A current map and aerial photo showing the location of the proposed antenna support structure; a map showing the locations and service areas of other personal wireless service facilities operated by the applicant and those proposed by the applicant that are close enough to impact service within the city; and documentation describing how the applicant has determined that the proposed site will fit into its overall network within the system.

(10) Legal description of the parcel, if applicable. 

(11) The approximate distance between the proposed personal wireless services facility and the nearest dwelling unit and residential zoned property.

(12) Method of fencing and finished color, and the method of camouflage and illumination. 

(13) A letter signed by the applicant stating the tower will comply with all FAA regulations and EIA standards and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

(14) A statement by the applicant as to whether construction of the tower will accommodate collocation of additional antennas for future users. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 9, 1999. Formerly 19.25.070).


19.25.090 Collocation.

To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, collocation of personal wireless service facilities on existing or new antenna support structures is encouraged as follows:

(1) Proposed new facilities are required to provide for collocation of future users. When existing towers are in the service area needed, collocation onto existing towers is required. Collocation must be accomplished in a manner consistent with the policy, site criteria, and landscape/screening provisions contained in this chapter. While collocation and the requirements herein are encouraged, collocation shall not take precedence over the construction of shorter towers with appropriate screening.

(2) The conditional use permit requirement for a facility may be waived in nonresidential zones if the applicant locates the antenna on a utility pole or an existing tower. Wireless service facilities on new or existing buildings shall require prior approval of a conditional use permit. The applicant must submit detailed plans to the planning and building department to determine if the conditional use permit process and public hearing can be waived. No building permit will be issued until a waiver is granted or a conditional use permit is obtained.

(3) The city may deny an application to construct new facilities if the applicant has not shown by substantial evidence that he/she has made a diligent effort to mount the facilities on an existing structure, building or tower.

(4) Provide documentation that the property owner is willing to lease ground space for another carrier.

(5) No personal wireless service provider or lessee or agent thereof shall fail to cooperate in good faith to accommodate collocation with competitors. If a dispute arises about the feasibility of collocating, the city may require a third party technical study, at the expense of either or both parties, to resolve the dispute. The burden of proof shall remain with the applicant for demonstrating that collocation is not feasible. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 10, 1999. Formerly 19.25.080).


19.25.100 Design criteria.

(1) As provided above, new facilities shall be designed to accommodate collocation, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical, or physical reasons.

(2) Facilities shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses and screened or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site.

(a) Setback. A tower’s setback shall be measured from the closest point of the antenna or antenna support structure to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. 

(i) Uncamouflaged towers shall provide a minimum setback of 50 feet from property boundaries. 

(ii) Fully camouflaged towers shall meet the setbacks for the type of structure the camouflaged tower appears to be in the zone in which it is to be constructed.

(iii) All towers shall provide a safety “fall zone” from inhabited structures or provide sufficient information in the opinion of the city engineer to show that the proposed distance from inhabited structures is adequate. 

(iv) Cabinets and other equipment shall comply with the required setbacks under the zone. 

(v) Greater setbacks may be required if there are unusual geographical limitations, environmental concerns, or other public policy considerations as determined by the decision maker. 

(vi) Cellular equipment on new or existing utility poles shall not be required to meet setback standards.

Such public policy considerations shall include, but are not limited to:

(i) Impact on adjacent properties;

(ii) Availability of alternate sites for personal wireless facilities; or

(iii) The extent to which screening and camouflaging will mitigate the effects of the personal wireless facilities.

(b) Right-of-Way Setback Exception. The setback requirement may be waived if either the antenna and/or antenna support structure are located in the city right-of-way.

(c) View Corridors. Due consideration shall be given so that placement of antenna support structures, antenna, and personal wireless service facilities do not obstruct or significantly diminish views of Mt. Rainier.

(d) Color. Uncamouflaged towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different color is required by the FCC or FAA. For all towers, if the FCC or FAA requires special marking, then the applicant shall request dual mode lighting as an alternate to the marking requirement.

(e) Lights, Signals and Signs. No signals, lights, signs, banners or similar devices shall be permitted on towers or antennas unless provided pursuant to subsection (2)(d) of this section.

(f) Equipment Structures. Ground level equipment, buildings, and the tower base shall be screened from public view. The standards for the equipment structures are as follows:

(i) The maximum floor area is 300 square feet per provider and the maximum height is 12 feet. Depending upon the aesthetics and other criteria as applicable, the city, in its sole discretion, may approve multiple equipment structures or one or more larger structures.

(ii) Ground level structures shall be screened from view by landscape plantings, fencing, or other appropriate means, as specified herein.

(iii) Equipment enclosures mounted on a roof shall be screened or have a finish similar to the exterior building walls. Equipment enclosures for roof-mounted antenna may also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted.

(iv) In instances where equipment structures are located in residential zones, equipment structures shall comply with setback requirements and shall be designed so as to conform in appearance with nearby residential structures.

(g) Federal Requirements. Failure to maintain towers and antennas in compliance with the current federal standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the city to remove a provider’s facilities at the provider’s expense.

(h) Building Codes, Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable city building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), as amended from time to time.

(i) Structural Design. Towers shall be constructed to the EIA standards, which may be amended from time to time, and to all applicable construction/building codes. Further, any improvements or additions to existing towers shall require submission of plans stamped by a professional engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA standards and all other standard industry practices. The plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time building permits are requested.

(j) Fencing. A well-constructed wall or wooden fence not less than six feet in height from the finished grade shall be provided around each personal wireless service facility. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. The use of chain link, plastic, vinyl, or wire fencing is prohibited unless it is fully screened from public view.

(k) Tower and Antenna Height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the tower and antenna are the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. 

(i) No uncamouflaged tower or antenna shall exceed 35 feet in height. 

(ii) Fully camouflaged towers or antennas may be up to 75 feet in height.

(l) Antenna Support Structure Safety. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed antenna and support structure are safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support structure failure or falling objects. All support structures shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.

(m) Required Parking. If the cell site is fully automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the site is not automated, arrangements for adequate off-street parking shall be made and documentation thereof provided to the city, unless it can be demonstrated that the use of on-street parking spaces will create less impact on the immediate neighborhood.

(n) Antennas on Above Ground Structures. An antenna shall be architecturally compatible with the building and wall on which it is mounted, and shall be designed and located so as to minimize any adverse aesthetic impact. A wall-mounted antenna shall be as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not project above the wall on which it is mounted unless it must for technical reasons. In no event shall an antenna project more than six feet above the roof line including parapets. The antenna shall be constructed, painted, or fully screened to match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which it is mounted. The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building, but may not project any higher than the enclosure. The antenna and its support structure shall be designed to withstand a wind force of 90 miles per hour without the use of supporting guy wires except as provided in subsection (2)(o) of this section.

(o) Guy Wires Restricted. No guy or other support wires shall be used except when used to anchor an antenna, antenna array, or support structure to an existing building to which it is attached.

(p) Compliance with FCC Standards. No personal wireless service provider or lessee shall fail to assure that its antenna complies at all times with the current applicable FCC standards. A copy of the current FCC license shall be provided to the city with the application. (Ord. 01-13 § 14, 2013; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 11, 1999. Formerly 19.25.090).


19.25.110 Permits required.

A permit is required for all telecommunication facilities.

(1) A conditional use permit shall be required for the following:

(a) Any structure or telecommunication structure or use provided by technology not addressed in this chapter. 

(b) All fully camouflaged towers taller than 75 feet (e.g., flag pole or tree). 

(2) A variance shall be required for any request that doesn’t comply with the regulations of this code (BMC and this chapter) and for which the use is not prohibited (i.e., listed as prohibited or stated as “shall not”).

(a) Applicants may seek variances to the requirements of this chapter to the extent authorized and consistent with Chapter 19.40 BMC. In the alternative, the hearing body is authorized to waive the requirements of this chapter to the minimum extent necessary to comply with conflicting federal or state regulations. 

(b) The applicant has the burden to establish a conflict with federal and/or state regulations and in so doing is required to demonstrate no feasible alternative design and/or location is available to avoid the conflict.

(c) A conditional use permit is required for any such waiver and the proposed facility as a whole shall be required to meet all requirements for a conditional use permit. 

(3) Failure to comply with any of the regulations of this chapter may result in the revocation of the permit granted for any project. (Ord. 01-13 § 15, 2013; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 12, 1999. Formerly 19.25.100). 


19.25.120 Bonds required.

A landscape maintenance bond equal to 150 percent of the cost of the landscaping and irrigation installation is required for the first two growing seasons following the completion of the project. This bond must be provided prior to final inspection of the project. Bonding requirements shall comply with the city public works standards. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 13, 1999. Formerly 19.25.110).


19.25.130 Reporting requirements.

The city shall be notified within 60 days of any change in ownership of telecommunication facilities or change in any provider that is collocating on the same facilities. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 14, 1999. Formerly 19.25.120).


19.25.140 Landscaping and screening.

(1) Landscaping. Landscaping, as described in this section, shall be required to screen personal wireless service facilities as much as possible to soften the appearance of the cell site. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation should be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual mitigation techniques must be evaluated by the city.

(2) Screening. The visual impacts of a personal wireless service facility shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and structures. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for, or as a supplement to, landscaping requirements. The city may permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping if, in the city’s sole discretion, they achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted flush on an existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required.

The following landscaping and buffering shall be required around the perimeter of the tower and structures, except that the city may waive the standards for those sides of the facility that are not in public view:

(a) A screen of evergreen trees a minimum of six feet tall at planting and a maximum of six feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence.

(b) A continuous hedge at least 36 inches high at planting, capable of growing to at least 72 inches in height within 18 months, shall be planted in front of the tree line referenced above.

(c) In the event that landscaping is not maintained at the required level, the city, after giving 60 days’ advance written notice, may maintain or establish the landscaping and bill both the owner and lessee for such costs.

(3) Irrigation of all landscaped areas may be required in order to ensure that plants become well established and thrive. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 15, 1999. Formerly 19.25.130).


19.25.150 Nonuse and abandonment.

(1) Abandonment. No less than 30 days prior to the date that a personal wireless service provider plans to abandon or discontinue operation of a facility, the provider must notify the city by certified U.S. Mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operation. In the event that a licensed carrier fails to give notice, the facility shall be considered abandoned upon the city’s discovery of discontinuation of operation. Upon such abandonment, the provider shall have 180 days, or additional period of time determined in the reasonable discretion of the city, within which to:

(a) Reactivate the use of the facility or transfer the facility to another provider who makes actual use of the facility (in which case the city shall be notified of the new provider).

(b) A reduction in the height of the antenna array on a tower shall require removal of that portion of the tower which has been abandoned. If another service provider is not added to the tower, then the operator shall promptly dismantle and remove that portion of the tower which exceeds the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes which are made to personal wireless facilities which do not diminish their essential role in providing a total system shall not constitute abandonment.

(c) Dismantle and Remove Facility. If the tower, antenna, foundation, and facility are not removed within 180 days or additional period of time allowed by the city, the city may remove such tower, antenna, foundation, and related facility at the property owner’s expense. If there are two or more providers collocating on a facility, except as provided for in the paragraph above, this provision shall not become effective until all providers cease using the facility.

Upon completion of dismantling and removal, city approval for the facility shall automatically expire. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 16, 1999. Formerly 19.25.140).


19.25.160 Third party review.

Personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analyses, including geographically based computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of their services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In certain instances, a third party expert may be needed to review the technical data submitted by a provider. The city may require such technical review as part of a permitting process. The costs of the technical review shall be borne by the provider.

The selection of the third party expert may be by mutual agreement between the provider and the city. The expert review is intended to address interference and public safety issues and be a site-specific review of technical aspects of the facilities or a review of the provider’s methodology and equipment used, and not a subjective review of the site which was selected by a provider. Based on the results of the expert review, the city may require changes to the provider’s application. The expert review shall address the following:

(1) The accuracy and completeness of submissions;

(2) The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;

(3) The validity of conclusions reached;

(4) Any specific technical issues designated by the city; and

(5) The potential for utilization of satellites for wireless communication instead of the proposed cell tower facilities. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 14-99 §§ 2, 17, 1999. Formerly 19.25.150).

19.25A.090 Design and concealment standards for small wireless facility deployments.

Small wireless facility deployments permitted inside or outside the right-of way shall conform to the following design standards. These design standards serve as concealment elements for the purposes of an eligible facilities request.

(1) Small wireless facilities attached to existing or replacement nonwooden light poles and other nonwooden poles in the right-of-way or nonwooden poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) Enclosure Location and Dimensions. The applicant shall minimize to the extent possible the antenna and equipment space and shall use the smallest amount of enclosure possible to fit the necessary equipment. The antennas and equipment shall be located using the following methods in priority order:

(i) Concealed Completely within the Pole or Pole Base. Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures (including disconnect switches and other appurtenant devices) shall be fully concealed within the pole, unless such concealment is otherwise technically infeasible, or is incompatible with the pole design. If within the pole base, the base shall meet the ADA requirements and not impact the pedestrian access route.

(ii) Located on a Pole. If located on a pole, antennas and associated equipment enclosures must be camouflaged to appear as an integral part of the pole or flush-mounted to the pole, meaning no more than six inches off of the pole, and the equipment enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility shall be the minimum size necessary for the intended purpose. The equipment enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the pole (including interior conduit), including wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the pole, may not exceed 28 cubic feet. If the equipment enclosure is permitted on the exterior of the pole, the applicant is required to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs. The furthest point of any antenna or equipment enclosure may not extend more than 24 inches from the face of the pole.

(iii) Underground in a Utility Vault. If located underground, the access lid to the equipment enclosure shall be located outside the footprint of any pedestrian curb ramp and shall have a nonskid surface meeting ADA requirements if located within an existing pedestrian access route.

(iv) On Private Property. If located on private property, the applicant shall submit a copy of an executed permission document with the private property owner prior to the right-of-way permit issuance.

(b) The furthest point of any antenna or equipment enclosure may not extend more than 24 inches from the face of the pole. Any equipment or antenna enclosures must meet WSDOT height clearance requirements.

(c) All conduit, cables, wires and fiber must be routed internally in the nonwooden pole. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires and fiber is required within mounting brackets, shrouds, canisters or sleeves if attaching to exterior antennas or equipment.

(d) An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than six feet above the height of the existing pole and the diameter may not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, unless the applicant can demonstrate that more space is needed. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design so that it appears as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or painted to match the pole, and shall be shrouded or screened to blend with the pole except for canister antennas that shall not require screening. All cabling and mounting hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall be fully concealed and integrated with the pole.

(e) Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is replacing or the neighboring pole design standards used within the contiguous right-of-way.

(f) The height of any replacement pole may not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the existing pole or the minimum additional height necessary; provided, that the height of the replacement pole cannot be extended further by additional antenna height.

(g) The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the city’s setback and sidewalk clearance requirements and shall, to the extent technically feasible, not be more than a 25 percent increase of the existing nonwooden pole measured at the base of the pole, unless additional diameter is needed in order to conceal equipment within the base of the pole, and shall comply with the requirements in subsection (5)(d) of this section.

(h) The use of the pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(2) Wooden Pole Design Standards. Small wireless facilities located on wooden poles shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) The wooden pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a taller pole for the purpose of accommodating a small wireless facility; provided, that the replacement pole shall not exceed a height that is a maximum of 10 feet taller than the existing pole, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height extension is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities.

(b) A pole extender may be used instead of replacing an existing pole but may not increase the height of the existing pole by more than 10 feet, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and such height increase is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. A “pole extender” as used herein is an object affixed between the pole and the antenna for the purpose of increasing the height of the antenna above the pole. The pole extender shall be painted to approximately match the color of the pole and shall substantially match the diameter of the pole measured at the top of the pole.

(c) Replacement wooden poles must either match the approximate color and materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used by the pole owner in the city.

(d) Antennas, equipment enclosures, and all ancillary equipment, boxes and conduit shall be colored or painted to match the approximate color of the surface of the wooden pole on which they are attached.

(e) Antennas shall not be mounted more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole.

(f) Antennas should be placed in an effort to minimize visual clutter and obtrusiveness. Multiple antennas are permitted on a wooden pole; provided, that each antenna enclosure shall not be more than three cubic feet in volume.

(g) A canister antenna may be mounted on top of an existing wooden pole, which may not exceed the height requirements described in subsection (2)(a) of this section. A canister antenna mounted on the top of a wooden pole shall not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, and shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The canister antenna must be placed to look as if it is an extension of the pole. In the alternative, the applicant may propose a side-mounted canister antenna, so long as the inside edge of the antenna is no more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole. All cables shall be concealed either within the canister antenna or within a sleeve between the antenna and the wooden pole.

(h) The furthest point of any antenna or equipment enclosure may not extend more than 24 inches from the face of the pole. Any equipment or antenna enclosures must meet WSDOT height clearance requirements.

(i) An omnidirectional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing wooden pole, provided such antenna is no more than four feet in height and is mounted directly on the top of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket.

(j) All related equipment, including but not limited to ancillary equipment, radios, cables, associated shrouding, microwaves, and conduit that are mounted on wooden poles shall not be mounted more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required, and is confirmed in writing by the pole owner.

(k) Equipment for small wireless facilities must be attached to the wooden pole, unless otherwise permitted to be ground-mounted pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section. The equipment must be placed in the smallest enclosure possible for the intended purpose. The equipment enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the utility pole, including wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the pole, may not exceed 28 cubic feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more closely integrate with the pole design and do not cumulatively exceed 28 cubic feet. The applicant is encouraged to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(l) An applicant who desires to enclose both its antennas and equipment within one unified enclosure may do so; provided, that such enclosure is the minimum size necessary for its intended purpose and the enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the pole, including wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the pole does not exceed 28 cubic feet. The unified enclosure may not be placed more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner. To the extent possible, the unified enclosure shall be placed so as to appear as an integrated part of the pole or behind banners or signs; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(m) The visual effect of the small wireless facility on all other aspects of the appearance of the wooden pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible.

(n) The use of the wooden pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(o) The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the city’s setback and sidewalk clearance requirements and shall not be more than a 25 percent increase of the existing utility pole measured at the base of the pole.

(p) All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of the pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The number of conduits shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to accommodate the small wireless facility.

(3) Small wireless facilities attached to existing buildings shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) Small wireless facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building’s architectural theme.

(b) The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is discouraged.

(c) New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the architecture of the existing building.

(d) Small wireless facilities shall use the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building.

(e) Skirts or shrouds shall be used on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited.

(f) Small wireless facilities shall be painted and textured to match the adjacent building surfaces.

(4) Small wireless facilities mounted on cables strung between existing utility poles shall conform to the following standards:

(a) Each strand-mounted facility shall not exceed three cubic feet in volume;

(b) Only one strand-mounted facility is permitted per cable between any two existing poles;

(c) The strand-mounted devices shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest utility pole, in no event more than five feet from the pole unless a greater distance is technically necessary or is required by the pole owner for safety clearance;

(d) No strand-mounted device shall be located in or above the portion of the roadway open to vehicular traffic;

(e) Ground-mounted equipment to accommodate a strand-mounted facility is not permitted except when placed in preexisting equipment cabinets;

(f) Pole-mounted equipment shall comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section;

(g) Such strand-mounted devices must be installed to cause the least visual impact and without excess exterior cabling or wires (other than the original strand); and

(h) Strand-mounted facilities are prohibited on nonwooden poles.

(5) General Requirements.

(a) Ground-mounted equipment in the rights-of-way is prohibited, unless such facilities are placed underground or the applicant can demonstrate that pole-mounted or undergrounded equipment is technically infeasible. If ground-mounted equipment is necessary, then the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan. Generators located in the rights-of-way are prohibited.

(b) No equipment shall produce noise in violation of Chapter 8.30 BMC.

(c) Small wireless facilities are not permitted on traffic signal poles.

(d) Replacement poles and new poles shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction and sidewalk clearance standards, city ordinance, and state and federal laws and regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way. Further, the location of any replacement or new pole must: be physically possible, comply with applicable traffic warrants, not interfere with utility or safety fixtures (e.g., fire hydrants, traffic control devices), and not adversely affect the public welfare, health or safety.

(e) Failure to bring a permitted wireless facility online and into operation within three months of completion of construction shall be deemed an abandonment of the facility and the permit shall expire. The applicant shall remove all facilities within 30 days of written notice from the city. In addition to any other remedy which the city may have, the facility may be removed by the city or its contractor and the owner billed for the actual costs of removal.

(f) No signage, message or identification other than the manufacturer’s identification or identification required by governing law is allowed to be portrayed on any antenna or equipment enclosure. Any permitted signage shall be located on the equipment enclosures and be of the minimum amount possible to achieve the intended purpose (no larger than four by six inches); provided, that signs are permitted as concealment element techniques where appropriate.

(g) Antennas and related equipment shall not be illuminated except for security reasons, required by a federal or state authority, or unless approved as part of a concealment element plan.

(h) Side arm mounts for antennas or equipment must be the minimum extension necessary and may not create a gap of more than 12 inches for wooden poles and no more than six inches for nonwooden poles between the pole and the antennas or equipment.

(i) The preferred location of a small wireless facility on a pole is the location with the least visible impact.

(j) Antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary equipment, conduit and cable, shall not dominate the structure or pole upon which they are attached.

(k) Except for locations in the right-of-way, small wireless facilities are not permitted on any property containing a residential use in the residential zones.

(l) The city may consider the cumulative visual effects of small wireless facilities mounted on poles within the rights-of-way when assessing proposed siting locations so as to not adversely affect the visual character of the city. This provision shall not be applied to limit the number of permits issued when no alternative sites are reasonably available nor to impose a technological requirement on the applicant.

(m) These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner that dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted that provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape. (Ord. 11-19 § 6, 2019).


19.25A.100 New poles in the rights-of-way for small wireless facilities.

(1) New poles within the rights-of-way are only permitted if the applicant can establish that:

(a) The proposed small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing utility pole or light pole, electrical transmission tower or on a site outside of the public rights-of-way such as a public park, public property, building, transmission tower or in or on a nonresidential use in a residential zone whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure;

(b) The proposed small wireless facility complies with the applicable requirements of BMC 19.25A.090.

(c) The proposed small wireless facility receives approval for a concealment element design, as described in subsection (3) of this section;

(d) The proposed small wireless facility also complies with the Shoreline Management Act, and SEPA, if applicable; and

(e) No new poles shall be located in a critical area or associated buffer required by the city’s critical areas management ordinance (Chapter 12.08 BMC), except when determined to be exempt pursuant to said ordinance.

(2) The concealment element design shall include the design of the screening, fencing or other concealment technology for a tower, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless facility, including but not limited to fiber and power connections.

(a) The concealment element design should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of the small wireless facility. The proposed pole or structure should have similar designs to existing neighboring poles in the rights-of-way, including similar height to the extent technically feasible. Any concealment element design for a small wireless facility on a decorative pole should attempt to mimic the design of such pole and integrate the small wireless facility into the design of the decorative pole. Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, using coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color, and texture – or the appearance thereof – as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to use designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure. Further, applicant designs should, to the extent technically possible, comply with the generally applicable design standards adopted pursuant to BMC 19.25A.090.

(3) If the director has already approved a concealment element design, either for the applicant or another small wireless facility along the same public right-of-way or for the same pole type, then the applicant shall use a substantially similar concealment element design, unless it can show that such concealment element design is not physically or technically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards.

(4) Even if an alternative location is established pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section, the director may determine that a new pole in the right-of-way is in fact a superior alternative based on the impact to the city, the concealment element design, the city’s comprehensive plan and the added benefits to the community.

(a) Prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a new pole or ground-mounted equipment in the right-of-way, the applicant must obtain a site-specific agreement from the city to locate such new pole- or ground-mounted equipment. This requirement also applies to replacement poles that are higher than the replaced pole, and the overall height of the replacement pole and the proposed small wireless facility is more than 60 feet.

(5) These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner that dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted that provide similar or greater protections of the streetscape. (Ord. 11-19 § 6, 2019).


19.25A.110 Appeals.

Administrative approval or denial of small wireless permits is final. An appeal from any permit approval or denial under this chapter may be taken only to superior court. (Ord. 11-19 § 6, 2019).

19.28.010 Purposes.

These regulations are established in order to assure that parking facilities are properly designed and located in order to meet the parking needs created by specific uses, and ensure their usefulness, protect the public safety, and, where appropriate, buffer and transition surrounding land uses from their impact. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.28.020 Basic regulations for off-street parking.

(1) Off-street parking shall be provided subject to the provisions of this chapter for: 

(a) Any new building constructed;

(b) Any addition or enlargement of an existing building and use; and

(c) Any change in the occupancy of any building or the manner in which any use is constructed that would result in additional parking spaces being required.

(2) Except for those exempted in the HC zone as allowed under BMC 19.20.090(2)(d)(i), and cottage housing developments, the required parking spaces or garages shall be located on the same building site or development and shall be located near to the site entrance, if feasible, so as to reduce the need for long driveways.

(3) All off-street parking spaces and areas required by this chapter shall be designed and maintained to be fully usable for the duration of the use requiring such areas and spaces.

(4) On-street parking within public or private streets, driveways, or drives shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements, except where allowed by this chapter.

(5) Whenever the computation of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this section results in a fractional parking space, one additional parking space shall be required for one-half or more fractional space and any fractional space less than one-half of a parking space shall not be counted.

(6) Temporary use of off-street parking spaces for nonparking purposes will not violate this chapter if such use is specifically approved by the planning director.

(7) Parking facilities constructed or substantially reconstructed subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whether or not required, shall conform to the design standards set forth in this chapter.

(8) All parking lots allowed or required under this code shall also allow electric vehicle stations and/or infrastructure. (Ord. 34-19 § 20, 2019; Ord. 15-17 § 7, 2017; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.28.030 Design standards.

Design standards are established by this section to set basic minimum dimensions and guidelines for design, construction, and maintenance of parking within the residential, commercial, public/institutional and industrial districts.

(1) General. The following standards shall apply to all residential, commercial and industrial districts:

(a) Parking Stall Size. Each standard parking space shall consist of a rectangular area not less than nine feet wide by 19 feet long. All parking spaces should have a vertical clearance of not less than seven and one-half feet.

(b) Compact Stall Size. Stalls designated for use by compact cars may be reduced in size to a minimum of eight feet in width and 16 feet in length.

(c) Parking areas designated for motorcycles shall be approved by the planning director or public works director and shall be designed according to the best available design standards.

(d) All provisions for handicapped spaces shall conform to state law.

(e) Paving. Where required, parking and loading facilities shall be surfaced and maintained with asphalt, concrete, or other permanent, approved surfacing material sufficient to prevent mud, dust, loose material, and other nuisances. Alternate pervious surface materials are encouraged to be utilized in areas where heavy vehicles are not normally traversing. Alternate pervious surface materials shall be encouraged by the planning director and city engineer if shown that such material will not cause adverse effects and that it will remain in a usable condition through maintenance.

(f) Drainage. All parking and loading facilities shall be graded and provided with permanent storm drainage facilities in compliance with Chapter 14.30 BMC. Surfacing, curbing, and drainage improvements shall be sufficient to preclude free flow of water onto adjacent properties or public streets or alleys, and to preclude standing pools of water within the parking facility.

(g) Safety Features. Parking and loading facilities shall meet the following standards:

(i) Safety barriers, protective bumpers or curbing, and directional markers shall be provided to assure pedestrian/vehicular safety, efficient utilization, protection to landscaping, and to prevent encroachment onto adjoining public or private property.

(ii) Visibility of pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists shall be assured when entering and exiting parking areas and individual parking spaces, and when circulating within a parking facility.

(iii) Internal circulation patterns, and the location and traffic direction of all access drives, shall be designed and maintained in accord with accepted principles of traffic engineering and traffic safety.

(h) Lighting. Lights provided to illuminate any parking facility or paved area shall be designed to reflect away from residential use and motorists on adjacent street facilities. It is the intent to maintain light standards in a low-profile design and to be compatible with the city-approved architectural design. 

(i) Noise. Areas used for primary circulation, for frequent idling of vehicle engines, or for loading activities shall be designed and located to minimize impacts on adjoining properties, including provisions for screening or sound baffling.

(j) Screening and Landscaping. Screening and landscaping of parking areas shall be provided subject to the requirements of Chapter 19.29 BMC.

(k) Striping. All parking stalls shall be clearly outlined with single lines on the surface of the parking facility or any other permanent space designator (tree, shrubs, etc.), approved by the planning director. In all parking facilities, all aisles, approach lanes, and maneuvering areas shall be clearly marked with directional arrows and lines to expedite traffic movement.

(l) Maneuvering. Parking and maneuvering areas shall be arranged so that any vehicle entering a public right-of-way can do so traveling in a forward direction, except for single-family residential developments.

(2) Residential. The following design standards shall apply to the residential districts and developments: 

(a) Covered off-street parking spaces in a garage or carport shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and 19 feet in depth of unobstructed area provided for parking purposes. The required minimum measurements may not include the exterior walls or support of the structure.

(b) Driveways providing access to garages, carports and parking areas serving four or less dwelling units shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width. Exceptions may be approved by the planning director.

(c) Driveways providing access to garages, carports, and open parking spaces serving five or more dwelling units shall be a minimum width of 24 feet wide.

(d) Notwithstanding subsections (2)(b) and (c) of this section, all driveways and accessway widths and designs must be approved by the fire department for purposes of emergency accessibility. 

(e) No property owner shall sublease, subrent or otherwise make available to residents of other properties the off-street parking spaces required by this section.

(f) All required covered off-street parking spaces shall be located conveniently accessible to the dwelling unit served by such parking space.

(g) Residential developments which provide private streets shall be planned, designed and constructed to meet the minimum engineering and fire department requirements for private streets.

(3) Commercial, Industrial, Institutional, Community Facilities. The following design standards shall apply to commercial, industrial, institutional and community facility uses:

(a) Those areas designated for use by motorcycles shall consist of a minimum usable area of 54 square feet.

(b) Driveways shall comply with the city’s Development Guidelines and Public Works Standards.

(ii) Planting Schedule. The planting schedule shall indicate common names, quantities, sizes at planting, and spacing for all plants. The final site plan will show individual trees and shrubs. Ground cover may be expressed as on-center (o.c.) placement.

(iii) Cost Estimate. If a performance assurance is proposed as an alternative, the applicant must submit a current estimate of the cost to install the required landscaping. The planning director may approve the submitted cost estimate or require that written bids be obtained.

(iv) Elevation Drawing. An elevation and/or cross-section drawing is required for steep slopes that exceed five feet in height and are steeper than one unit vertical in one and one-half units horizontal (1:1.5). The scale should be appropriate to show structures and plantings at time of installation.

(v) Grading Details. If land contours are to be altered, existing and proposed grading contours with spot elevations shall be drawn to scale on the preliminary and final site or landscape plan. All landscaped mounds, ditches, and gullies are to be shown.

(vi) Existing Tree Survey. Applicants shall submit a tree survey indicating the name, caliper, and location of any existing tree greater than six inches in caliper at four and one-half feet above grade. The boundaries and species of any stands of trees shall be detailed. The plan shall note which trees shall be retained, using the drip line boundary delineation to locate retained trees on the grading plan. An effort shall be made to preserve existing trees, especially conifers, on site and incorporate them into overall design.

(c) Revisions. A revised landscaping plan may be approved by the planning director in the event there are significant physical elements which are discovered during or after plan review which may prevent installation of the required landscaping. Revisions to the approved landscaping plan may be required if the installed landscaping has failed to perform as intended during the maintenance warranty period. 

(3) Performance Assurance. Before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any project is issued, the approved landscaping must be installed, unless the developer provides a performance security to guarantee the installation of the landscaping. The amount of the security will be based on 150 percent of the projected cost to install the approved landscaping. (Ord. 13-19 § 3, 2019; Ord. 15-17 § 9, 2017; Ord. 27-16 § 11, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.29.060 Design standards.

Property owners are encouraged to retain the existing trees, especially conifers, and other native vegetation on a site to the maximum extent possible. The following design standards should be followed and implemented in the creation of a final landscaping plan. The plan should encourage a low maintenance, quality design. Design with drought-resistant plants and minimal grass area is encouraged to promote water conservation. Design shall include utilization of native vegetation.

(1) Facade Buffers. This design pertains to new commercial and manufacturing buildings or uses within the following zones: CC, GC, HC, HDR, LI, NMU; to new multifamily buildings containing more than two units; and to existing commercial, manufacturing or multifamily residential improvements which exceed 30 percent of the appraised value of the structure(s).

(a) Facade buffers should accent the character of the building. Street trees, window boxes, planters and hanging pots within the public right-of-way are acceptable, subject to approval by the planning director or city engineer. These items should not create a hazard by inhibiting pedestrian movement in the right-of-way and shall comply with required sight distances at intersections. The planting material should soften the transition between the pavement and the building. Blank building walls should be softened by landscaping. Plantings arranged formally or informally. Vegetation used within low impact development facilities shall be considered as part of these landscaping requirements as approved by the public works director.

(b) Within the historical commercial zone, potted street trees, planter boxes and street furniture within the public right-of-way may be substituted for the above facade landscaping upon approval by the design review committee or decision maker and recommended for approval by the city planning director or city engineer.

(2) Barrier Buffers. This design pertains to new commercial and manufacturing buildings or uses within the following zones: CC, GC, HDR, LI, NMU, and existing commercial and manufacturing improvements which exceed 30 percent of the appraised value of the structure(s) within any 12-month period, where the commercial and/or manufacturing use abuts or is across an alley from a residential zone or use. These requirements also apply to mobile home parks/subdivisions, recreational vehicle parks and storage containment facilities.

Barrier buffers are to be provided along interior side and rear property lines as a minimum unless otherwise noted. These buffers should create a sight-obscuring barrier between incompatible zones and/or uses. The barrier shall be constructed along rear and interior side perimeters of site as follows:

(a) A minimum of a 20-foot-wide strip planted with evergreen trees or shrubs which provide a visual screen from the ground to the top. The trees must be at least six feet tall at time of planting and spaced to grow together within three years. An alternative consisting of a 10-foot-wide planting strip with a sight-obscuring six-foot wooden fence and six-foot-tall evergreens spaced to grow together within three years may be approved by the decision maker.

(b) Evergreen shrubs and ground cover to provide 75 percent coverage of landscaping area within two years after planting.

(3) Visual Relief Buffers. This design pertains to new commercial and manufacturing buildings and uses within the following zones: CC, GC, HDR, LI, NMU; to new multifamily structures containing more than two units; and to commercial, manufacturing or multifamily residential improvements which exceed 30 percent of the appraised value of the structure(s). A transparent buffer to provide visual relief between compatible land use areas or to soften the appearance of parking lots. The buffer shall be constructed around site perimeter as follows:

(a) A minimum of a five-foot-wide strip for all interior lots and a 10-foot-wide strip for all lots abutting a road or street to be planted with trees of which 70 percent may be deciduous. One tree shall be provided for each 30 linear feet of landscaped area. The trees may be spaced irregularly or clustered.

(b) Evergreen shrubs and ground cover to provide 75 percent coverage of landscaped area within two years after planting.

(c) Vegetation used within low impact development facilities shall be considered as part of these landscaping requirements as approved by the public works director.

(4) Parking Lot Canopy Buffers. This design pertains to the interior of all parking lots which have 20 or more spaces, to residential, commercial and manufacturing for new developments and to improvements which exceed 30 percent of the appraised value of the existing structure(s) within any 12-month period. Parking lots shall be designed to provide a minimum of 50 percent canopy shading within 10 years of planting. These buffers will provide shade, cool spots and transparent buffers within the parking lot. All required landscaping area widths shall be measured from back of curb to back of curb.

(a) A planting strip at least eight feet wide with trees spaced no more than 30 feet apart shall separate head-to-head parking stalls. At least 30 percent of the required trees shall be evergreen. Planting strips and islands shall be a minimum of eight feet wide in all CC, GC, LI, NMU and HDR zones.

(b) Landscaped islands the same dimensions and alignment as the parking spaces shall be installed at the ends of each row of parking spaces and separating every 12 spaces within rows of parking spaces. Each landscaped island shall have at least one tree, and at least 30 percent of the trees shall be evergreens. The number of required parking spaces may be reduced by one space for each landscaped island provided.

(c) Evergreen shrubs and ground cover shall be planted within the planting strips and islands to provide 75 percent coverage of these areas within two years of planting.

(d) Planting strips and landscaped islands within parking lots shall be protected from vehicular access by a curb or landscaping timber border.

(5) Street Trees. This design pertains to new commercial and manufacturing buildings or change of occupancy, as defined by the International Building Code, within the following zones: CC, GC, HC, HDR, LI, and NMU; to new multifamily structures containing more than two units; and to improvements which exceed 30 percent of the appraised value of the existing structure(s) within any 12-month period.

(a) Street trees shall be planted by the land owner or developer in the right-of-way strip of arterial and collector streets between the property line and the edge of the curb or street paving according to city specifications.

(b) Where tree branches might interfere with pedestrians or vehicles in the right-of-way, trees should have a clear trunk area of seven feet above the ground for pedestrian paths, eight feet above bicycle lanes, 15 feet above arterial streets, and 14 feet above all other streets.

(c) Spacing of street trees shall be a minimum of 40 feet apart on arterial streets and up to 30 feet on collector and local streets.

(d) In the historical commercial zone, a combination of potted street trees, lamp posts, planter boxes, hanging baskets or other landscaping or street furniture may be substituted for street trees upon approval by the decision maker as recommended by the planning director and/or city engineer.

(e) Property owners on local access streets are encouraged to plant street trees in accordance with city specifications and recommended species type as adopted by resolution.

(f) Removal, pruning, or topping of any street tree is prohibited without approval by the designated city official. Where authorized, pruning and other maintenance will be to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) tree care standards.

(g) Property owners are encouraged to plant or retain vegetation other than trees within the right-of-way strip between the property line and the edge of the curb or street paving. This shall include vegetation used within low impact development facilities and shall not obscure visibility.

(6) Riparian Zone Buffer. This design pertains to all parcels and sites within the city of Buckley. Original vegetation along streams, wetlands, water sources and drainage channels must be maintained in order to continue natural erosion control and ground water recharge. Permits and procedures established in the city wetlands and critical areas ordinance must be followed in these areas. (Ord. 15-17 § 10, 2017; Ord. 01-12 § 17, 2012; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008).


19.29.070 Installation standards.

(1) Soil Preparation. Before any plant material is installed, all soil shall be prepared to be conducive to the healthy growth of the new plants. The fill is to be rich in organic material; clay soils are not acceptable. All construction materials (concrete residue, rocks, etc.) shall be removed from the landscaping area prior to landscaping. The new topsoil should provide an adequate transition from new topsoil to original native soil and include compost to assist in proper soil composition.

(2) Irrigation. Automated or manual irrigation must be supplied as needed for the first two years to guarantee the survival of the new plants. Irrigation-free landscape schemes and drought-resistant trees and ground cover are encouraged.

(3) Installation. All plans shall indicate the method of planting and tree staking. For trees, soil preparation shall be at least 12 inches deep, or as deep as the root ball, and planting pits shall be three times the diameter of the root ball to be planted. When trees are staked, the staking procedure should not damage the bark, limbs or ball. All stakes and attachments shall be removed by the landscape contractor or property owner by the end of the second growing season. Root barriers shall be provided for all trees and shrubs planted adjacent to planting strips, islands, streets and/or sidewalks.

(4) Minimum Plant Sizes at Installation.

(a) One and one-half-inch minimum caliper for street trees and other deciduous trees.

(b) Six-foot minimum height for evergreen trees.

(c) Twelve-inch minimum height for small shrubs.

(d) Eighteen-inch minimum height for medium and tall shrubs.

(c) Two-and-one-quarter-inch pots, 12 inches o.c.

(d) Grass sod areas to be 100 percent coverage.

(7) Mulching. All planting areas shall be mulched with a uniform two-inch layer of shredded bark mulch. Trees are not to be ringed with mulch. Mulch does not satisfy the requirement for ground cover; it is only used as a weed deterrent. Over-mulching, more than four inches deep, may cause plant health problems.

(8) Quality. Plant materials used shall be equivalent to available nursery-grown stock. All plants shall be compatible with the character and climate of the Pacific Northwest. In some cases exotics may be the preferred plant type depending on wind and moisture exposure. Street trees shall be of a variety suitable for the growing space above and below the ground, with special consideration given to utilities, sidewalks and proximity to the street and buildings.

(9) Grading. Graded slopes in landscaped areas should not exceed a two to one (2:1) slope. All graded landscaping areas should be planted as soon as possible after the disturbance. If landscaped areas are bonded and to be planted at a later date, graded areas shall be temporarily stabilized with erosion control devices.

(10) Sight Obstructions. No landscaping shall impair vision at a corner lot or driveway entrance/exit. (see BMC 19.22.040). In these areas, all landscaping shall be planted and maintained at a height no greater than two and one-half feet above street grade. Tree trunks must be kept clear of branches below 10 feet above street grade.

(a) Corner Lot. A sight distance triangle shall be created when two or more public rights-of-way intersect. Two sides of the triangle should extend no less than 30 feet from the intersection point. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the connection points opposite the intersection point.

Chapter 19.36 NONCONFORMING USES

Sections:

19.36.010    Purpose.

19.36.020    Legal nonconforming uses may continue.

19.36.030    Expansion of uses or structures.

19.36.040    Destruction of premises.

19.36.050    Abandonment.

19.36.060    Change from nonconforming use to any other use.

19.36.070    Pre-existing legal lots of record.

19.36.080    Building safety.


19.36.010 Purpose.

It is necessary to impose limitations upon nonconforming uses in order to gradually bring such uses into harmony with the intent and purpose of the Buckley comprehensive plan and the zoning code. It is thus intended by this chapter not to allow nonconforming uses to be enlarged or expanded or extended, nor to be used as a basis for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 02-01 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981).


19.36.020 Legal nonconforming uses may continue.

Buildings and uses which were legal at time of construction or initiation of use may continue, subject to the limitations of this chapter. If, at the time of construction or initiation of use, a building or use was legal based on the adopted codes of that time, the building or use may continue subject to the limitations of this chapter unless such building or use presents a hazard to the public health, safety, and general welfare in the city’s judgment. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 02-01 § 1, 2001. Formerly 19.36.015).


19.36.030 Expansion of uses or structures.

A nonconforming use shall not be expanded or enlarged by addition of other uses or structures; provided, however, it shall be lawful to construct additions or make improvements to an existing nonconforming single-family residence located in the HC, GC or CC zone of the city, so long as any such construction or remodeling does not exceed 50 percent of the appraised value of the existing structure and the construction or remodeling meets all bulk requirements and permitted uses of Chapter 19.20 BMC; and provided further, that nonconforming outbuildings may be relocated and/or reconstructed in accordance with the provisions of BMC 19.22.050(5) as now written or hereinafter amended. It is also unlawful to attach additional signs to a building or to add or enlarge signs anywhere on the exterior of the premises. A legal nonconforming use may be extended throughout an existing building, but said building or structure shall not be enlarged, except as permitted in this section, unless it is for a use permitted in the zone in which it is located. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 17-94 § 2, 1994; Ord. 13-88 § 1, 1988; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981. Formerly 19.36.020).


19.36.040 Destruction of premises.

Any legal nonconforming building or structure which has been destroyed shall not be used again for nonconforming use, except as provided in this section. “Destruction” is defined as damage which in order to repair would cost more than 80 percent of the structure’s value prior to its destruction, or where more than 80 percent of the structure’s floor area is seriously damaged or destroyed. An existing, legal nonconforming, single-family residential dwelling unit located in the HC, GC or CC zone shall not be subject to this restriction and the destruction of any such nonconforming, single-family dwelling unit may be reconstructed so long as the reconstructed dwelling meets all bulk requirements and uses as set forth in the then-existing NMU zone as set forth in BMC 19.20.050. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 13-88 § 2, 1988; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981. Formerly 19.36.030).


19.36.050 Abandonment.

If any nonconforming use is abandoned or vacant for any reason whatsoever for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use shall be in conformity with the requirements of the zone in which the use was located. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981. Formerly 19.36.040).


19.36.060 Change from nonconforming use to any other use.

Any nonconforming use of land and/or buildings or structures shall not be changed to any other use unless said proposed use is a use that is permitted in the zone of which said legal nonconforming use is located. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981. Formerly 19.36.050).


19.36.070 Pre-existing legal lots of record.

A “nonconforming lot” is one which met applicable zoning ordinance standards as to size, width, depth and other dimensional regulations at the date on which it was created but which, due to the passage of a zoning ordinance, the amendment thereof or the annexation of property to the city, no longer conforms to the current provisions of the zoning ordinance. A lot which was not legally created in accordance with the laws of the local governmental entity in which it was located at the date of the creation is an illegal lot and will not be recognized for development.

(2) Continuation. A nonconforming lot may be developed for any use allowed by the zoning district in which it is located, even though such lot does not meet the size, width, depth and other dimensional requirements of the district, so long as all other applicable site use and development standards are met or a variance from such site use or development standards has been obtained. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 23-89 § 1, 1989; Ord. 19-88 § 1, 1988; Ord. 6-86 § 1, 1986; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981. Formerly 19.36.060).


19.36.080 Building safety.

Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any nonconforming building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any city official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1020 § 9, 1981. Formerly 19.36.070).

19.40.010 Purpose.

This chapter is intended to detail the procedures and responsibilities of the designated official in the processing, consideration and issuance of variances and conditional use permits. In regard to variances, this chapter shall apply to claims that the provisions of the zoning code are unduly prohibitive to reasonable use of property as intended by this title. In regards to conditional use permits, this chapter shall apply after application for consideration and issuance of a conditional use permit subject to the conditions set forth in this title. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 2, 1992).


19.40.020 Variances and authority to grant.

Upon the filing of a proper application, the designated official shall have the authority, subject to provisions of this chapter, to grant, upon such conditions as it may determine, variances from required lot width, depth or area; required front, side or rear yards; required height of buildings, fences and structures; maximum floor area, impervious surface coverage and signage; and required parking. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to give any property owner a right to use any property in any manner which requires a variance, unless a variance for such use has first been granted and is in full force and effect pursuant to all conditions attached thereto. Further, the authority to grant a variance does not extend to use regulations set forth in this title. No variance shall permit a use not permitted in the zone district applicable to a property. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 3, 1992).


19.40.030 Required findings to grant variance.

Each determination granting a variance shall be supported by written findings showing specifically wherein all of the following conditions exist:

(1) Because of unusual conditions applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location, natural features or surroundings, which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of this title would deprive the property of rights and privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located; and

(2) The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located; and

(3) That the granting of such variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare, will not adversely affect the established character of the surrounding neighborhood, and will not be injurious to the property or improvements of such vicinity and/or zone in which the property is located; and

(4) The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of this title could cause undue and unnecessary hardship; and

(5) The requested variance would be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the zoning code and adopted land use policies or comprehensive plan, as applicable. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 4, 1992).


19.40.040 Conditions on variance approvals.

The designated official shall have the authority to impose conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to protect and enhance the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding area, and to assure that the proposed variance fully meets the criteria set forth in BMC 19.40.030. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 5, 1992).


19.40.050 Public hearing required for variance.

Before the designated official may grant, amend or deny any application for a variance, the designated official shall conduct a duly noticed public hearing. Upon completion of the hearing, the decision maker shall grant, amend with conditions or deny with findings the variance application in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 02-18 § 6, 2018; Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 6, 1992).


19.40.060 Expiration of variance grant.

Any variance granted by the designated official shall become null and void if not exercised within the time specified in such variance or, if no time is specified, within one year of the date of approval of such variance. A variance shall be deemed exercised and remain in full force and effect when a building permit has been issued and substantial construction accomplished in reliance upon said permit. If such variance is abandoned or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be reestablished unless authorized in accordance with the procedure for variance prescribed in this chapter. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 7, 1992).


19.40.070 Extension of time for variance permit.

Upon written request by a property owner or his/her authorized representative, also designated in writing, prior to the date of variance expiration, and following consideration at a public meeting, the designated official may grant an extension of time up to but not exceeding one year. Such extension of time shall be based upon a finding that there has been no material change of circumstances applicable to the property since the granting of the variance which would be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 8, 1992). 


19.40.080 Cancellation of a variance. 

A valid variance granted by the designated official may be canceled at any time. Cancellation must be initiated by the owner of the property covered by the variance by means of a written request to the planning director. The variance shall then become null and void 15 calendar days thereafter. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 9, 1992).


19.40.090 Revocation of a variance.

Following a public hearing, the designated official may revoke or add additional conditions to any variance issued on any one or more of the following grounds:

(1) That the approval was obtained by fraud or that erroneous information was presented by the applicant or his/her designated representative and considered in the granting of the variance;

(2) That the variance granted is being, or recently has been, exercised contrary to the terms or conditions of such approval, or in violation of any statute, ordinance, law or regulation;

(3) That the use for which the approval was granted is being so exercised as to constitute a nuisance. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 10, 1992).


19.40.100 Posting of performance bonds.

Notwithstanding the provisions of BMC 19.40.040, whenever a variance is granted upon any condition or limitation, the person seeking the variance may be required to furnish security in the form of money, letter of credit from a bank, or a surety bond in an amount fixed by the designated official to ensure compliance with the conditions and limitations upon which variance is granted. Every such bond shall be a performance bond payable to the city and shall be conditional upon compliance with the conditions and limitations upon which such variance is granted. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 11, 1992).


19.40.110 Appeals of variance determination.

A final action under this chapter with respect to a variance shall be appealed in accordance with BMC Title 20. (Ord. 13-19 § 3, 2019; Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 33-95 § 5, 1995; Ord. 1-92 § 12, 1992).


19.40.120 Conditional use permits and authority to grant.

Certain uses require a special degree of control due to unusual effects or characteristics peculiar to them, or because of size, location, type of equipment used, or demands upon public facilities resulting from such use. Therefore, the designated official shall have the authority subject to provisions of this chapter to grant, upon such conditions as they may determine, a conditional use permit as may be in harmony with the scope and purpose of this title and zone district in which the use is to be located, and the goals, objectives and policies of the Buckley comprehensive plan. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to give any property owner a right to use any property in any manner which requires a conditional use permit, unless a conditional use permit for such use has first been granted and is in full force and effect pursuant to all conditions attached thereto. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 13, 1992).


19.40.130 Required findings to grant conditional use permit.

Each conditional use permit shall be supported by written findings of fact showing specifically wherein all of the following conditions exist:

(1) That the use for which the conditional use permit is applied is specified by this title as being conditionally permitted within and is consistent with the description and purpose of the zone district in which the property is located;

(2) That the granting of such conditional use permit will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare, will not adversely affect the established character of the surrounding neighborhood, and will not be injurious to the property or improvements in such vicinity and/or zone in which the property is located;

(3) That the proposed use is properly located in relation to the other land uses and to transportation and service facilities in the vicinity; and, further, that the use can be adequately served by such public facilities and street capacities without placing an undue burden on such facilities and streets;

(4) That the site is of sufficient size to accommodate the proposed use and all yards, open spaces, walls and fences, parking, loading, landscaping and other such features, as are required by this title or as needed in the opinion of the designated official, and are properly provided to be compatible and harmonious with adjacent and nearby uses;

(5) That the granting of such conditional use permit will not be contrary to the adopted Buckley comprehensive plan, or to the objectives of any code, ordinance, regulation, specifications or plan in effect to implement the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 14, 1992).


19.40.140 Conditions on conditional use permit approvals.

The designated official shall have the authority to impose conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to protect and enhance the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding area and to assure that the proposed use or activity fully meets the findings set forth in BMC 19.40.130. No conditional use permit shall require as a condition the dedication of land for any purpose not reasonably related to the use of property for which the conditional use permit is requested, nor posting of a bond to guarantee installation of public improvements not reasonably related to the use of property for which the conditional use permit is requested. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 15, 1992).

19.40.160 Expiration of conditional use permit.

Any conditional use permit granted by the designated official shall become null and void if not exercised within the time specified in such permit or, if no time is specified, within one year of the date of approval of such permit. A conditional use permit shall be deemed exercised and remain in full force and effect when a building permit has been issued and substantial construction accomplished in reliance upon the conditional use permit. If such permit is abandoned or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, it may not thereafter be reestablished unless authorized in accordance with the procedure prescribed herein for the establishment of a conditionally permitted use.

Upon written request by a property owner or his/her authorized representative prior to the date of conditional use permit expiration, and following consideration at a public meeting, the designated official may grant an extension of time up to but not exceeding one year. Such extension of time shall be based upon a finding that there has been no material change of circumstances applicable to the property since the granting of the permit which would be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 18, 1992).

(2) That the use for which such approval is granted is not being exercised;

(3) That the use for which such approval is granted has ceased to exist or has been suspended for one year or more;

(4) That the conditional use permit granted is being, or recently has been, exercised contrary to the terms of conditions of such approval, or in violation of any statute, ordinance, law or regulation;

19.40.200 Posting of performance bonds.

Every such bond shall be a performance bond and shall be in a form approved by the city attorney, shall be payable to the city and shall be conditioned upon compliance with the conditions and limitations upon which such permit is required. (Ord. 06-16 § 24, 2016; Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1-92 § 21, 1992).

19.52.030    Conditional rezone – Approval.

19.52.040    Conditional rezone – Concomitant agreement.

19.52.050    Conditional rezone – Indication on zoning maps.


19.52.010 Determination – Final action.

In determining what, if any, amendments to this title are to be adopted, the city council shall give due consideration to the proper relationship of such amendments to the comprehensive plan and to this entire title, it being the intent to retain the integrity and validity of the zoning districts herein described, and to avoid any isolated spot zoning changes in the zoning map. Any amendments adopted by the council may be modified from the form in which they were advertised within the limits necessary to relate properly such amendment or amendments to this title. Final action on such modifications shall be subject to review and report of the planning commission prior to final passage by the council. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 652 Art. 9(12), 1961).


19.52.020 Priority of first application.

No application for a change of zoning of any lot, parcel or portion thereof shall be considered by the council within one year of the final action of the council upon a prior application covering any of the same described land. This provision, however, shall not impair the right of the council to propose any amendment of change in the boundaries of any of the districts in this title on its own motion. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 652 Art. 9(12), 1961).


19.52.030 Conditional rezone – Approval.

As a condition precedent to the rezone of any parcel of land, the council may require that within a specified period of time an acceptable building permit application must be submitted for the use intended in the rezone application, and that failure to submit said building permit application and to start construction within a specified period of time will result in the rezone automatically becoming null and void and the property reverting back to the zone that existed at the time of the rezone application; provided, the council may extend any time limits set forth in the ordinance granting a conditional rezone if the application for extension is timely made, good cause is shown why the extension is necessary, and the proposed use remains consistent with the comprehensive plan as in effect at the time the extension is requested. Good cause shall relate to factors beyond the control of the applicant and inadequate financing shall not be considered a good cause. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 20-84 § 1, 1984).


19.52.040 Conditional rezone – Concomitant agreement.

The council may, as a condition of any rezone, require the execution of an agreement concomitant to the rezone ordinance. The concomitant agreement may include such conditions as the council deems necessary in order to neutralize the impact of the proposed property usage upon public services, including streets, parks, utilities and other public services. The concomitant agreement may include both on-site and off-site improvements. The failure to comply with the terms of said concomitant agreement shall result in the rezone immediately becoming null and void and the property reverting to the zone that existed at the time of the rezone application. In the alternative, the council may require specific performance of the agreement. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 20-84 § 2, 1984).


19.52.050 Conditional rezone – Indication on zoning maps.

If a rezone is conditionally granted under the provisions of this chapter, then the zoning map shall reflect the rezone subject to compliance with certain conditions, and the date for compliance shall be written upon the zoning map. A certified copy of the conditional rezone ordinance and the concomitant agreement, if applicable, shall be filed for record with the Pierce County auditor. (Ord. 22-08 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 22-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 20-84 § 3, 1984).

20.24.050 Consolidation with the other government agencies.

The city is also authorized to consolidate project review with the permit procedures of other government agencies. Joint public hearings with other agencies shall be processed as follows:

(1) The director may combine any public hearing on a project permit application with any hearing that may be held by another local, state, regional, federal, or other agency, on the proposed action, as long as:

(a) The hearing is held either within the city limits; and

(b) The requirements of subsection (3) of this section are met.

(2) The applicant may request that the public hearing on a permit application be combined as long as the joint hearing can be held within the time periods set forth in this chapter. In the alternative, the applicant may agree to a particular schedule if additional time is needed in order to complete the hearings.

(3) A joint public hearing may be held with another local, state, regional, federal or other agency and the city, as long as:

(a) The other agency is not expressly prohibited by statute from doing so;

(b) Sufficient notice of the hearing is given to meet each of the agencies’ adopted notice requirements as set forth in statute, ordinance, or rule; and

(c) The agency has received the necessary information about the proposed project from the applicant in enough time to hold its hearing at the same time as the local government hearing. (Ord. 13-19 § 2, 2019).

(1) The applicant shall supply with its application a list and associated map of all property owners, as listed by the Pierce County assessor’s office, within 300 feet of the property boundaries of the property identified in the proposal.

(a) If the proposal is contiguous to property owned by the applicant or more than one property is involved in the proposal, the 300 feet shall be drawn from the exterior boundary of the combined parcels.

(2) To the extent known by the city, other agencies that may have jurisdiction over some aspect of the project permit application shall be identified in the city’s determination of complete application, and included in the list of property owners within 300 feet of the proposed project. (Ord. 13-19 § 2, 2019).


20.28.030 Optional additional public notice.

(1) In addition to the notice requirements of this chapter, the city may require or perform one or more of the following optional methods of providing public notice of any project permit that are authorized for projects that the director determines may be of significant public interest:

20.28.040 Determination of complete application.

A project permit application is complete for the purposes of this chapter when it meets the submission requirements contained in this title and the submission requirements contained in the applicable development regulations.

(1) Within 28 days after receiving a project permit application, the city shall mail a determination to the applicant which states either:

(a) That the application is complete; or

(b) That the application is incomplete and what is necessary to make the application complete.

(2) A project permit application shall be deemed complete under this chapter if the city does not provide a written determination to the applicant that the application is incomplete within 28 days of receiving the application. Notwithstanding a failure to provide a determination of complete application, the city may request additional information throughout review of the proposal.

(3) The city’s determination of complete application shall not preclude the city from requiring additional information, that the applicant correct plans or perform studies at any time if new information is required for project review, or if there are substantial changes in the proposed action.

(a) If additional information is required during the review process, the applicant shall have 90 days to submit the necessary information to the city.

(b) If the applicant either refuses in writing to submit additional information or does not submit the required information within the 90-day period, the director shall determine that the application is abandoned and is therefore withdrawn, according to the procedures of a Type A-1 action. The determination shall be in writing and shall identify the right to appeal.

(4) The Department of Ecology shall review the decision submitted by the city for Department approval, approval with conditions, or denial, as provided in WAC 173-27-200. Ecology’s final decision shall be issued to the city and the applicant within 30 days of the date the city’s decision was submitted to the Department.

(5) When an applicant desires to revise a permit, the applicant must submit detailed plans and text describing the proposed changes. If the administrator determines that the revisions proposed are within the scope and intent of the original permit, consistent with WAC 173-27-100, the administrator may approve the revision.

(a) Revisions to permits under WAC 173-27-100 may be authorized after original permit authorization has expired; provided, that this procedure shall not be used to extend the original permit time requirements or to authorize substantial development after the time limits of the original permit.

(b) Local government shall notify the department in writing of any change to the effective date of a permit with an explanation of the basis for approval of the change. Effective dates may be changed as authorized by RCW 90.58.143.

(5) Any decision on an application for a shoreline permit or revision, whether it is an approval or a denial, shall first be sent to the applicant and parties of record by way of a notice of decision, as outlined in this title.

(a) The notice of decision shall be mailed to the Attorney General Office and the Washington State Department of Ecology by mail, return receipt requested.

(b) After the local appeal period is over or the local appeals are decided, the final decision packet containing all items listed in WAC 173-27-130(3) shall be sent to the Department of Ecology by return receipt requested mail.

(2) Provisions concerning shoreline variances and shoreline conditional uses should be applied in a manner which, while protecting the environment, will assure that a person will be able to use his/her property in a fair and equitable manner.

(a) Review Criteria for Shoreline Conditional Use Permits (SCUP) are governed by WAC 173-27-140, 173-27-160, 173-27-200, and 173-27-210, and SMP 7.2.4. SCUPs can allow greater flexibility in applying use regulations. In authorizing SCUPs, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the city or the Department of Ecology to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use.

(i) Development, including uses that need an SCUP is listed in the shoreline master program under SMP Table 6-1 in Chapter 6.

(b) Variance review criteria are governed by WAC 173-27-170 and 173-27-200 and SMP 7.2.5. Two basic types of variances exist: one landward of the ordinary high water mark and one waterward of the ordinary high water mark. Each has its own set of decision criteria.

(i) Variances are to allow development within the shoreline jurisdiction that requires modified dimensional or bulk standards required by the SMP because the lot has unique conditions on the project site.

(ii) Variances are not permitted for wetlands.

(3) Conditions may be imposed upon development by SSDP, SCUP and variance decisions as necessary to achieve compliance with applicable permit review standards. (Ord. 13-19 § 2, 2019).
