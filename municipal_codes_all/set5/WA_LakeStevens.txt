2.98.030    Special disposition process.

2.98.040    Sale procedure.

2.98.010 Policy.

The City Council declares that it is in the public interest for real property held by the City to be returned to the tax rolls if it is not needed for some present or future municipal use and if it can be sold for a reasonable return. It is therefore the policy of Lake Stevens to dispose of all real property in which the City holds a fee interest, where such property is surplus to its current or future needs, and where such disposition would afford the City a reasonable return from the transaction. For purposes of this chapter, “reasonable return” means sale for tangible and intangible consideration equal to, or greater than, the appraised fair market value (see Section 2.98.040(a)). For purposes of this chapter, “surplus property” means both real property for which the City has no current or future need, as well as real property, which, if disposed of, would be put to a higher or better use for the community at large, which property has been determined to be surplus by the City Council. (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)


2.98.020 Procedures.

Real property declared surplus may be disposed of for a reasonable return or to benefit the public interest by any of the following means determined by the Mayor (as further detailed in Section 2.98.040):

(a)    Sealed bid;

(b)    Auction; 

(c)    Negotiated sale; or

(d)    Special disposition process. (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)


2.98.030 Special disposition process.

In cases where the public interest in a maximum financial or economic return is outweighed by the public benefit, due to factors such as (by way of illustration and not limitation) the unique character or development potential of a given property, the Mayor may recommend for City Council approval the disposal of property by a special disposition process which may include disposal for less than the appraised fair market value or for other cognizable forms of consideration in addition to or in lieu of monetary payment to the City. The special disposition process may include (without limitation) sale by any of the methods set forth at Section 2.98.020, options to purchase, lease purchase transactions, or other commonly used, commercially reasonable means of disposal. Approval for special disposition of property under this section shall include written findings of the City Council setting out and supporting the basis for the City Council’s decision that the public benefit of disposal pursuant to this section outweighs the public interest in a maximum financial or economic return. (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)


2.98.040 Sale procedure.

Except where the special disposition process of Section 2.98.030 is used, the following procedures and requirements shall apply to real property sold as surplus by the City:

(a)    Determination of Fair Market Value/Minimum Acceptable Price.

(1)    The Mayor may present to the Council an appraisal of the surplus property and/or additional information regarding the approximate fair market value of the surplus property for purposes of determining a reasonable return if such property is sold.

(2)    Whether surplus property is to be disposed of by sealed bid, auction or negotiated sale (excluding special disposition process), interested parties shall be advised that the minimum acceptable price shall be the fair market value determined by an appraisal and/or other information as presented by the Mayor in subsection (a)(1) of this section plus reimbursement of 50 percent of the cost of obtaining said appraisal and/or other information.

(b)    Processes/Bid Deposits/Time to Closing.

(1)    Disposition by Sealed Bid. Where a surplus property is sold by sealed bids, the bidding procedures for a surplus property shall be established by the Mayor before bids are sought, including qualifications for bidders. Such procedures shall contain the criteria on which the winning bid will be selected. Any and all bids submitted must be accompanied by a bid deposit in the form of a cashier’s check payable to the City of Lake Stevens in an amount established by the Mayor. Such deposit accompanying the successful bid shall be deposited into escrow until closing on the purchase of the surplus property and payment of the remaining amount of the purchase price shall be made within the time established as part of the bidding procedures for the surplus property. In the event the purchaser is unable to pay the remaining amount within the required time, the bid deposit shall become nonrefundable and may be retained by the City as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, since the calculation of actual damages due to time lost, transaction expenses and other factors will be difficult, if not impossible, to accurately calculate (such damages, as just defined, being referenced hereafter as “liquidated damages”). The bidding procedures may permit the purchaser, at its option, to deposit an extension fee in a stated amount (hereinafter “extension fee”), in which case the time to make full payment shall be extended as provided in the bidding procedures. In the event full payment is not made by the conclusion of the extension period, the extension fee may be retained by the City, along with the initial deposit, as liquidated damages. The City Council reserves the right to waive, or delegate to the Mayor the right to waive, any irregularities in the bid process. The City reserves the right to reject all of the bids if it determines that none of them are responsive to its request for bids or to withdraw a request for bids at any time before it accepts a bid.

(2)    Disposition by Auction. Where property is sold at auction, the bidding procedures for a surplus property shall be established by the Mayor before the auction, including any minimum or reserve price and qualifications for bidders. The prevailing bidder must immediately tender a cash deposit or certified check for deposit into escrow as earnest money to the City Finance Director in the amount established in the bidding procedures. Payment of the remaining amount of the purchase price shall be made within the time period required in the bidding procedures. In the event the purchaser is unable to pay the remaining amount within the required time, the bid deposit shall become nonrefundable and may be retained by the City as liquidated damages. The bidding procedures may permit that the purchaser may, at its option, deposit an extension fee in a stated amount, in which case the time to make full payment shall be extended as provided in the bidding procedures. In the event full payment is not made by the conclusion of the extension period, the extension fee may be retained by the City, along with the initial deposit, as liquidated damages. The City reserves the right to reject all of the bids if the minimum or reserve price is not met or to withdraw the surplus property from the auction process at any time before the auction commences.

(3)    Disposition by Negotiated Sale. The Mayor may directly negotiate with potential purchasers of surplus property or may publish a Request for Qualifications (“RFQ”) or a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) to identify potential purchasers. The City Council reserves all rights to approve any purchase and sale agreement recommended by the Mayor. Where property is sold by negotiated sale, said terms shall be controlled by the negotiated purchase and sale agreement.

(c)    Notification of Sale of Surplus Property. In the event the surplus property is to be disposed of by sealed bid or by auction, the following notification procedures shall be followed:

(1)    A notice of the City’s intent to dispose of the surplus property shall be conspicuously posted on the surplus property no less than two weeks prior to the date set to commence accepting bids or the date set for the auction.

(2)    Notice shall be published in the City’s official newspaper no less than once each week in two consecutive weeks preceding acceptance of sealed bids or the public auction. All notices shall include a description of the surplus property, the procedure by which the surplus property is to be disposed of, any qualifications for bidders, any bid deposits that must be made and the minimum price that will be accepted.

(d)    Failure to Close. In the event that the closing of the sale of surplus property fails to occur under the method selected by the City, or the City fails to conclude a binding purchase and sale agreement with a buyer selected by the City to negotiate with through a special disposition process, RFP, RFQ or other process, the City may terminate the transaction or negotiations and may start a new process (which may be a different process from that previously selected) and/or select the buyer deemed by the City to be the next most responsive in the prior process. (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)


2.98.050 Sale to abutting owners.

If the surplus property can only be put to its highest and best use when aggregated with an abutter’s property because of its size, shape, topography, or other restriction, the surplus property may be negotiated for sale to the abutter, provided:

(a)    The abutter is willing to purchase for the appraised fair market value of the surplus property;

(b)    If more than one qualifying abutter expresses interest in purchasing the surplus property, the City Council may solicit sealed bids from all; and 

(c)    A person shall not be deemed to be an abutter if a right-of-way separates his property from the surplus property unless the City has agreed to vacate the right-of-way in question or the purchase will allow a higher and better use of the abutter’s property not otherwise permitted. (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)


2.98.060 Intergovernmental transfers.

Intergovernmental transfers of real property shall be made in accordance with Chapter 39.33 RCW, RCW 43.09.210 and/or any other applicable statutes, rather than the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)


2.98.070 Sale of real property originally acquired for public utility purposes.

Whenever the City shall determine, by City Council resolution, that any lands originally acquired for public utility purposes is surplus to the City’s needs and is not required for providing continued public utility service, then the City Council by resolution and after a public hearing may cause such lands or property to be sold. Such resolution shall state the fair market value and such other terms and conditions for such disposition as the City Council deems to be in the best public interest (RCW 35.94.040). (Ord. 930, Sec. 1, 2015)

For purposes of example and not limitation, such exhibitions, performances or dances are commonly referred to as table dancing, couch dancing, taxi dancing, lap dancing, private dancing or straddle dancing.

(b)    “Adult entertainment establishment” shall mean any commercial premises to which any patron is invited or admitted and where adult entertainment is provided on a regular basis and as a substantial part of the premises activity, or as further defined and enumerated in Section 14.08.010.

(c)    “Applicant” means the individual or entity seeking an adult entertainment license in the City of Lake Stevens.

(d)    “Applicant control persons” means all partners, corporate officers and directors and any other individuals in the applicant’s business organization who hold a significant interest in the adult entertainment establishment, based on responsibility for management of the adult entertainment business.

(Ord. 957, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 525, Sec. 2, 1996)


4.40.020 Findings of Fact.

Based on public testimony and other evidence presented to it, the City Council makes the following findings of fact:

(a)    The secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this chapter are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and, therefore, such activities must be regulated.

(b)    Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary, because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. This history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution, illegal employment of minors, narcotics and alcoholic beverage law violations, breaches of the peace, tax evasion and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants.

(c)    Proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact, prostitution and related crimes. Concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the City which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(d)    The activities described in subsections B and C of this section occur in the absence of regulation, regardless of whether the adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages.

(e)    It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors, to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible.

(f)    It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees.

(g)    The license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the City in regulating the adult entertainment industry.

(h)    Hidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation. These hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white collar crime elements. In order for the City to effectively protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of its citizens and effectively allocate its law enforcement resources, it is important that the City be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments and the identities and backgrounds of persons responsible for management and control of the adult entertainment establishment.

(i)    It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, but rather to enact time, place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the City in mitigating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.

(j)    In addition, findings of facts developed by the City of Tukwila and other jurisdictions regarding the secondary effects of adult entertainment are attached hereto as Exhibit “A”. (Ord. 957, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 525, Sec. 3, 1996)


4.40.030 Business Hours.

No adult entertainment shall be conducted between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. (Ord. 957, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 525, Sec. 6, 1996)


4.40.040 Activities Not Prohibited.

(a)    This chapter shall not be construed to prohibit:

(1)    Plays, operas, musicals or other dramatic works which are not obscene as defined in subsection (b) of this section;

(2)    Classes, seminars and lectures held for serious scientific or educational purposes; or

(3)    Exhibitions or dances which are not obscene.

(b)    Whether or not activity is obscene shall be judged by consideration of the following factors:

(1)    Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the activity taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; and

(2)    Whether the activity depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, as measured against community standards, sexual conduct as described in RCW 7.48A.010(2)(b); and

(3)    Whether the activity taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. (Ord. 957, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 525, Sec. 7, 1996)


4.40.050 License suspension or revocation.

(a)    The Clerk may, at any time upon the recommendation of the Chief of Police and as provided below, suspend or revoke any license issued under this chapter:

(1)    Where such license was procured by fraud or false representation of fact; or

(2)    For the violation of, or failure to comply with, the provisions of this chapter or any other similar local or state law by the licensee or by any of its servants, agents or employees when the licensee knew or should have known of the violations committed by its servants, agents or employees; or

(3)    For the conviction of the licensee of any crime or offense involving prostitution, promoting prostitution, or transactions involving controlled substances (as that term is defined in Chapter 69.50 RCW) committed on the premises, or the conviction of any of the licensee’s servants, agents or employees of any crime or offense involving prostitution, promoting prostitution, or transactions involving controlled substances (as that term is defined in Chapter 69.50 RCW) committed on the licensed premises when the licensee knew or should have known of the violations committed by its servants, agents or employees.

(b)    A license procured by fraud or misrepresentation shall be revoked. Where other violations of this chapter or other applicable ordinances, statutes or regulations are found, the license shall be suspended for a period of 30 days upon the first such violation, 90 days upon the second violation within a 24-month period, and revoked for third and subsequent violations within a 24-month period, not including periods of suspension.

(c)    The Clerk shall provide at least 10 days prior written notice to the licensee of the decision to suspend or revoke the license. Such notice shall inform the licensee of the right to appeal the decision to the hearing examiner or other designated hearing body and shall state the effective date of such revocation or suspension and the grounds for revocation or suspension.

(d)    Notification shall be by personal service or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of the decision. Notice mailed to the address on file shall be deemed received three days after mailing. The notice shall specify the grounds for the suspension or revocation. The suspension or revocation shall become effective 10 days from the date the notice is delivered or deemed received, unless the person affected thereby files a written request with the Planning and Community Development Department for a hearing before the Hearing Examiner within such 10-day period. The Hearing Examiner or other hearing body shall render its decision within 15 days following the close of the appeal hearing. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Hearing Examiner or other designated hearing body shall have the right to appeal the decision to the Snohomish County Superior Court within 14 days of the Hearing Examiner decision, by writ of certiorari or mandamus. The decision of the Clerk shall be stayed during the pendency of any administrative and judicial appeals except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.

(e)    Where the Lake Stevens Building Official, Fire Marshal or the Snohomish County Health Department finds that any condition exists upon the premises of an adult entertainment establishment which constitutes a threat of immediate serious injury or damage to persons or property, said official may immediately suspend any license issued under this chapter pending a hearing in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. The official shall issue notice setting forth the basis for the action and the facts that constitute a threat of immediate serious injury or damage to persons or property, and informing the licensee of the right to appeal the suspension to the Hearing Examiner or other designated hearing body under the same appeal provisions set forth in subsection (c) of this section; provided, however, that a suspension based on threat of immediate serious injury or damage shall not be stayed during the pendency of the appeal. (Ord. 957, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 525, Sec. 8, 1996)

(Ord. 476, 1995)


6.16.080 Sewer Connection Charges -- Payment Due.

(a)    At any time following preliminary approval and prior to final approval of a subdivision, or short subdivision, or at the time a building permit is requested for an individual lot not previously covered under this section by a subdivision or short subdivision, and before a permit is issued, the property owner must pay to the City, in addition to any permit fee, stub fee, or other charge which may be due, an amount of money which shall constitute a connection charge, consisting of a Charge-in-Lieu-of-Assessment (if applicable), a General Facilities Connection Charge, and a Lake Stevens Sewer District partial-charge-in-lieu-of-assessment (if applicable), as specified below. The connection charge must be paid in full before connection to the public sewers of the City is permitted. The connection charge will be the current rate set by resolution at the time of preliminary approval for a subdivision or short subdivision and will not be subject to increase as long as the preliminary approval is active. The developer/property owner will pay total payment owing prior to final approval of a subdivision, or short subdivision.

If an existing property owner has an on-site treatment and if the City Council approves, and if the property owner pays at least ten percent thereof, and an administrative fee as set by resolution, the balance of the Charge-in-lieu-of-assessment and General Facilities Connection Charge portions of the connection charge may be paid in not more than 5 equal annual installments or less, plus interest at a rate determined each year, based on the State Investment Pool rate available to the City. The interest shall be the highest rate for the previous year from the date of the payment agreement, plus 2%, payable annually on the unpaid balance, provided however, that the interest rate charge shall not be less than 5% nor exceed the highest rate permissible under RCW 19.52.020 and that the unpaid balance plus interest shall be and remain a recorded lien against the property prior to any other charges whatsoever, except taxes. A late fee of 10%of the due installment payments including interest will be charged for each installment that remains unpaid for more than 15 days after its due date. In addition if any installment remains unpaid in excess of 30 days, the City may initiate foreclosure procedures for the full amount of the unpaid principal and interest including all reasonable costs and attorneys fees.

(b)    If the property to receive service under the permit is not platted, then all of that property owned by the same person in a contiguous area, which at that time has not been subject to special assessments for both general facilities, and for the public sewer into which it is to be connected, and which can be served by that public sewer, must be covered by the connection charge, in whole or in part.

(c)    If such property is platted, then only the lot to be served need be covered by the permit, and the connection charge, if not previously paid.

(d)    Commercial/industrial development shall be charged based upon equivalent residential units or contracted rates.

(e)    The Lake Stevens Sewer District partial charge in lieu of assessment must be paid in full if required.

6.24.030 Minimum Project Size.

To be eligible for a reimbursement agreement, the estimated cost of the proposed improvement must be not less than five thousand dollars.

The determination of the Public Works Director shall be final.


6.24.040 Application.

An application for reimbursement agreement shall be made on a form provided by the city. The application fee shall be set by council resolution and shall be submitted to the city with the written application and shall be accompanied by:

A.    Preliminary utility design drawings:

B.    Itemized estimate of construction costs prepared and signed by a licensed civil engineer or in the form of a bid submitted by a qualified contractor (if more than one bid has been obtained, all bids must be submitted to the city);

C.    A scaled vicinity drawing, stamped by a licensed civil engineer or licensed land surveyor depicting the proposed improvements, the location, the proposed benefitted area, dimensions and county assessor’s numbers for each tax parcel, size of parcels, and evaluations where necessary for determining benefits;

D.    A separate legal description for each tax parcel within the benefitted area; and

2.    The proposed improvements fall within the description of sewer facilities as those terms are described in RCW Chapter 35.91; and

3.    The proposed improvements are not constructed or currently under construction.

B.    In the event all of the above criteria are not satisfied, the Public Works Director may condition approval as necessary in order for the application to conform to such criteria, or shall deny the application.

The applicant may obtain a review of the final determination by filing a request therefor with the City Clerk no later than ten (10) days after a copy of the final determination is mailed to the applicant at the address listed on the application.

C.    I reviewing a final determination, the City Council shall apply the criteria set forth above, and shall uphold the decision of the Public Works Director unless evidence clearly demonstrates that the criteria have been satisfied.


6.24.070 Determination of Reimbursement Area Boundary and Reimbursement Fee.

The Public Works Director shall define the reimbursement area for all approved applications based upon a determination of which parcels did not contribute to the original cost of the sewer facility for which the reimbursement agreement applies and which may subsequently tap in to or use the same, including not only those which may connect directly thereto, but also those who may connect to laterals or branches connecting thereto. An estimated amount of the reimbursement fee shall be established so that each property will pay a share of the costs of the improvements, which is proportional to the benefits which accrue to the property.


6.24.080 Reimbursement Agreement must be Recorded.

A.    In order to become effective, a reimbursement agreement must be recorded with the Snohomish County Auditor within (30) thirty days of approval by the city. It shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant to record the reimbursement agreement.

6.24.090 Written Agreement - Payment of City Costs in Excess of Application Fee.

Upon approval of the application, determination of the estimated costs of construction, the reimbursement area and estimated fees by the Public Works Director, the applicant shall sign a reimbursement agreement in the form supplied by the city. The signed agreement, the application and supporting documents, together with the Public Works Director’s estimate of cost of construction, and determination of reimbursement area and estimated fees shall be presented to the City Council with a request that the City Council authorize the Mayor to sign the reimbursement agreement on behalf of the city.

In the event costs incurred by the city for engineering or other professional consultant services required in processing the application exceed the amount of the application fee, the Public Works Director shall so advise the City Council and Council approval shall be conditioned upon receipt of payment by the applicant of an additional amount sufficient to compensate the city for its actual costs in excess of the application fee.


6.24.100 Construction and Acceptance of Improvements - Recording of Final Fees.

A.    After the reimbursement agreement has been signed by both parties, and all necessary permits and approvals have been obtained, the applicant shall construct the improvements, and upon completion, request final inspection and acceptance of the improvements by the city, subject to any required obligation to repair defects. An appropriate bill of sale, easement and any other document needed to convey the improvements to the city and to insure right-of-access for maintenance and replacement shall be provided, along with documentation of the actual costs of the improvements and a certification by the applicant that all of such costs have been paid.

B.    In the event that actual costs are less than the Public Works Director’s estimate used in calculating the estimated fees by ten percent or more, the Public Works Director shall recalculate the fees, reducing them accordingly, and shall cause a revised list of fees to be recorded with the county auditor.


6.24.110 Collection of Reimbursement Fees - No Liability for Failure to Collect.

A.    Subsequent to the recording of a reimbursement agreement, the city shall not permit connection of any property within the reimbursement area to any sewer or water facility constructed pursuant to the reimbursement agreement, unless the share of the costs of such facilities required by the recorded agreement is first paid to the city.

B.    Upon receipt of any reimbursement fees, the city shall deduct a six percent administrative fee and remit the balance of the reimbursement fees to the party entitled to the fees pursuant to the agreement. In the event that through error, the city fails to collect a required reimbursement fee prior to approval of connection to a sewer facility, the city shall make diligent efforts to collect such fee, but shall under no circumstances be obligated to make payment to the party entitled to reimbursement, or in any other way be liable to such party, unless such reimbursement fee has actually been paid to the city.


6.24.120 Disposition of Undeliverable Reimbursement Fees.

In the event that, after reasonable effort, the party to which reimbursement fees are to be paid pursuant to a reimbursement agreement cannot be located, and upon the expiration of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date fees were collected by the city, the fees shall become the property for the city and shall be revenue to the city sewer and water utility.

8.04.010 Mandatory Collection - Rationale - Exceptions.

(a)    No place of human habitation within the City shall be permitted to refuse to subscribe to and pay for the solid waste disposal and recycling service provided by this chapter. The City Council finds that mandatory disposal of solid waste through a City-organized solid waste disposal utility is important to the health and welfare of the citizens of the City. The City Council finds that all citizens benefit from the orderly and sanitary disposal of solid waste even though some residences and businesses generate little or no solid waste subject to disposal by the solid waste utility. Therefore, the fact that a dwelling or business generates no solid waste shall not exempt the property owner or tenant from the payment of the regular charges established for the solid waste disposal service.

(b)    The City Council further finds that because the City is providing for the health and welfare of its citizens by providing solid waste utility and recycling services to its citizens, the citizens should be required to compensate the City or its contractor for said services in order to receive said services. Therefore, the failure to pay for said services shall authorize the City to file a lien against the property affected and the City may foreclose said lien according to law.

(c)    It is unlawful for anyone other than the City solid waste collection and disposal utility or the City’s contractor to collect solid waste from waste receptacle containers in the City for compensation. This prohibition shall not prevent a resident from removing waste or building debris from their property, nor shall it prevent the removal of other debris related to any home or yard improvement project by the resident or their representative.

In this chapter, unless a different meaning plainly is required:

A.    "Person" includes any natural person, partnership, joint stock company, unincorporated association or society, or a corporation of any character whatsoever.

B.    "False alarm" includes the activation of a burglary and/or robbery alarm by other than a forced entry, attempted forced entry, unlawful entry, or actual robbery or attempted robbery, or a perceived threat to a person on the premises and at the time when no robbery, burglary or crime involving a foreseeable risk of grievous bodily harm is being committed or attempted on the premises.


9.76.030 Fees, corrective action, disconnection.

For police response to any false alarm, the City shall charge and collect from the person having or maintaining such burglary and/or robbery alarm on the premises owned or occupied by him the following fees:

A.    For a response to premises at which no other false alarm has occurred within the preceding six-month period, hereinafter referred to as a "first response," no fee shall be charged. Upon first response, notice of conditions and requirements of this chapter shall be given to the owner or occupant of the premises on which the false alarm occurred and upon which the burglary and/or robbery alarm is located.

B.    For a second response to premises within six months after the first response a fee, which shall be set by resolution, shall be charged. The person having or maintaining such burglary and/or robbery alarm shall, within five working days after notice to do so, make a written report to the chief of police on prescribed forms setting forth the cause of such false alarm, the corrective action taken, whether and when such alarm has been inspected by authorized service personnel, and such other information as the chief of police may reasonably require to determine the cause of such false alarm, any mitigating circumstances and corrective action necessary. The chief of police may direct the person having or maintaining such burglary and/or robbery alarm to have authorized personnel inspect the alarm at such premises and to take other corrective action as prescribed by the chief of police. All costs of inspection and corrective action shall be borne by the individual having or maintaining the alarm on said premises.

C.    For a third response to premises within six months after a second response, a fee, which shall be set by resolution, shall be charged, and if such third false alarm or any such succeeding false alarm occurs as a result of failure to take necessary corrective action prescribed under subsection B of this section, the chief of police may order the person having or maintaining the burglary and/or robbery alarm to disconnect such alarm until the prescribed corrective action is taken and certification of such corrective action is provided to the police department, provided that no disconnection shall be ordered relative to any premises required by law to have an alarm system in operation.

D.    For a fourth response to premises in six months after the third response, and for all succeeding responses within six months of the last response, a fee, which shall be set by resolution, shall be charged. The chief of police may also order disconnection as provided in subsection C of this section.


9.76.040 Administrative decisions, notice.

Notice of imposition of any administrative sanction, including the imposition of a fee or order of disconnection, under the provisions of this chapter, shall be given to the person having or maintaining a burglary and/or robbery alarm on the premises owned or occupied by him, provided that with respect to business premises, the owner, manager or chief administrative agent regularly assigned and employed on the premises at the time of the occurrence of a false alarm shall be presumed to be the person having or maintaining said alarm on said business premises.


9.76.050 Appeal from administrative decision, finality.

Any person subject to the imposition of a fee, order of disconnection, or other administrative sanction under the terms of this chapter shall have a right of appeal therefrom to the City hearing examiner. Unless notice of appeal is filed with the city clerk within 10 days of receipt of notice of imposition of an administrative sanction, said sanction is deemed to be final. (Ord. 626, 2000)

All references to the "Utility" in this chapter refer to the Stormwater Management Utility. The Utility will have primary authority and responsibility for carrying out the City’s comprehensive drainage and storm sewer plan, maintenance, administration, and operation of all City storm and surface water facilities, as well as establishing standards for design, construction, and maintenance of improvements on private property where these may affect storm and surface water and management.


11.04.020 Administrator of Utility.

The Mayor or his/her designee shall be the administrator of the Utility.


11.04.030 Ownership of City Stormwater Facilities and Assets.

Title and all other incidents of ownership of the following assets are vested in the Utility:

A.    All properties, interests, and physical and intangible rights of every nature owned or held by the City, however acquired, insofar as they relate to or concern storm or surface water runoff.

B.    All properties, interests and rights acquired by adverse possession or by prescription directly or through another in and to the drainage or storage, or both, of storm or surface waters, or both, through, under or over land, watercourses, sloughs, streams, ponds, lakes, and swamps. The properties, interests and rights so transferred shall begin from a point where storm or surface waters first enter the storm and surface water system of the City and shall end at a point where the storm or surface waters exit from the storm and surface water system of the City. The width of the properties, interests and rights so transferred shall be to the full extent of inundation caused by storm or flood conditions.

C.    All funds on deposit in the City Storm Drainage Fund and future revenues of said fund.


11.04.040 Definitions.

A.    “Developed parcel” means any parcel altered from the natural state by construction, creation, or addition of impervious surfaces.

B.    “Impervious surface” means a hard surface area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle as it entered under natural conditions prior to development, and/or a hard surface area which causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, roofs, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, areas which are paved, graveled or made of packed or oiled earthen materials, or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of surface and stormwater. Open, uncovered retention/detention facilities shall not be considered as impervious surfaces for the purpose of this chapter.

C.    “Maintenance” means the act or process of cleaning, repairing or preserving a system, unit, facility, structure or piece of equipment.

D.    “Open space” means any parcel, property, or portion thereof classified for current use taxation under the provisions of Chapter 84.34 RCW, or for which the development rights have been sold to the City of Lake Stevens.

E.    “Parcel” means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries and surface area which is documented for property tax purposes and given a tax number by the Snohomish County Assessor.

F.    “Equivalent service unit” means the average impervious surface area of single-family residential properties in the City.

G.    “Retention/detention facility” means a type of drainage facility designed either to hold water for a considerable length of time and then release it by evaporation, plant transpiration and/or infiltration into the ground or to hold runoff for a short period of time and then release it to the surface and stormwater management system.

H.    “Residence” means a building or structure, or portion thereof, designed for and used to provide a place of abode for human beings. The term “residence” includes the term “residential” or “residential unit” as referring to the type of or intended use of a building or structure.

I.    “Residential parcel” means any parcel which contains no more than two residences or two residential units which are within a single structure and are used primarily for residential purposes or any parcel which does not have impervious surfaces upon it.

J.    “Surface and stormwater utility services” means the services provided by the Stormwater Utility, including, but not limited to, stormwater management planning, facilities maintenance, regulation, financial administration, public involvement, drainage investigation and enforcement, aquatic resource restoration, surface and stormwater quality and environmental monitoring, natural surface water drainage system planning, intergovernmental relations, and facility design and construction.

K.    “Undeveloped parcel” means any parcel which has not been altered from its natural state by construction, creation or addition of impervious surfaces. (Ord. 1032, Sec. 1, 2018; Ord. 549, 1997)


11.04.050 Rates For Surface Water Drainage Service.

A.    Pursuant to and consistent with the “City of Lake Stevens Stormwater Rate Study Report” dated August 2018 which is adopted by this reference, the surface water utility rates and lake management benefit assessment for lakefront parcels to be paid to the City by the owners of developed land within the City of Lake Stevens are established as set forth in this chapter. The rate for stormwater services shall be charged whether the premises are occupied or vacant; provided the site contains impervious surface. An undeveloped parcel not containing impervious surface area will not be charged surface water utility rates. The service charge and lake management revenue needs of the program are based upon all or any part, as determined by the Council, of the cost of surface, stormwater, and lake management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such purpose.

1.    Single-Family Residential Units and Multifamily Residential Units with Five or Fewer Units. The average impervious area for a single-family residential unit is 3,000 square feet. This value is referred to as an equivalent service unit (ESU). The single-family residential unit charge shall be equivalent to one ESU and applied to each residential unit.

2.    All Other Customers, Including Commercial and Multifamily Residential with Six or More Units. The service charge for all classes other than single-family residences will be based on the number of ESUs. The actual measured impervious area of each individual site will be divided by 3,000 square feet to determine the number of ESUs of the individual site. The computed rate shall not be less than that for one ESU.

B.    The surface water utility rates and lake management charges for all parcels in the City shall be as set forth in the fee resolution.

C.    The City Council will review the surface water utility service charges annually to ensure the long-term fiscal viability of the program and to guarantee that debt covenants are met. The program will use equitable and efficient methods to determine service charges. (Ord. 1032, Sec. 2, 2018; Ord. 674, 2003; Ord. 617, 1999; Ord. 597; 1999; Ord. 549, 1997)


11.04.060 Billing.

A.    The charges imposed by this chapter shall be as stated in the fees resolution.

B.    The City will collect the stormwater utility fees through Snohomish County, or contract with another agency, or may elect to establish a monthly schedule.

1.    All parcels subject to charges of the utility shall be billed on the property characteristics existing on November 1st of the year prior to the billing year and at a rate set forth in this chapter. “Billing year” is the year that the bills are sent through the yearly property tax assessment with Snohomish County.

C.    Senior Citizen or Disabled Person Exemption. The following types of real property shall be presently exempt from the City’s stormwater rates and charges:

Real property that is owned by, and is the personal residence of, a person or persons approved by the County Assessor for a senior citizen or disabled persons property tax exemption under RCW 84.36.381. (Ord. 1032, Sec. 3, 2018; Ord. 971, Sec. 1, 2016; Ord. 674, 2003; Ord. 617, 1999; Ord. 597; 1999; Ord. 549, 1997)


11.04.070 Credits Allowed.1

A.    Any person billed for service charges may file a “Request for Rate Adjustment” with the Public Works Director (“Director”) or designee within two years of the date from which the bill was sent. However, filing of such a request does not extend the period for payment of the charge.

B.    Requests for rate adjustment may be granted or approved by the Director only when one of the following conditions exists:

1.    The parcel is owned and is the personal residence of a person or persons qualified as a low-income senior citizen or low-income disabled person under RCW 84.36.381;

2.    The actual impervious surface coverage of the parcel charged is in error;

3.    The parcel is nonresidential and the parcel meets the definition of open space as defined in this chapter. Parcels qualifying hereunder will be charged only for the area of impervious surface and at the rate which the parcel is classified under using the total parcel acreage;

4.    The parcel is owned or leased by a public school district which provides activities which directly benefit the City’s surface water utility. The activities may include: curriculum specific to the issues and problems of surface and stormwater management, and student activities in the community to expose students to the efforts required to restore, monitor or enhance the surface and stormwater management system. Pursuant to RCW 36.89.085, the amount of the rate adjustment shall be determined by the Director based upon the cost of the activities to the school district but not to exceed the value of the activity to the surface water utility. Determination of which activities qualify for the surface water utility service charge reduction will be made by the Director or designee. Reductions in surface water utility charges will only be granted to the school district if they provide programs that have been evaluated by the Director or designee. The rate adjustment for the school district activity may be applied to any parcel in the service area which is owned or operated by the school district; or

5.    The utility charge bill was otherwise not calculated in accordance with the terms of this chapter.

C.    The property owner shall have the burden of proving that the rate adjustment sought should be granted.

D.    Decisions on requests for rate adjustments shall be made by the Director based on information submitted by the applicant and by the Public Works Department within 30 days of the adjustment request except when additional information is needed. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the Director’s decision. If an adjustment is granted which reduces the charge for the current year or two prior years, the applicant shall be refunded the amount overpaid in the current and two prior years.

If the Director finds that a service charge bill has been undercharged, then either an amended bill shall be issued which reflects the increase in the utility charge or the undercharged amount will be added to the next year’s bill. This amended bill shall be due and payable as provided in RCW 36.89.090, 36.89.092 and 35.67.200, at the rate of 12 percent per annum, or such rate as may hereafter be authorized by law, computed on a monthly basis from the date of delinquency until paid. The Director may include in the bill the amount undercharged for two previous billing years in addition to the current bill. (Ord. 1032, Sec. 4, 2018; Ord. 971, Sec. 2, 2016)


11.04.090 Remedies.

In the event a customer or property owner shall fail to pay the surface water drainage service charge, the City shall have the authority to lien said property or customer. The use of a lien shall not limit other remedies available to the City under state law.


11.04.100 Appeals.

Any customer or property owner who feels that the surface water drainage service charge for their property has been incorrectly computed or applied, and/or that credits have not been properly granted may petition, in writing to the Director for a review of said computations, application or credit. If not satisfied with the determination of the Director, the petitioner may appeal to the City. Hearing Examiner as follows:

A.    An appeal is taken by filing with the City Clerk a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor.

B.    An appeal must be filed within 14 days after the date of the decision of the Director.

C.    The fee for filing such appeal shall be as stipulated in the current fee resolution for an appeal or variance hearing. If the appeal is determined to have merit, the cost of the appeal shall be refunded to the property owner filing the appeal.

D.    Whenever an appeal is filed, the City Clerk shall forthwith transmit to the Hearing Examiner all the papers constituting the record relating to the calculation of the service charge and the basis of the Director’s decision. The Hearing Examiner shall schedule and hold a closed appeal hearing within 60 days of the date of filing of the appeal, unless all parties to the appeal agree in writing to extend the time period.

E.    An appeal stays all collection actions by the utility unless the Director certifies to the Hearing Examiner that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the Hearing Examiner or a court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after notice to the Director.

F.    The Hearing Examiner may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the decision of the Director and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the Hearing Examiner shall have all the powers of the Director from whom the appeal is taken.

G.    An appeal decision by the Hearing Examiner is considered the final decision of the City.

H.    Any fees due shall then be paid within 30 days of the decision of the Hearing Examiner. Any credits authorized by the appeal process shall only be effective against billings subsequent to the date the appeal is filed.


11.04.110 Liens For Service/Interest.

Pursuant to RCW 35.67.200. the City shall have a lien for delinquent or unpaid surface water drainage service charges. Enforcement and foreclosure of said lien(s) shall be as provided by law.

(Ord. 1010, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 808, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


11.06.020 Authority.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to Chapter 35A.63 RCW (Planning and Zoning in Code Cities) and Chapter 36.70A RCW (Growth Management - Planning by Selected Counties and Cities) in compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act (Title 33 United States Code Section 1251 et seq.) and the requirements of the City’s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II permit issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology. Its provisions shall be implemented to accomplish the purposes of the NPDES program and to protect and preserve public health, safety and general welfare through implementation of the Stormwater Manual. (Ord. 1010, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018)


11.06.030 Stormwater Management Manual Adopted.

The 2012 Washington State Department of Ecology Storm Water Management Manual for Western Washington, as amended in 2014, as now or hereafter amended, is hereby adopted as the City’s minimum stormwater regulations and as a technical reference manual and is hereinafter referred to as the “Stormwater Manual.” (Ord. 1010, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 808, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009. Formerly 11.06.020)


11.06.040 Stormwater Management Review and Approval Required.

Stormwater management review and approval by the City are required when any development or proposed project meets or exceeds the threshold conditions defined in the Stormwater Manual (e.g., new and replaced hard area, drainage system modifications, redevelopments, etc.) and is subject to a City development permit or approval requirement. (Ord. 1010, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 808, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009. Formerly 11.06.030)


11.06.050 Standards, Definitions, and Requirements.

(a)    Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, all standards, definitions, and requirements shall be in accordance with the City’s Engineering Design and Development Standards (EDDS) and the Stormwater Manual.

(b)    Plan and Report Submittal. Stormwater site plans, supporting technical analyses and other required documentation shall conform to the requirements contained in the Stormwater Manual.

(c)    Where to Submit. All stormwater site plans prepared in connection with any of the permits and/or approvals set forth in this chapter shall be submitted to the Departments of Planning and Community Development and Public Works.

(d)    All plans, drawings and calculations designed to control surface water and subsurface water, submitted to the City, will be prepared by a licensed professional engineer, registered in the State of Washington, or by a person qualified as set forth in the Stormwater Manual, and those plans, drawings and calculations will be stamped showing that engineer’s registration, if applicable.

(e)    Interpretation. The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements in their interpretation and application and shall be liberally construed to serve the purposes of this chapter.

(f)    More Strict Standard Applies. When any provision of any other ordinance of the City’s regulations conflicts with this chapter, that which provides greater environmental protection shall apply unless otherwise provided for in this chapter.

11.06.060 Adjustments and Exceptions.

Adjustments and exceptions to the minimum standards and requirements may be granted as set forth in the Stormwater Manual. (Ord. 1010, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 808, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009. Formerly 11.06.050)


11.06.070 Low Impact Development - Application of Measures.

(a)    LID is a common stormwater management approach prescribed through the stormwater manual. The intent of LID as a stormwater approach is to mimic a site’s predevelopment hydrology by employing design techniques that infiltrate, store, evaporate and detain runoff close to its source. Applicability of methods is determined through a feasibility analysis according to the Stormwater Manual based on existing site conditions and limitations.

(b)    Low impact development is implemented by minimizing hard surface coverage and by managing runoff through dispersion, infiltration, evapotranspiration, or a combination of these approaches as directed by the Stormwater Manual.

(c)    A variety of best management practices (BMPs) to minimize hard surfaces and to manage stormwater have been developed and tested for use in Western Washington. Common LID techniques address stormwater control through using landscape and site features such as rain gardens, bioretention cells and permeable pavements as directed by the Stormwater Manual. These BMPs and the overall LID approach are described in the LID Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound (LID Manual). (Ord. 1010, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 808, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009. Formerly 11.06.060)


11.06.080 Construction and Maintenance of Stormwater Facilities.

(a)    All stormwater facilities required under this chapter shall be constructed and maintained as set forth in the Stormwater Manual and the permits and/or approvals of the City.

(b)    Maintenance of Private Stormwater Facilities.

(1)    The person or persons holding title to the property and the applicant required to construct a stormwater facility shall remain responsible for the facility’s continual performance, operation, and maintenance in accordance with the standards and requirements of the Stormwater Manual, this chapter, and the permits and/or approvals of the City and shall remain responsible for any liability as a result of these duties. This requirement shall apply to all facilities not otherwise accepted by the City for maintenance as set forth in subsection (c) of this section.

(2)    The City shall have authority to periodically enter upon the property and inspect the facilities to ensure such compliance and to issue orders requiring maintenance and/or repair. In event that the titleholders or other responsible parties do not effect such maintenance and/or repairs, the City may perform such work, and the cost thereof shall be recoverable by the City from said titleholders or other responsible parties and/or by filing a lien against the property.

(3)    When an inspection identifies an exceedance of the maintenance standard, maintenance shall be performed in accordance with the following schedule:

(i)    Within one year for typical maintenance of facilities, except catch basins.

(ii)    Within six months for catch basins.

(iii)    Within two years for maintenance that requires capital construction of less than $25,000.

(c)    Maintenance by City of Stormwater Facilities on Single-Family Residential Property.

(1)    The City is authorized to assume the total responsibility for all maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities serving single-family residential property if:

In the event that any other tenant’s activities interfere with the Lessee’s use of the City property, and the Lessee cannot work out this interference with the other tenants, the Lessee may, upon 30 days notice to the City, terminate this lease and restore the City property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The Lessee shall cooperate with all other tenants to identify the causes of and work towards the resolution of any electronic interference problem. In addition, the Lessee agrees to eliminate any radio or television interference caused to City-owned facilities or surrounding residences at Lessee’s own expense.

12.12.0580 Cancellation of Lease by Lessee.

B.    In the event that the holder of a Facilities Lease determines that the City property is unsuitable for its intended purpose, the Lessee shall have the right to cancel the lease upon 120 days written notice to the City. However, no prepaid rent shall be refundable.


12.12.0590 Compensation to the City.

Each Facilities Lease granted under this Article is subject to the City’s right, which is expressly reserved, to annually fix a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid for the rights granted to the lessee; provided, nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the City and a lessee from agreeing to the compensation to be paid.

12.12.0640 Purpose.

The purpose of this Article is to set forth certain terms and conditions which are common to all Telecommunications Right-of-Way Use Authorizations, Telecommunications Franchises, and Facilities Leases. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter or in such an authorization, franchise, or lease, the provisions of this Article apply to all such authorizations, franchises, and leases approved or granted by the City.


12.12.0650 Acceptance.

No authorization, franchise, or lease granted pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall become effective unless and until the ordinance or other City action granting the same has become effective. Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance or other City action granting an authorization, franchise, or lease, or within such extended period of time as the Council in its discretion may authorize, the applicant shall file with the Mayor or designee an unconditional written acceptance of the authorization, franchise, or lease, in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, together with the bonds, insurance policies, and security fund required by this Article.


12.12.0660 Police Power.

In accepting any authorization, franchise or lease, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the legitimate rights of the police power of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the public, and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the City pursuant to such power.


12.12.0670 Rules and Regulations by the City.

In addition to the inherent powers of the City to regulate and control any authorization, franchise, or lease it issues, the authority granted to it by the Cable Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and those powers expressly reserved by the City, or agreed to and provided for in any authorization, franchise, or lease, the right and power is hereby reserved by the City to promulgate such additional regulations as it may find necessary in the exercise of its lawful powers giving due regard to the rights of grantees, franchisees, and lessees. Except as provided in this Chapter, the foregoing does not allow for amendment by the City of material terms of any authorization, franchise, or lease it issues without the consent of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee. The City reserves the right to delegate its authority for authorization, franchise, and lease administration to a designated agent.


12.12.0680 Location of Facilities.

All facilities shall be constructed, installed, and located in accordance with the following terms and conditions, unless otherwise specified in an authorization, franchise, or lease agreement.

A.    Unless otherwise provided in an authorization, franchise, or lease, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee with permission to occupy a public way must locate its cable or telecommunications facilities underground.

B.    Whenever any new or existing electric utilities, cable facilities, or telecommunications facilities are located or relocated underground within a public way of the City, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee that currently occupies the same public way shall relocate its facilities underground at no expense to the City. Absent extraordinary circumstances or undue hardship as determined by the City Public Works Director, such relocation shall be made concurrently to minimize the disruption of the public ways. No extension granted by the Director of Public Works under this Subsection shall exceed a period of 12 months.

C.    Whenever new cable or telecommunications facilities will exhaust the capacity of a public street or utility easement to reasonably accommodate future cable or telecommunications carriers or facilities, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee and all other occupants of the public way shall provide additional ducts, conduits, manholes, and other facilities for nondiscriminatory access to future operators and carriers at their own expense.


12.12.0690 Compliance with One Number Locator Service.

All grantees, franchisees, and lessees shall, before commencing any construction in the public ways, comply with all regulations of Chapter 19.122 RCW, the One Number Locator Service.


12.12.0700 Construction Permits.

All grantees, franchisees, and lessees are required to obtain Construction Permits for cable and telecommunications facilities as required in Article VI of this Chapter. However, nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the City and a grantee, franchisee, or lessee from agreeing to alternative plan review, permit, and construction procedures for an authorization, franchise, or lease granted under this Chapter, provided such alternative procedures provide substantially equivalent safeguards for responsible construction practices.


12.12.0710 Interference with the Public Ways.

No grantee, franchisee, or lessee may locate or maintain its cable or telecommunications facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public ways by the City, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the public ways. All such facilities shall be moved by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, at the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s cost, temporarily or permanently, as determined by the City Public Works Director.


12.12.0720 Damage to Property.

No grantee, franchisee, or lessee, nor any person acting on a grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s behalf shall take any action or permit any action to be done which may impair or damage any City property, public ways of the City, other ways or other property, whether publicly or privately owned, located in, on or adjacent thereto.


12.12.0730 Notice of Work.

Unless otherwise provided in an authorization, franchise, or lease agreement, no grantee, franchisee, or lessee, nor any person acting on the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s behalf, shall commence any non-emergency work in or about the public ways of the City, other ways, or upon City property without 10 working days advance notice to the City.


12.12.0740 Repair and Emergency Work.

In the event of an unexpected repair or emergency, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee may commence such repair and emergency response work as required under the circumstances, provided the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall notify the City as promptly as possible, before such repair or emergency work commences or as soon thereafter as possible if advance notice is not practicable.


12.12.0750 Maintenance of Facilities.

Each grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall maintain its facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state and local requirements.


12.12.0760 Relocation or Removal of Facilities.

Within 30 days following written notice from the City, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change, or alter the position of any cable or telecommunications facilities within the public ways or upon City property whenever the City Public Works Director shall have determined that such removal, relocation, change, or alteration is reasonably necessary for:

A.    The construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any City or other public improvement in or upon the public ways; and

B.    The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon the public ways.


12.12.0770 Building Moving.

Whenever any person shall have obtained permission from the City to use any street or public way for the purpose of moving any building, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee, upon 7 days written notice from the City, shall raise or remove, at the expense of the person desiring to move the building, any of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s facilities which may obstruct the removal of such building; provided, that the person desiring to move the building shall comply with all requirements of the City for the movement of buildings.


12.12.0780 Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.

Within 90 days following written notice from the City, any telecommunications carrier or provider or other person who owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized cable or telecommunications system, facility, or related appurtenances within the public ways of the City shall, at its own expense, remove such facilities or appurtenances from the public ways of the City. A cable or telecommunications system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:

A.    Upon expiration or termination of the grantee or franchisee’s authorization or franchise;

B.    Upon abandonment of a facility within the public ways of the City. Any property of a grantee or franchisee shall be deemed abandoned if left in place 90 days after expiration or termination of an authorization or franchise;

C.    If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of an authorization or franchise;

D.    If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior issuance of a required Construction Permit; or

E.    If the system or facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the authorization or franchise.

Provided, however, that the City may, in its sole discretion, allow a grantee, franchisee, or other such persons who may own, control, or maintain cable or telecommunications facilities within the public ways of the City to abandon such facilities in place. No facilities of any type may be abandoned in place without the express written consent of the City. Any plan for abandonment or removal of a grantee or franchisee’s facilities must be first approved by the Public Works Director, and all necessary permits must be obtained prior to such work. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of such persons in place, the property shall become that of the City, and such persons shall submit to the City an instrument in writing, to be approved by the City Attorney, transferring to the City the ownership of such property. The provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration, revocation, or termination of an authorization or franchise granted under this Chapter.


12.12.0790 Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities.

The City retains the right and privilege to cut or move any cable or telecommunications facilities located within the public ways of the City and upon City property, as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. The City shall not be liable to any cable operator, telecommunications carrier or provider, or any other party for any direct, indirect, or any other such damages suffered by any person or entity of any type as a direct or indirect result of the City’s actions under this Section.


12.12.0800 Damage to Facilities.

Unless directly and proximately caused by the willful, intentional, or malicious acts by the City, the City shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any cable or telecommunications facility upon City property or within the public ways of the City as a result of or in connection with any public works, public improvements, construction, excavation, grading, filling, or work of any kind on such City property or within the public ways by or on behalf of the City.


12.12.0810 Restoration of Public Ways, Other Ways, and City Property.

A.    When a grantee, franchisee, lessee, or any person acting on its behalf, does any work in or affecting any public ways, other ways or City property, it shall, at its own expense, promptly remove any obstructions therefrom and restore such ways or property to as good a condition as existed before the work was undertaken, unless otherwise directed by the City.

B.    If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete restoration required by this Section, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall temporarily restore the affected ways or property. Such temporary restoration shall be at the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s sole expense and the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration.

C.    A grantee, franchisee, lessee or other person acting in its behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flaggers, lights, flares, and other measures as required for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle, or property by reason of such work in or affecting such ways or property.

D.    The Public Works Director shall be responsible for inspection and final approval of the condition of the public ways, other ways, and City property following any construction and restoration activities therein. Further, the provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration, revocation, or termination of an authorization, franchise, lease, or other agreement granted pursuant to this Chapter.


12.12.0820 Facilities Maps.

Each grantee, franchisee, and lessee shall provide the City with a map or maps accurately reflecting the horizontal and vertical location and configuration of all of their telecommunications facilities within the public ways and upon City property. Each grantee, franchisee, and lessee shall provide the City with updated maps annually or upon request by the City. Maps shall be provided in hard copy and electronic (“*.dxf” or compatible) format.


12.12.0830 Duty to Provide Information.

Within 10 days of a written request from the City, each grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall furnish the City with information sufficient to demonstrate:

A.    That the grantee, franchisee, or lessee has complied with all requirements of this Chapter; and

B.    That all sales, utility and/or telecommunications taxes due the City in connection with the cable or telecommunications services and facilities provided by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee have been properly collected and paid by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee.

All books, records, maps and other documents, maintained by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee with respect to its facilities within the public ways and upon City property shall be made available for inspection by the City at reasonable times and intervals; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to require a grantee, franchisee, or lessee to violate state or federal law regarding subscriber privacy, nor shall this Section be construed to require a grantee, franchisee, or lessee to disclose proprietary or confidential information without adequate safeguards for its confidential or proprietary nature.


12.12.0840 Leased Capacity.

A grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall have the right, without prior City approval, to offer or provide capacity or bandwidth to its customers consistent with such permit, franchise, or lease; provided:

12.12.0860 General Indemnification.

No authorization, franchise, or lease shall be deemed to be granted under this Chapter unless it includes an indemnity clause substantially conforming to the following:

The grantee, franchisee, or lessee hereby releases, covenants not to bring suit and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, volunteers, engineers, and consultants from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person, including claims by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s own employees to which the grantee, franchisee, or lessee might otherwise be immune under Title 51 RCW, arising from injury or death of any person or damage to property of which the negligent acts or omissions of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, its agents, servants, officers, or employees in performing under this authorization, franchise, or lease are the proximate cause. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee further releases, covenants not to bring suit and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, engineers, and consultants from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person including claims by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s own employees, including those claims to which the grantee, franchisee, or lessee might otherwise have immunity under Title 51 RCW, arising against the City solely by virtue of the City’s ownership or control of the rights-of-way or other public properties, by virtue of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s exercise of the rights granted herein, or by virtue of the City’s permitting the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s use of the City’s rights-of-way or other public property, based upon the City’s inspection or lack of inspection of work performed by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, its agents and servants, officers or employees in connection with work authorized on the City’s property or property over which the City has control, pursuant to this authorization, franchise, or lease, or pursuant to any other permit or approval issued in connection with this authorization, franchise, or lease. This covenant of indemnification shall include, but not be limited by this reference, claims against the City arising as a result of the negligent acts or omissions of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, its agents, servants, officers, or employees in barricading, instituting trench safety systems or providing other adequate warnings of any excavation, construction, or work in any public right-of-way or other public place in performance of work or services permitted under this authorization, franchise, or lease.

Inspection or acceptance by the City of any work performed by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. Said indemnification obligations shall extend to claims which are not reduced to a suit and any claims which may be compromised prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation.

In the event that the grantee, franchisee, or lessee refuses the tender of defense in any suit or any claim, said tender having been made pursuant to the indemnification clauses contained herein, and said refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such other tribunal that the parties shall agree to decide the matter), to have been a wrongful refusal on the part of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, then the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall pay all of the City’s costs for defense of the action, including all reasonable expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees and the reasonable costs of the City, including reasonable attorneys’ fees of recovering under this indemnification clause.

In the event of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damages to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, and the City, its officers, employees and agents, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s liability hereunder shall be only to the extent of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s negligence. It is further specifically and expressly understood that the indemnification provided herein constitutes the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s waiver of immunity under Title 51 RCW, solely for the purposes of this indemnification. This waiver has been mutually negotiated by the parties.

The provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this authorization, franchise, or lease agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee assumes the risk of damage to its facilities located in the City’s public ways, rights-of-way, easements, and property from activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees, and contractors. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee releases and waives any and all claims against the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors for damage to or destruction of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees, and contractors, in the public ways, rights-of-way, easements, or property subject to this authorization, franchise, or lease, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from the sole negligence or any willful or malicious action on the part of the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee further agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City against any claims for damages, including, but not limited to, business interruption damages and lost profits, brought by or under users of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s facilities as the result of any interruption of service due to damage or destruction of the user’s facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from the sole negligence or any willful or malicious actions on the part of the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors.

A.    The fund shall serve as security for the full and complete performance of this Chapter, including any costs, expenses, damages, or loss the City pays or incurs, including civil penalties, because of any failure attributable to the grantee, franchisee, or lessee to comply with the codes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or permits of the City.

Said bond shall be required to remain in full force until 60 days after completion of the construction and/or improvements within the public ways of the City or upon City-owned property, and shall warrant all such restoration work for a period of 1 year.

In the event that the City adopts a resolution or other appropriate order denying its consent and such change, transfer or acquisition of control has been effected, the City may cancel the authorization, franchise, or lease. Approval shall not be required for mortgaging purposes or if said transfer is from a grantee, franchisee, or lessee to another person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee, franchisee, or lessee.

14.04.010 Short Title.

This title shall be known and may be cited as the Lake Stevens Land Use Ordinance. (Ord. 468, 1995)


14.04.014 Purpose and Intent.

(a)    The purpose of the Land Use Code is to create a livable and sustainable city by establishing standards, procedures, and minimum requirements to achieve the following general intentions and purposes for the City of Lake Stevens:

(1)    To establish regulatory procedures and standards for review and decision-making of all proposed development in the City.

(2)    To foster and preserve public health, safety, comfort, and welfare, and to aid in the harmonious, orderly, aesthetically pleasing, and socially beneficial development of the City, in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.

(3)    To adopt a development review process that is:

(i)    Efficient, in terms of time and expense;

(ii)    Effective, in terms of addressing the natural, historic, and aesthetic resources and public facility implications of any proposed development, while also protecting and improving the quality of life in the City; and

(iii)    Equitable, in terms of consistency with established regulations and procedures, respect for the rights of all property owners, and consideration of the interests of the citizens and residents of the City.

(4)    To prohibit or condition incompatible land uses or certain aspects of land uses by regulating density and dimensional aspects of development, ensuring that new development(s) install all private and public infrastructure necessary to serve said new development and protecting critical areas.

(5)    To implement the Comprehensive Plan of the City by:

(i)    Establishing regulations and conditions governing the erection and use of buildings and other structures and the uses of land planned for the future as specified in the Comprehensive Plan;

(ii)    Securing safety from fire, panic, and other dangers;

(iii)    Lessening automobile congestion of the streets;

(iv)    Providing for adequate light and air;

(v)    Preventing the overcrowding of land;

(vi)    Avoiding undue congestion of population and facilitating the adequate provision of transportation, potable water, wastewater disposal, schools, parks, and other public requirements of the City;

(vii)    Dividing the City into zoning districts, defining certain terms, designating the uses and intensities thereof that are permitted in the different districts, and providing lot size and other density and dimensional requirements;

(viii)    Establishing performance standards that apply to all new development as well as the redevelopment of all lands in the City;

(ix)    Defining the functions of the Planning Department, Public Works Department, Hearing Examiner, Design Review Board, Planning Commission, and City Council and other relevant agencies with respect to the administration and enforcement of this Land Use Code.

(6)    To regulate the subdivision of land to:

(i)    Ensure that adequate drainage facilities are provided in developing portions of the City;

(ii)    Promote coordinated land development; and

(iii)    Require uniform monumenting of land subdivisions and conveyance by accurate legal description.

(7)    To be consistent with the City of Lake Stevens’ Comprehensive Plan by ensuring that all development in the City will be served by adequate public facilities.

(8)    To require that all new land development activity contribute its proportionate share of the funds, land, and/or public facilities necessary to accommodate the impacts that such new development has on public facilities and services having a rational nexus to the proposed development and for which the need is reasonably attributable to the proposed development.

(9)    To provide for a penalty for the violation of this Land Use Code.

(b)    The zoning districts established in Chapter 14.36 are designated based on there being adequate public infrastructure and facilities provided at the time that the individual properties within that district are developed and/or used in a manner consistent with the uses allowed in that zoning district. Adequate public infrastructure and facilities are defined as being built to their planned capacity since the planned capacity is based on anticipated population at build-out under those zoning districts. (Ord. 811, Sec. 11, 2010; Ord. 741, Sec. 3, 2007; Ord. 501, Sec. 1, 1995)


14.04.020 Authority.

(a)    This title is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in Chapter 35A.63 RCW (Planning and Zoning in Code Cities), Chapter 35A.58 RCW (Boundaries and Plats), Chapter 36.70A RCW (Growth Management - Planning by Selected Counties and Cities), Chapter 86.16 RCW (Flood Management), RCW Title 58 (Boundaries and Plats), and any other appropriate State regulations.

(b)    Whenever any provision of this title refers to or cites a section of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) or Washington Administrative Code (WAC) and that section is later amended or superseded, the title shall be deemed amended to refer to the amended section or the section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section. (Ord. 811, Sec. 12, 2010)


14.04.030 Jurisdiction.

(a)    This title shall be effective throughout the City’s planning jurisdiction. The City’s planning jurisdiction comprises the area within the corporate boundaries of the City, and as extended per subsection (b) of this section.

(b)    The City of Lake Stevens and Snohomish County may enter into an interlocal agreement granting partial or full planning jurisdiction to the City within any or all portions of the Lake Stevens Urban Growth Area (as established in both jurisdictions’ comprehensive plans).

The provisions in this title were originally adopted on April 17, 1995, and became effective on May 1, 1995.


14.04.050 Relationship to Existing Zoning, Subdivision and Flood Control Ordinances.

To the extent that the provisions of this title are the same in substance as the previously adopted provisions that they replace in the City’s zoning, subdivision, streets and sidewalks, parking, landscaping, flood control, building and construction, sign, shoreline management, drainage, sewer, or fee ordinances and/or titles, they shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments unless otherwise specifically provided. In particular, a situation that did not constitute a lawful nonconforming situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this title merely by the repeal of the zoning ordinance.


14.04.060 Relationship to Land Use Plan.

It is the intention of the Council that this title implement the planning policies adopted by the Council for the City and its urban growth area, as reflected in the Comprehensive Plan and other planning documents.

(b)    Fees established in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be paid upon submission of a signed application or notice of appeal, or as otherwise provided by said fee resolution. (Ord. 821, Sec. 3, 2009; Ord. 811, Sec. 13, 2010)


14.04.090 Severability.

It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this title are severable, and if any such section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this title since the same would have been enacted without the incorporation into this title of such unconstitutional or invalid section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase.


14.04.100 Computation of Time.

(a)    Unless otherwise specifically provided, the time within which an act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, that day shall be excluded.

(b)    Unless otherwise specifically provided, whenever a person has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period.


14.04.110 Miscellaneous.

(a)    As used in this title, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine and neuter.

(b)    Words used in the singular in this title include the plural and words used in the plural include the singular.

In the consistency review, the City shall consider the following factors:

(1)    The type of land use permitted;

(2)    The level of development, such as units per acre or other measures of density;

(3)    Infrastructure, including public facilities and services needed to serve the development; and

(4)    The characteristics of the development, such as development standards.

14.16A.010 Purpose and Applicability.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for processing project permit applications and for adopting and amending Comprehensive Plans and development regulations. These procedures are intended to promote land use decisions that further the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.020 Delegation of Authority.

Wherever this title refers to any of the following agents or any other agents of authority in the City, such agent may delegate the agent’s authority in the implementation of this title to another competent agent acting in the agent’s behalf. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.030 Planning Agency Identified.

(b)    The Building Official;

(c)    The Director of the Department of Public Works;

(d)    Repealed by Ord. 1068.

(e)    The Lake Stevens Hearing Examiner;

(f)    The Lake Stevens Planning Commission;

(g)    The Lake Stevens Park Board; and

(h)    The Lake Stevens City Council. (Ord. 1068, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.040 Compliance with Title 14 Required.

(a)    All land uses, activities, construction, clearing, grading, filling, development, intensification, and structural modifications or alterations shall comply with this title and with all permits and approvals granted for the use, activity, construction, clearing, grading, filling, development, intensification, or structural modifications or alterations. No permit or approval shall be issued for any parcel of land developed or divided in violation of this title.

(b)    All divisions of land shall comply with this title. Any portion of a lot or lots that was used to calculate compliance with this title, standards, or regulations shall not be subsequently subdivided or segregated from such lot or lots or sold or transferred separately from such lot or lots.

(c)    Violations and Penalties.

(1)    Any person violating any provisions of this title shall be subject to Title 17, Enforcement Code, and Chapter 14.28, Enforcement and Review.

(2)    Any building, structure, development, activity, land use, or division of land, not in conformance with this title and not a legal nonconformance or exempted by a policy governing existing nonconforming structures or uses, is declared to be unlawful, substandard, and a public nuisance, and is subject to the enforcement and abatement provisions in Title 17, Enforcement Code, and Chapter 14.28, Enforcement and Review.

Actual commencement of the approved land use may not occur until all requirements of the permit have been satisfied.

(b)    Transfer of Permit and Permit Applications on Successors and Assigns. Active land use permits and pending land use permit applications, including subdivisions, run with the land and therefore are transferable to new owners.

(c)    Reapplication Following Denial of Permit. Whenever a land use permit or a variance is denied, such action may not be reconsidered for a period of one year from the date of denial unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:

(1)    The zoning classification or relevant development standards have changed;

(2)    New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented at a previous hearing; or

(3)    The project is modified in such a manner so as to correct the defects on which the original denial was based. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)

(6)    Any other information relevant to the matter.

(7)    Certification of publication, and a copy of the mailed notification and the date of mailing.

(b)    The official file is a public record. It is available for inspection and copying in the Planning Department during regular business hours, though availability may be temporarily restricted during or prior to public hearings while staff is preparing for the hearing.

(c)    Official files shall be kept pursuant to State retention requirements. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)

Decision criteria for specific permits are outlined in Chapter 14.16C. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.120 Environmental Review.

Environmental review is conducted pursuant to Title 16, SEPA Procedures and Policies. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.130 Construction Plan Review.

(a)    The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for reviewing site construction plans for site improvements. Site construction drawings are engineering documents that are required for improvements to a particular site.

(b)    Public Works Construction Plan Approval.

(1)    Upon receipt of approval of a land use permit or preliminary subdivision, the applicant is required to apply for construction plan approval relating to following elements: on-site and off-site stormwater management, erosion control measures, public road and frontage improvements, dedication or deeding of right-of-way, street trees and other required landscaping elements, utilities, and any other improvement related to the development.

(2)    The application for construction plan approval shall include a completed construction plan review application form, plans and materials as outlined in the construction plan submittal checklist, and fee as set by Council resolution.

(3)    The applicant is required to obtain approvals from the Postmaster and utility purveyors.

(4)    Following approval of the construction plans and prior to any site work, the applicant shall schedule a preconstruction meeting with the Public Works Department. All contractors, subcontractors and utility representatives are to meet to discuss any issues related to the construction activity and minimizing impacts to the neighborhood and nearby facilities.

(5)    Pursuant to Section 14.16A.180(b), the Public Works Director may require a performance security to be in place before construction activities are commenced.

(c)    Public Improvements Required before Occupancy or Final Plat. Final plat approval or certificate of occupancy shall not be granted unless the required public improvements have been installed and accepted by the Public Works Department or the subdivider has provided a completion security pursuant to Section 14.16A.180(c) to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within not more than 12 months after final plat approval or until half of the dwelling units within the plat or phase are issued building permits, whichever comes first. Replacement trees to be located on public property must be planted prior to final plat approval. Replacement trees to be located on a private lot must be installed prior to issuing a final inspection or certificate of occupancy for that lot.

(d)    Dedication of Public Stormwater Facilities. Stormwater facilities shall be dedicated to the City at the completion of development. Private and commercial stormwater facilities remain the responsibility of the property owner(s).

(e)    Maintenance of Dedicated Facilities until Acceptance. Facilities intended to be dedicated to the City shall be maintained by the owner until such time as the dedication is accepted by the City.

(f)    Protection against Defects.

(1)    Whenever public improvements are to be dedicated to the City, the developer shall post a maintenance bond or other sufficient surety pursuant to Section 14.16A.180(d) to guarantee that the developer will correct all defects in such facilities or improvements that occur within two years after the acceptance of dedication of the improvements.

(2)    An architect or engineer retained by the developer shall certify to the City that all facilities and improvements to be dedicated to the City have been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. This certification shall be a condition precedent to acceptance by the City of the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements.

(3)    For purposes of this section, the term “defects” refers to any condition that requires repairs over and above the normal amount of maintenance required for a particular improvement.

(g)    Authorizing Use and/or Occupancy before Completion of Development under Land Use Permits. When weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the permittee (exclusive of financial hardship) make it unreasonable for the permittee to comply with all of the requirements of the permit (exclusive of subdivision approvals), the Planning Director may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings, if the permit recipient provides a performance bond or other security to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed 12 months) and if the Building Official finds that such occupancy will not result in a safety or health hazard. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 903, Sec. 7, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.140 Building and Construction Permit Review.

Procedures and requirements for administering and enforcing building and construction codes are set forth in Chapter 14.80. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.150 Phasing Development.

(a)    Projects may be completed in phases, provided the phasing meets the requirements of this section.

(b)    The developer shall submit site plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this title that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage.

(c)    Each phase must stand on its own in terms of meeting the requirements of the permit and this title. For example, improvements necessary to support Phase 1 cannot be deferred to be constructed at Phase 2.

(d)    The circulation pattern at the end of each phase must result in a configuration that does not create traffic hazards and that adequately supports the level of traffic anticipated to be generated. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.160 Post-Annexation Processing of Building and Related Permits and Land Use Applications.

(a)    The purpose of this section is to clearly state the process for processing of permits in newly annexed areas consistent with any adopted interlocal agreements.

(b)    The City will honor subdivisions, short plats, and other projects that have already vested under Snohomish County development standards pursuant to this section.

(c)    The County will continue the building permit review and project inspections of vested active projects and active land use permits pursuant to any adopted annexation interlocal agreement.

(d)    After the effective date of an annexation, all new land use and building applications shall conform to City regulations, and all plan reviews and inspections will be conducted by the City.

(e)    Transfer by Request of an Applicant. An applicant may request a transfer of a pending building permit application from the County to the City by submitting a written request to the City. The City will recognize any intermediate approvals that are effective prior to transfer of the permit application.

(f)    Permit Renewal or Extension. After the effective date of annexation, any request to renew a building permit or to renew or extend a land use permit issued by the County in the annexation area shall be made to and administered by the City pursuant to Section 14.16A.250.

(g)    Applicant-Requested Change to County Vested Project or County Approved Land Use Permit. Once permit processing has been transferred to the City pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of this section, or a permit has been approved by the County pursuant to an adopted annexation interlocal agreement, an applicant may request a change to a permit from the City in compliance with the requirements in Section 14.16A.235. Administrative modifications will be pursuant to County code; all other modifications will be pursuant to City code.

(h)    Expiration of County Vested Permits. The vested status of permits in an annexation area which vested in the County before the effective date of the annexation shall expire pursuant to the County code. If the County code does not specifically address expiration, then Section 14.16A.250 shall govern expiration of vested status. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.170 Engineering Design and Development Standards.

(a)    The Engineering Design and Development Standards, cited routinely as the EDDS, shall govern all new construction and upgrading of transportation facilities, storm drainage facilities and utilities within City rights-of-way, whether occurring under permit or franchise, and other transportation-related improvements mandated by the City’s Land Use Code.

(b)    Work and materials installed in the existing or future rights-of-way shall conform to the currently adopted version of the EDDS.

(c)    The EDDS may be amended or revised by the City Engineer in accordance with the policies in this title and sound engineering practices. A copy of any such amendment or revision shall be filed with the City Clerk and shall be subject to a 10-day public comment period. Copies of the EDDS amendments or revisions may be secured from the Department of Public Works at appropriate fees in accordance with copying charges established by the City Council.

(d)    The City Engineer may adopt and incorporate into the EDDS, by reference, other Federal, State and local design standards and specifications and other professionally accepted engineering standards and specifications.

(e)    The currently adopted version of the Engineering Design and Development Standards shall be available in the City Clerk’s office and the Public Works Department. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.180 Security Mechanisms.

(a)    General Requirements.

(1)    As security the City may accept any of the following: bonds, letters of credit from an insured bank, a secured account with an insured bank, or a cash deposit. Other forms of security may be accepted if approved by the City Finance Director in consultation with the City Attorney.

(2)    In each case where the City requires or allows an applicant to post a security, the Public Works Director shall determine the type of security to be used.

(b)    Performance Securities.

(1)    Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, a performance security shall be required for any project on a site greater than one acre in size to guarantee that a site can be closed and/or winterized if necessary, or that measures can be taken by the City to respond to weather-related emergencies.

(2)    In addition, an augmented performance security may be required by the Public Works Director to cover the cost of installing any system-wide public improvements that an applicant has agreed to install as part of his project where the lack of installation would cause the system to fail or not be completed in a timely manner.

(3)    Performance securities may be presented to the City after preliminary approval of a project but in all circumstances shall be presented prior to any site work, including clearing, grading, or construction.

(4)    Submission of a performance security may be waived by the Public Works Director if, in his opinion, said guarantee of installation is not necessary.

(c)    Completion Securities. In lieu of installing public improvements per this title or a condition of a permit, a developer may propose to post a security to ensure completion of the improvements within one year of permit approval. An extension not to exceed one year may be approved by the Public Works Director upon extension of the security or submission of a new one.

(d)    Maintenance Securities. Any developer shall provide to the City a maintenance security to cover the cost of replacing or repairing any of the public improvements installed per this title or a condition of a permit.

(e)    Amount of the Security.

(1)    The amount of a security shall be a percentage, as specified in this subsection, of the estimated cost of design, materials, and labor, based on the estimated costs on the last day covered by the device, of installing, replacing, or repairing (whichever is appropriate) the improvements covered by the security.

(i)    Performance. One hundred fifty percent of the costs specified in subsection (e)(1) of this section.

(ii)    Completion. One hundred fifty percent of the costs specified in subsection (e)(1) of this section.

(iii)    Maintenance. Twenty percent of the costs specified in subsection (e)(1) of this section.

(2)    The Public Works Director shall approve the amount of a security under subsection (a) of this section. The applicant shall prepare for the Public Works Director’s review and approval a cost estimate of the items to be covered by the security.

(f)    Reduction of Securities. In those cases where improvement securities have been made, the amount of the guarantee may be reduced upon acceptance of the dedication of a portion of the required improvements. The amount of the reduction shall not exceed the percentage which the improvements just accepted for dedication made up of all originally required improvements. In no case, however, shall the guarantee be reduced to less than 15 percent of the original amount.

(g)    Duration of Securities. All securities shall be held until released by the Public Works Director; however, the standard duration of the various securities should be as follows:

(1)    Performance. One year or until all improvements are installed and accepted by the City, whichever is greater.

(2)    Completion. One year or until all improvements are installed and accepted by the City, whichever is greater.

(3)    Maintenance. Two years; extendable by the City if repairs are made at the end of the bonding period which, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, require additional guarantee of workmanship.

(h)    Supplemental Administrative Costs. In addition to the security, the applicant shall pay a fee to the City covering the City’s actual expenses of administering, and if necessary, using the proceeds of the security. The amount of this fee will be set by resolution.

(i)    Security Agreement. In each case where a security is posted, the applicant and the Public Works Director shall sign a notarized security agreement, approved in form by the City Attorney. This agreement shall be recorded with the Snohomish County Auditor. The agreement shall provide the following information:

(1)    A description of the work or improvements covered by the security.

(2)    Either the period of time covered by the maintenance security or the date after which the City will use the proceeds of the performance security to complete the required work or improvements.

(3)    The amount and nature of the security and the amount of the cash deposit.

(4)    The rights and duties of the City and the applicant.

(5)    An irrevocable license to run with the property to allow the employees, agents, or contractors of the City to go on the subject property for the purpose of inspecting and, if necessary, doing the work or making the improvements covered by the security.

(6)    The mechanism by and circumstances under which the security shall be released. At a minimum, after the work or improvements covered by a performance security have been completed, or at the end of the time covered by a maintenance security, the applicant may request the City to release the security. If the applicant has complied with the security agreement and this Code, the Public Works Director shall release the security remaining. If the work has not been completed or repairs not made, then the City shall not release the security until such work is completed per subsection (j) of this section. Partial release of the security may be allowed; provided, that the developer provides a new security in the amount specified in subsection (e) of this section for the remaining work.

(7)    Upon release of any recorded security mechanism, a copy of the letter of release shall be filed with the Snohomish County Auditor.

(j)    Use of Security Funds by the City.

(1)    If during the period of time covered by a maintenance security, or after the date by which the required work or improvements are to be completed under a performance security, the Public Works Director determines that the security agreement has not been complied with, he shall notify the applicant of this. The notice must state:

(i)    The work that must be done or the improvements that must be made to comply with the security agreement; and

(ii)    The amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, that the applicant has to commence and complete the required work or improvements; and

(iii)    That, if the work or improvements are not commenced and completed within the time specified, the City will use the proceeds of the security to have the required work or improvements completed.

(2)    If the work or improvements covered by the security are not completed within the time specified in the notice, the City shall obtain the proceeds of the security and shall cause such work to be completed.

(3)    The applicant is responsible for all costs incurred by the City in administering, maintaining, or making the improvements covered by the security(ies). The City shall release or refund any proceeds of a performance or maintenance security remaining after subtracting all costs for doing the work or making the improvements covered by the security. The applicant shall reimburse the City for any amount expended by the City that exceeds the proceeds of the security. The City may file a lien against the subject property for the amount of any excess.

(4)    In each case where the City uses any of the funds of a security, it shall give the applicant an itemized statement of all funds used. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)

Part III.    Administrative Review Procedures


14.16A.205 Purpose.

It is the intent of this part to provide the administrative review procedures for applications and land use actions classified as Types I through VI. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.210 Types of Review.

(a)    The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the six levels of land use review. Land use and development decisions are classified into six processes based on who makes the decision, the amount of discretion exercised by the decision maker, the level of impact associated with the decision, the amount and type of input sought, and the type of appeal opportunity.

(b)    Classification of Permits and Decisions.

(1)    Type I Review - Administrative Decisions without Notice. A Type I process is an administrative review and decision by the appropriate department or division. Applications reviewed under the Type I process are minor administrative decisions and are exempt from certain administrative procedures, such as complete application review, noticing, and decision time frames. Appeals of Type I decisions are made to the Hearing Examiner, except shoreline permit appeals are made to the Shoreline Hearings Board. The permits and actions reviewed and decided as Type I are listed in the table in subsection (d) of this section.

(2)    Type II Review - Administrative Decisions with Notice. A Type II process is an administrative review and decision with recommendation from staff, City departments or others and requiring public notice at the application and/or decision stages of the review. Appeals of Type II decisions are made to the Hearing Examiner, except shoreline permit appeals are made to the Shoreline Hearings Board. The permits and actions reviewed and decided as Type II are listed in the table in subsection (d) of this section.

(3)    Type III Review - Quasi-Judicial Decisions - Hearing Examiner. This Type III process is a quasi-judicial review and decision by the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner makes a decision based on a staff report. The Hearing Examiner considers public testimony received at an open record public hearing. Public notification is provided at the application, public hearing, and decision stages of application review. Appeals of Hearing Examiner decisions are made to Snohomish County Superior Court, except shoreline permit appeals are made to the Shoreline Hearings Board. The permits and actions reviewed and decided as Type III are listed in the table in subsection (d) of this section.

(4)    Type IV Review - Quasi-Judicial Decisions - City Council with Hearing Examiner Recommendation. A Type IV process is a quasi-judicial review and recommendation by the Hearing Examiner and a decision by the City Council. The Hearing Examiner considers public testimony received at an open record public hearing. The City Council makes a decision based on a recommendation from the Hearing Examiner during a closed record public meeting. Public notification is provided at the application, public hearing, and decision stages of application review. There is no opportunity for an administrative appeal. Appeals of City Council decisions are made to Snohomish County Superior Court. The permits and actions reviewed and decided as Type IV are listed in the table in subsection (d) of this section.

(5)    Type V Review - Quasi-Judicial Decisions - City Council. A Type V process is a quasi-judicial review and decision by the City Council. Public notification is provided at the application, public hearing (if any), and decision stages of application review. There is no opportunity for an administrative appeal. Appeals of City Council decisions are made to Snohomish County Superior Court. The permits and actions reviewed and decided as Type V are listed in the table in subsection (d) of this section.

(6)    Type VI Review - Legislative Decisions - City Council with Planning Commission Recommendation. A Type VI review is for legislative and/or nonproject decisions by the City Council under its authority to establish policies and regulations regarding future private and public development and management of public lands. The Planning Commission makes a recommendation to the City Council. The Planning Commission will conduct a public hearing to obtain public testimony on the proposed legislation. The City Council may elect to conduct an additional public hearing. The actions reviewed and decided as Type VI are listed in the table in subsection (d) of this section.

(c)    Permits and Actions Not Listed. If a permit or land use action is not listed in Table 14.16A-I, the Planning Director shall make the determination as to the appropriate review procedure.

(d)    Permit-Issuing Authority and Appeal Authority. The permit-issuing authority and appeal authority for permit applications and legislative actions are established in Table 14.16A-I. A detailed explanation for each review procedure is in Chapter 14.16B under each part for each review type.

(Ord. 1068, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 1023, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 969, Sec. 3, 2016; Ord. 903, Sec. 8, 2013; Ord. 876, Sec. 9, 2012; Ord. 860, Sec. 3, 2011; Ord. 855, Sec. 5, 2011; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.215 Land Use Permits Required.

(a)    Prior to building construction or alteration, substantial change of use, land clearing, or grading, the property owner is required to obtain a land use permit for the proposal.

(b)    Whenever a proposed project requires more than one land use permit, the permits will be processed simultaneously using the consolidated permit process specified in Section 14.16A.220(g). (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.220 Application Procedures.

(a)    This section describes the requirements for making application for review, including pre-application conferences, submittal requirements, and fees.

(b)    Applications for development permits and other land use actions shall be made to the Department of Planning and Community Development, except Type I applications shall be made to the department which has the decision making authority (see Section 14.16A.210(d)).

(c)    The property owner or any agent of the owner with authorized proof of agency may apply for a permit or approval under the type of process specified. Consent to the application must be made by the owners or lessees of property or persons who have contracted to purchase property. Signatures by agents of these parties may be accepted, if a letter from the party with ownership interest is submitted which authorizes the agent to sign the application in their name.

(d)    Pre-Application Conferences.

(1)    To achieve efficient and effective application of the requirements of this title, a pre-application conference between the applicant and the City staff is required for projects needing a conditional use permit, planned action certification and planned neighborhood developments.

(2)    Pre-application conferences are highly recommended for applications requiring Type III, IV or V reviews, and/or design review. Pre-application conferences are optional for applications requiring Type I, II and VI reviews.

(3)    Prior to submitting an application, the applicant may arrange a conference with Planning and Public Works staff to review the proposed action, to become familiar with City policies, plans and development requirements and to coordinate all necessary permits and procedures. Pre-application procedures and submittal requirements shall be determined by the Planning Director and available in the Department of Planning and Community Development.

(4)    Since it is impossible for the conference to be an exhaustive review of all potential issues, the discussions at the conference shall not bind or prohibit the City’s future application or enforcement of all applicable law.

(5)    To request a pre-application conference, an applicant shall submit a set of preliminary plans to the City. The amount and quality of the information submitted is up to the applicant; however, better information provided initially is more likely to result in better feedback and discussion with planning staff. At a minimum, the plans should include a basic layout of the proposal, including circulation, lot patterns and building locations, location of critical areas, and other site constraints.

(e)    Submittal Requirements.

(1)    The Planning Director shall specify submittal requirements, including type, detail, and number of copies, for an application to be complete. Submittal requirements for each permit application shall be available in the Department of Planning and Community Development. At a minimum the following shall be submitted with new applications:

(i)    General application form;

(ii)    Applicable fees;

(iii)    Environmental checklist (if not exempt);

(iv)    Applicable signatures, stamps or certifications;

(v)    All required items stated in the applicable development handouts.

(2)    The Planning Director may waive in writing specific submittal requirements determined to be unnecessary for review of an application. Alternatively, the Planning Director may require additional material, such as maps, studies, or models, when the Planning Director determines such material is needed to adequately assess the proposed project and submits the request in writing to the applicant.

(3)    Applications for shoreline substantial development permits shall include submittal of the supplemental requirements set forth in Chapter 7 of the Shoreline Master Program and shoreline permits application materials.

(f)    Determination of Complete Application.

(1)    The presumption established by this title is that all of the information set forth in the specified submittal checklists is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. However, each development is unique, and therefore the Planning Director may request additional information, if necessary, or may waive certain items if it is determined they are not necessary to ensure that the project complies with City requirements.

(2)    The Planning Director shall make a determination of completeness pursuant to Section 14.16A.230(c).

(g)    Consolidated Permit Process.

(1)    When applying concurrently for a development that involves two or more related applications, individual permit numbers shall be assigned and separate permit fees shall be paid, but the applications shall be reviewed and processed collectively. A consolidated report setting forth the recommendation and decision shall be issued.

(2)    Applications processed in accordance with subsection (g)(1) of this section, which have the same highest numbered procedure but are assigned different hearing bodies, shall be heard collectively by the highest decision maker(s). The City Council is the highest, followed by the Hearing Examiner and then Administrative.

(3)    No hearing or deliberation upon an application for a conditional use permit, subdivision, variance, planned neighborhood development, site plan review, administrative conditional use permit, shoreline permit, or similar quasi-judicial or administrative action, which is inconsistent with the existing Zoning Map, shall be scheduled for the same meeting at which the required Zoning Map amendment will be considered by the Hearing Examiner or the City Council. This section is intended to be a procedural requirement applicable to such actions as noted in RCW 58.17.070.

(h)    Application and Inspection Fees. Fees are set forth in a separate fees resolution adopted by the City Council. (Ord. 1068, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 898, Sec. 2, 2013; Ord. 876, Sec. 10, 2012; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)


14.16A.225 Noticing Requirements.

(a)    Mailed Notices and Postcard Notices.

(1)    Mailings shall include a mailed notice or postcard notice to owners of real property within 300 feet of the project site, or 20 property owners (whichever results in more property owners being noticed), including the project name and number and the following information. Mailings may provide a website address where detailed information is available for viewing. Mailings shall include the following information or Internet addresses to the following information:

(i)    The date of application and the date of the notice of application;

(ii)    A description of the proposed project action and a list of the project permits included in the application and, if applicable, a list of any studies requested under RCW 36.70B.070;

(iii)    The identification of other permits not included in the application, to the extent known by the City;

(iv)    The identification of existing environmental documents that evaluate the proposed project, and, if not otherwise stated on the document providing notice of application, the location where the application and any studies can be reviewed;

(v)    A statement of the limits of the public comment period;

(vi)    A statement of the right of any person to comment on the application, receive notice of and participate in any hearings, request a hearing, if applicable, request a copy of the decision once made, and any appeal rights;

(vii)    The date, time, place and type of meeting or hearing, if applicable, and if it is scheduled at the date of notice of the application;

14.16A.230 Time Frames for Review.

(a)    Purpose. RCW 36.70B.070 and 36.70B.080 require time frames be established to ensure applications are reviewed in a timely and predictable manner. This subsection establishes the time frames and procedures for a determination of completeness and final decision for Type II, III, IV or V reviews. No time frames are established by these statutes for Type I or VI reviews.

(b)    Computing Time. Unless otherwise specified, all time frames are indicated as calendar days, not working days. For the purposes of computing time, the day the determination or decision is rendered shall not be included. The last day of the time period shall be included; provided, that if it is a Saturday, Sunday, a day designated by RCW 1.16.050 or by the City’s ordinances as a legal holiday, then it also is excluded and the time period concludes at the end of the next business day.

(c)    Complete Application Review Time Frame. The following procedures shall be applied to new applications requiring Type II, III, IV, or V reviews. Applications requiring Type I or VI review are excluded from this requirement.

(1)    Within 28 days after receiving an application, the Planning Director shall mail, email, fax, or otherwise provide to the applicant a written determination that the application is complete, or that the application is incomplete, and what is necessary to make the application complete. The applicant has 90 days to submit the necessary information to the City.

(2)    If the Planning Director does not provide a written determination within the 28 days, the application shall be deemed complete at the end of the twenty-eighth day.

(3)    If additional information is needed to make the application complete, the Planning Director shall notify the applicant whether the application is complete or what additional information is necessary within 14 days after an applicant has submitted the information identified by the Planning Director as being needed.

(4)    An application is complete for purposes of this section when it meets the submittal requirements established by the Planning Director and is sufficient for continued processing, even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequently. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the Planning Director from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the Notice of Completeness or subsequently, if new information is required to complete review of the application or substantial changes in the permit application are proposed.

(5)    To the extent known by the City, other agencies with jurisdiction over the project permit application shall be identified in the City’s determination of completeness required by subsection (c)(1) of this section.

(d)    Application Review and Decision Time Frame.

(1)    Decisions on Type II, III, IV, or V applications shall not exceed 120 days, unless the Planning Director makes written findings that a specified amount of additional time is needed for processing of a specific complete project application. Applications for developments that are complex or that have extensive or difficult issues may take additional time. The applicant and the City may agree in writing to extend the time period.

(2)    Preliminary Plats. Pursuant to RCW 58.17.140, preliminary plats of any proposed subdivision and dedication shall be approved, disapproved, or returned to the applicant for modification or correction within 90 days from the date of filing thereof unless the applicant consents to an extension of such time period or the 90-day limitation is extended to include up to 21 days as specified under RCW 58.17.095(3). The 90-day period shall not include the time spent preparing and circulating an environmental impact statement by the local governmental agency.

(3)    Final Plats and Short Plats. Pursuant to RCW 58.17.140, final plats and short plats shall be approved, disapproved, or returned to the applicant within 30 days from the date of filing thereof, unless the applicant consents to an extension of such time period.

(4)    Appeals. The time period for consideration and decision on appeals shall not exceed 90 days for an open record appeal hearing and 60 days for a closed record appeal. The parties may agree in writing to extend these time periods. Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the City shall be in writing.

(5)    Exemptions. The time limits established in this title do not apply if a project permit application:

(i)    Requires an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan or a development regulation;

(ii)    Requires approval of the siting of an essential public facility as provided in RCW 36.70A.200;

(iii)    Is reviewed as Type I or VI permit;

(iv)    Is substantially revised by the applicant, in which case the time period shall start from the date at which the revised project application is determined to be complete.

(e)    Calculating Decision Time Frame. In determining the number of days that have elapsed after the City has notified the applicant that the application is complete for purposes of calculating the time for issuance of the notice of final decision, the following periods shall be excluded:

(1)    Any period during which the applicant has been requested by the City to correct plans, perform required studies, or provide additional required information. If the City determines that the information submitted by the applicant is insufficient, it shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies. The period shall be calculated from the date the City notifies the applicant of the need for additional information until the earlier of the date the local government determines whether the additional information satisfies the request for information or 14 days after the date the information has been provided to the City;

(2)    Any period during which an environmental impact statement is being prepared following a determination of significance (DS) pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW, or if the City and the applicant in writing shall agree to a time period for completion of an environmental impact statement;

(4)    Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the City.

(f)    Possible Extension of Time for Final Decision. If the City is unable to issue a final decision within the time limits provided herein, the applicant shall be provided written notice of this fact. The notice shall include a statement of reasons why the time limits have not been met and an estimated date for issuance of the notice of final decision. (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh.

(ii)    The requirements of subsection (f)(3) of this section are met. (RCW 36.70B.110(7))

(2)    Applicant’s Request for a Joint Meeting or Hearing.

In the alternative, the applicant may agree to a particular schedule if that additional time is needed in order to complete the hearings. (RCW 36.70B.110(7))

(3)    Prerequisites to Joint Public Meeting or Hearing. A joint public hearing may be held with another local, State, regional, Federal or other agency and the City, as long as:

(i)    The other agency is not expressly prohibited by statute from doing so; (RCW 36.70B.110(8))

(ii)    Sufficient notice of the meeting or hearing is given to meet each of the agencies’ adopted notice requirements as set forth in statute, ordinance, or rule;

(iii)    The agency has received the necessary information about the proposed project from the applicant in enough time to hold its meeting or hearing at the same time as the local government hearing; and

(iv)    The meeting or hearing is held within the geographic boundary of the local government.

(g)    Modification of Application at Hearing.

(1)    In response to questions or comments by the decision maker or public at the hearing, the applicant may offer to modify the application, including the plans and specifications submitted.

(2)    If the modifications are such that the decision maker, staff or public cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans available for review, the decision making entity may continue the hearing and direct the applicant to prepare revisions or approve the application with conditions deemed necessary to ensure the proposal meets the approval criteria.

(3)    In order to approve the modifications at the meeting, the modifications must be such that they clearly would not require reevaluations of the SEPA checklist and traffic report, additional public notice, and additional agency review.

Any modifications to the decision shall be limited to those necessary to ensure the decision criteria of this title are met.

(c)    Effect of Appeal. Decisions on Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV permits are assumed valid unless overturned by an appeal decision. An appeal stays all actions by the Planning Director seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the Planning Director finds that a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the Hearing Examiner or a court.

(d)    Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies. No action to obtain judicial review may be commenced unless all rights of administrative appeal provided by this title or State law have been exhausted. The cost of transcription of all records ordered certified by the court for such review shall be borne by the appellant. A copy of each transcript prepared by an appellant shall be submitted to the City for confirmation of its accuracy.

(e)    Consolidated Appeals. All appeals of project permit application decisions, other than an appeal of determination of significance (DS), shall be considered together in a consolidated appeal. (RCW 43.21C.075, 36.70B.060(6)) (Ord. 1015, Sec. 4 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2010)

The Hearing Examiner action deciding the appeal and approving, approving with modifications, or denying a project is the final City decision on a Type III application. A final appeal may be made to the Snohomish County Superior Court. (Ord. 1068, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 811, Sec. 3 (Exh. 2), 2010)

(b)    Procedure. Administrative conditional uses shall follow the procedures established in Chapter 14.16B for a Type II permit process, which requires public notice including a statement that a hearing can be called for.

(1)    The Planning Director may approve, approve with conditions, or deny an administrative conditional use permit.

(2)    When an application is submitted together with another permit application requiring a decision by the Hearing Examiner, the administrative conditional use permit shall be processed concurrently with the other application and the Hearing Examiner shall make the decision on the administrative conditional use using a Type III process.

(c)    Decision Criteria. The Planning Director may impose conditions to ensure the approval criteria are met. The Planning Director may grant approval for an administrative conditional use when all the following criteria are met:

(1)    The proposal is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;

(2)    The proposal complies with applicable requirements for the use set forth in this title;

(3)    The proposal is not materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity; and

(4)    The proposal is compatible with and incorporates specific features, conditions, or revisions that ensure it responds appropriately to the existing or intended character, appearance, quality of development, and physical characteristics of the subject property and the immediate vicinity.

(d)    Optional Hearing.

(i)    No new land use is proposed;

(ii)    No increase in density, number of dwelling units or lots is proposed;

(iii)    No changes in location or number of access points are proposed;

(iv)    Minimal reduction in the amount of landscaping is proposed;

(v)    Minimal reduction in the amount of parking is proposed;

(vi)    The total square footage of structures to be developed is the lesser of 10 percent or 6,000 gross square footage; and

14.16C.030 Changes of Use.

(a)    This section governs requests for substantial change of the use of a structure or property.

(b)    Procedure. Change of use applications are reviewed under a Type I review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B.

(c)    A change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a substantial change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned.

(d)    A substantial change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use.

(e)    A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever a new use or activity conducted on a lot creates a more intensive impact to the site in question or to the infrastructure of the City than the previous use, as determined by the Planning Director. This occurs whenever:

(1)    If the original use is a combination use or planned neighborhood development, the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned neighborhood development use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered.

(2)    If the original use is a combination use or planned neighborhood development use and the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned neighborhood development use changes.

(3)    If the original use is a planned residential development and the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change.

(4)    If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use) and that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business) causing site impacts that are more intensive.

(f)    Decision Criteria. A determination of whether to approve a substantial change of use shall include review of, but not be limited to, the following:

(1)    Hours of operation;

(2)    Materials processed or sold;

(3)    Required parking;

(4)    Traffic generation;

(5)    Impact on public utilities;

(6)    Clientele; and

(7)    General appearance and location. (Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)

14.16C.045 Conditional Uses.

(a)    A conditional use permit is a mechanism by which the City may place special conditions on the use of land in order to ensure that designated uses or activities are compatible with other uses in the same zone and in the vicinity of the subject property.

(b)    Procedure. Conditional uses shall follow the procedures established in Chapter 14.16B for a Type III permit process with the addition of a required scoping meeting. A project may be developed in phases, if more than five years have lapsed since final approval of the project; provided, that uncompleted divisions shall be subject to the standards adopted at the start of subsequent phases.

(1)    The Hearing Examiner may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a conditional use permit.

(2)    When an application is submitted together with another permit application requiring a decision by the Hearing Examiner, the conditional use permit shall be processed concurrently with the other application.

(c)    Scoping Meeting. The purpose of scoping meetings is to involve the public early in the permit process, so that potential issues are raised at the beginning, rather than the end. Meetings shall be held pursuant to Section 14.16A.260.

(1)    Scoping meetings shall generally be held in the evenings.

(2)    The meeting shall be informal, at which a brief presentation of the project shall be made by the applicant. The Planning Director will explain the review process and opportunity for citizen involvement, after which any participant may raise any potential issues of concern to them. Solutions to any potential problems need not be found at this point but may be discussed. The Department shall take notes of the issues raised in the scoping meeting and place a record of them in the official file of the project.

(3)    Participation or lack of participation in a scoping meeting in no way limits the standing of an applicant, the City, or any other person to participate in later processes or required hearings on the permit application.

(d)    Decision Criteria.

(1)    The Hearing Examiner may grant approval for a conditional use when all the following criteria are met:

(i)    The proposal is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;

(ii)    The proposal complies with applicable requirements for the use set forth in this title;

(iii)    The conditional use is designed in a manner which is compatible with and responds to the existing or intended character, appearance, quality of development, and physical characteristics of the subject property and immediate vicinity;

(iv)    The location, size and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences, and screening vegetation for the conditional use shall not hinder neighborhood circulation or discourage the permitted development or use of neighboring properties;

(v)    The type of use, hours of operation, and appropriateness of the use in relation to adjacent uses will not create unusual hazards or characteristics of the use that would have adverse impacts;

(vi)    The conditional use is designed in a manner that is compatible with the physical characteristics of the subject property;

(vii)    Requested modifications to standards are limited to those which will mitigate impacts in a manner equal to or greater than the standards of this title;

(viii)    The conditional use is such that pedestrian and vehicular traffic associated with the use will not be hazardous or conflict with existing and anticipated traffic in the neighborhood; and

(ix)    The conditional use will be supported by adequate public facilities or services and will not adversely affect public services to the surrounding area, or conditions can be established to mitigate adverse impacts on such facilities.

(2)    As a condition of approval, the Hearing Examiner may:

(i)    Increase requirements in the standards, criteria, or policies established by this title;

(ii)    Stipulate the exact location as a means of minimizing hazards to life, limb, property damage, erosion, landslides, or traffic;

(iii)    Require structural features or equipment essential to serve the same purpose set forth in subsection (d)(1) of this section;

(iv)    Impose conditions similar to those set forth in subsection (d)(1) of this section as may be deemed necessary to establish parity with uses permitted in the same zone in their freedom from nuisance generating features in matters of noise, odors, air pollution, wastes, vibration, traffic, physical hazards, and similar matters. The Hearing Examiner may not, in connection with action on a conditional use permit, reduce the requirements specified by this title as pertaining to any use nor otherwise reduce the requirements of this title in matters for which a variance is the remedy provided;

(v)    Assure that the degree of compatibility with the purpose of this title shall be maintained with respect to the particular use on the particular site and in consideration of other existing and potential uses, within the general area in which the use is proposed to be located;

(vi)    Recognize and compensate for variations and degree of technological processes and equipment, as related to the factors of noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, and hazard or public need;

(vii)    Require the posting of construction and maintenance bonds or other security sufficient to secure to the City the estimated cost of construction and/or installation and maintenance of required improvements; and

(viii)    Impose any requirement that will protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

(e)    Revision of Conditional Use Permits. Revisions of previous permit approvals are permitted as per Section 14.16C.025, Administrative Modifications.

(f)    Vacation of Conditional Use Permit. Landowner request for vacation of a conditional use permit shall be conducted in accordance with Section 14.16A.240. Any conditional use permit issued pursuant to this section may be vacated at the request of the current landowner upon City approval provided:

(1)    The use authorized by the permit does not exist and is not actively being pursued; or

(2)    The use has been terminated, and no violation of the terms and the conditions of the permit exists.

(g)    Review or Revocation of Permit. The Planning Director shall have jurisdiction to review and modify or revoke all conditional uses in accordance with Section 14.16A.255.

(h)    Transfer of Ownership. A conditional use permit runs with the land, and compliance with the conditions of any such permit is the responsibility of the current owner of the property, whether that is the original applicant or a successor. (Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)

(Ord. 1068, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 1027, Sec. 3, 2018; Ord. 903, Sec. 19, 2013; Ord. 876, Sec. 12, 2012; Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)


14.16C.055 Development Agreements.

(a)    Purpose and Authority.

(1)    The purpose of this section is to set forth the decision-making and appeal procedures for development agreement applications. In adopting these provisions, the City acknowledges the benefits, including development or redevelopment, of providing certainty regarding applicable development standards, uses, and/or mitigation for major projects or long-term, phased proposals that take years to complete and that require substantial financial commitments at an early stage. The City may, when appropriate, enhance certainty by entering into a development agreement with a project sponsor that addresses the requirements for review of the development application and construction of the project. A development agreement provides the opportunity for the City and the developer to agree on the scope and timing of the project, applicable regulations and requirements, mitigation requirements and other matters relating to the development process. A development agreement promotes the general welfare by balancing the public and private interests, providing reasonable certainty for a development project, and addressing other matters, including reimbursement over time for the financing of public facilities. Development agreements may provide public benefits, such as affordable housing, pedestrian-oriented communities, mixed use development, and creation of public amenities such as park and open spaces.

(2)    This section applies to development agreement applications made pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210 and this chapter. These provisions do not apply to or affect the validity of any contract rezone, concomitant agreement, annexation agreement or other agreement in existence on or before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or adopted under separate authority, even though such agreements may also relate to development standards, mitigation, and other regulatory requirements. The City may approve and enter into a development agreement with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity that controls real property.

(b)    Real Property Covered. A development agreement may apply to any real property within the City and to any real property within the City’s urban growth area.

(c)    Procedure - Development Agreements.

(1)    This section shall not apply to the review of development agreements for projects to site, construct, operate or expand essential public facilities. For those facilities, the development agreement shall be presented to the City Council for approval upon the adoption of a resolution meeting the requirements of this section. Procedures for the review of permits applicable to such facilities shall be specified in the development agreement.

(2)    Development agreements shall be reviewed in the manner and following the procedures established in Chapters 14.16A and 14.16B for a Type VI review except no review by the Planning Commission.

(d)    Decision Criteria. The City Council may adopt a development agreement upon passage of a resolution with findings that:

(1)    The proposed agreement is compatible with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan;

(2)    The proposed agreement is consistent with applicable development regulations;

(3)    The proposed agreement provides for adequate mitigation of adverse environmental impacts; provided, that if the development is not sufficiently characterized at a project level, the agreement shall provide a process for evaluating and appropriately mitigating such impacts in the future; and

(4)    The proposed agreement reserves authority to impose new or different regulations to the extent required by a serious threat to public health and safety.

(e)    Agreement Contents. A proposed development agreement shall, at a minimum, include provisions required by RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210 and shall set forth the development standards and other provisions that shall apply to and govern the use and development of the real property for the duration specified in the agreement not to exceed 10 years. An agreement may also contain such other provisions as the City and the property owner or person controlling the property agree on, such items as, but not limited to, the financing for or timing of mitigation and the vesting of development rights. A development agreement shall be consistent with applicable development regulations. Each development agreement shall include findings of consistency for any modification to existing regulations and standards.

(f)    Recording Required. A development agreement shall be recorded with the real property records of the Snohomish County Auditor and shall be binding during its term on the parties and their successors.

(g)    Modification of Development Agreement. Modification of an approved development agreement shall require processing as a new development agreement, except that a development agreement may provide a range of modifications that may be approved by the department without reprocessing.

(h)    Appeal of Development Agreement.

(1)    A development agreement shall be subject to appeal in Snohomish County Superior Court in accordance with the provisions of the Land Use Petition Act, Chapter 36.70C RCW.

(2)    The cost of transcribing the record of proceedings, of copying photographs, video tapes, and any oversized documents, and of staff time spent in copying and assembling the record and preparing the record for filing with the court shall be borne by the party filing the petition. If more than one party appeals the decision, the costs of preparing the record shall be borne equally among the appellants. (Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)


14.16C.060 Essential Public Facilities.

(a)    The purpose of this section is to provide a process to site necessary public uses that may otherwise be difficult to site. This process involves the community and identifies and minimizes adverse impacts. Examples of essential public facilities include schools, water transmission lines, sewer collection lines and pump stations, fire stations, hospitals, jails, prisons, airports, solid waste transfer stations, highways, stormwater facilities, and wastewater treatment plants. Secure community transition facilities are also included.

(b)    Procedure. Applications that seek approval for an essential public facility or for a secure community transition facility shall follow the procedures established in Chapter 14.16B for a Type IV permit process.

(c)    Development Regulations Applicable to Essential Public Facilities. The City Council may approve a development agreement, pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170, that creates exemptions or modifications to the requirements of this title in order to allow for the siting, development or expansion of an essential public facility.

(d)    Process. Essential public facilities which are not already sited in a local Comprehensive Plan are eligible for review under the common siting process described below. Candidate facility proposals may be submitted for review under this review process by either the project sponsor or by a local jurisdiction proposing to site the project.

(1)    A facility may be designated an essential public facility eligible for review under this process under the following conditions:

(i)    The Snohomish County Tomorrow Steering Committee or the Lake Stevens City Council makes a determination that the proposed facility meets the definition of an essential public facility; or the facility appears on the State, County, or the host community’s list of essential public facilities; and

(ii)    Either the sponsoring agency or the City of Lake Stevens determines that the facility will be difficult to site.

(2)    An agency may request the City Council determine if a facility is considered an essential public facility in advance of applying for approval of the appropriate land use permit(s). To make such a request, the agency shall submit to the Department of Planning and Community Development a detailed written description of the facility, and concept level plans (if available) along with a fee to be set by Council resolution. The City Council shall make a determination within 30 days of receipt of a complete request.

(3)    For a proposed facility in which an advance determination has not been made, the City Council must make a determination that the proposal is subject to the essential public facility process within in the same time frame and manner as determining when an application is complete (Section 14.16A.220(f)).

(4)    Either the sponsor of an essential public facility which is eligible for review under the common site review process, or the City of Lake Stevens, may elect to follow the process described below. Alternatively, sponsors of such facilities having a preferred site location already identified may choose to seek siting approval under the local process provided by the City of Lake Stevens, if that approach is acceptable to the City. The common site review process will involve the steps described below:

(i)    Determination of Eligibility. The project sponsor must receive a determination of eligibility from either the City or the Snohomish County Tomorrow Steering Committee that the proposed facility constitutes an essential public facility. This step will also include a determination of whether the proposed facility presents siting difficulties.

(ii)    Site Search Consultation. As an optional service to project sponsors, the Planning Advisory Committee (PAC) and/or the Infrastructure Coordinating Committee (ICC) will, upon request, provide a forum for project sponsors prior to the initiation of the formal siting review process. Sponsors will have the opportunity to present proposed projects for the purpose of seeking information on potential sites within Snohomish County and about potential concerns related to siting. Sponsors may also propose possible incentives for host communities. Through the PAC/ICC, the City may be requested to provide information to sponsors regarding potential sites within their communities. The sponsor of an eligible project electing to utilize this siting process may initiate this communication by contacting Snohomish County Tomorrow and requesting aid in the siting of its proposed facility.

(iii)    Local Land Use Review. Following site consultation with the PAC and/or ICC (when that step is taken by the sponsor), the sponsor may apply for the appropriate land use permit from the City. The City shall conduct its review as required by this common siting process, as well its own codes and ordinances. The City shall evaluate the proposal against the common siting criteria described in subsection (d)(2) of this section, as well as against other City criteria appropriate to the particular permit(s) being requested.

(iv)    Advisory Review Process. The City’s decision on the land use permit, as it relates to the site evaluation criteria described in subsection (d)(2) of this section, is subject to an advisory review process. This process, if utilized, would occur prior to any appeal processes already provided by local ordinances.

(v)    Within 21 days following the decision on a land use permit, the sponsor may request review of the decision by an advisory review board appointed by the Snohomish County Tomorrow Executive Board. The board shall not have authority to overturn a local decision. The board, on review of the record, shall only find that the local decision does or does not accurately reflect the evidence provided by the sponsor, or that adequate consideration was or was not given to the evaluation criteria, and may recommend to the local agency that it reconsider its decision. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the administrative appeal or legal remedies otherwise available to sponsors, the City, or third parties.

(vi)    Permit Application. Upon receipt of the required land use approvals, the sponsor may apply for necessary permits to construct the proposed facility.

(e)    Essential Public Facilities - Development and Operating Requirements.

(1)    The Growth Management Act requires cities to include in their Comprehensive Plans a process for identifying and siting essential public facilities (EPFs). Essential public facilities are described in the Act as those facilities which are typically difficult to site, but are needed to support orderly growth and delivery of services. The Act states that no local Comprehensive Plan or development regulation may preclude the siting of essential public facilities.

(2)    In addition to the appropriate land use permit review criteria, the following shall apply to essential public facilities:

(i)    Documentation of Need. Project sponsors must demonstrate the need for their proposed EPFs. Included in the analysis of need should be the projected service population, an inventory of existing and planned comparable facilities and projected demand for this type of essential public facility.

(ii)    Consistency with Sponsor’s Plans. The proposed project shall be consistent with the sponsor’s own long-range plans for facilities and operations.

(iii)    Consistency with Other Plans. The proposed project must demonstrate the relationship of the project to local, regional and state plans. The proposal should be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans of the City of Lake Stevens. In evaluating this consistency, consideration shall be given to urban growth area designations and critical area designations, population and employment holding capacities and targets, and the land use, capital facilities and utilities elements of these adopted plans.

(iv)    Relationship of Service Area to Population. The facility’s service area population should include a significant share of the host community’s population, and the proposed site should be able to reasonably serve its overall service area population. However, linear transmission facilities are exempt from this criterion.

(v)    Minimum Site Requirements. Sponsors shall submit documentation showing the minimum siting requirements for the proposed facility. Site requirements may be determined by the following factors: minimum size of the facility, access, support facilities, topography, geology, and mitigation needs. The sponsor shall also identify future expansion needs of the facilities.

(vi)    Alternative Site Selection. The project sponsor shall search for and investigate alternative sites before submitting a proposal for conditional use permit or rezone. The proposal shall indicate whether any alternative sites have been identified that meet the minimum site requirements of the facility. The sponsor’s site selection methodology will also be reviewed. The Planning Director may reject the methodology citing specific errors or omissions; in which case, the sponsor shall correct the errors and omissions prior to proceeding with the City review. Where a proposal involves expansion of an existing facility, the documentation shall indicate why relocation of the facility to another site would be infeasible.

(vii)    Distribution of Essential Public Facilities. In considering a proposal, the City shall examine the overall distribution of essential public facilities within Snohomish County to avoid placing an undue burden on any one community.

(viii)    Public Participation. Sponsors shall encourage local public participation in the development of the proposal, including mitigation measures. Sponsors shall conduct local outreach efforts with early notification to prospective neighbors to inform them about the project and to engage local residents in site planning and mitigation design prior to the initiation of formal hearings. The City’s scoping process may be an element of this outreach, but it is expected the communication between the sponsor and the residents shall extend beyond that process. The sponsor’s efforts in this regard shall be evaluated.

(ix)    Proposed Impact Mitigation. The proposal must include adequate and appropriate mitigation measures for the impacted area(s) and community(ies). Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, natural features that will be preserved or created to serve as buffers, other site design elements used in the development plan, and/or operational or other programmatic measures contained in the proposal. The proposed measures should be adequate to substantially reduce or compensate for anticipated adverse impacts on the local environment.

(f)    Secure Community Transition Facilities.

(1)    A conditional use permit for secure community transition facility (SCTF) shall not be approved if it can be demonstrated that the Lake Stevens Urban Growth Area (LSUGA), including all incorporated and unincorporated lands, already accommodates its fair share, based on population, of Snohomish County’s quota for beds as assigned by the State, except that this fair share can be exceeded if necessary to meet the State’s standard for a minimum of three beds per facility.

(2)    No secure community transition facility (SCTF) shall house more than three persons, excluding resident staff.

(3)    SCTFs should be located in relationship to transportation facilities in a manner appropriate to their transportation needs.

(4)    No SCTFs shall be allowed in the following distances from the following specified uses, areas or zones, whether such uses, areas or zones are located within or outside the city limits. Adjacent to, immediately across the street or parking lot from, or within the line of sight of a “risk potential activity” as defined in RCW 71.09.020, as amended, that include, but are not limited to:

(i)    Public and private schools;

(ii)    School bus stops;

(iii)    Licensed day care and licensed pre-school facilities;

(iv)    Public parks, publicly dedicated trails, and sports fields;

(v)    Recreational community centers;

(vi)    Churches, synagogues, temples and mosques; and

(vii)    Public libraries.

(5)    With a conditional use permit application, the project sponsor shall provide the following additional information:

(i)    Proposed mitigation measures to offset any aesthetic, privacy and security impacts on the surrounding properties.

(ii)    Proposed operating rules and procedures for staff and residents.

(iii)    A schedule of all meetings in which public input has or will be solicited, and a summary of the public input which has been provided to date.

(6)    Prior to the issuance of a building permit, or, if no building permit is necessary, a certificate of occupancy, the Department of Social and Health Services shall enter into an interlocal agreement with the Lake Stevens Police Department which identifies the obligations of the facility to keep the Police Department informed of activities, problems and security procedures; and identifies any exceptional services that will be required from the Police Department as well as compensation paid in exchange for said services.

No area of less than 10 contiguous, developable acres may be zoned as a PND district, and then only upon the request of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be covered by such zone.

(2)    Each PND district shall include a medium density residential element, comprised of R4, R6 or R8-12 depending on the underlying zoning district. Within that portion of the PND zone that is developed for medium density residential purposes, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the Medium Density Residential zoning district used in the PND.

(3)    A second element of each PND district may include a multi-family residential element corresponding to the zoning districts described in Section 14.36.010(a)(5). Not more than 35 percent of the total area may be developed for higher density residential purposes. Within the portion of the PND developed for higher density residential, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the zoning district to which the PND district corresponds.

14.16C.095 Right-of-Way Vacation.

(a)    The purpose of this section is to provide procedures and requirements for the vacation of public rights-of-way and streets. The owners of an interest in any real estate abutting upon any street or alley who may desire to vacate the street or alley, or any part thereof, may petition the City Council for the vacation, or the City Council may initiate, by resolution, such vacation procedure.

(b)    Special Requirements. For applications initiated by property owners, the application shall contain the signatures of the owners of at least two-thirds by frontage of the property abutting the portion of right-of-way proposed to be vacated.

(c)    Procedure. Applications to vacate right-of-way shall be reviewed as a Type V review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B.

(1)    If the application is approved, the City Council shall vacate the right-of-way by ordinance. The ordinance of vacation may provide that the vacation shall not become effective until owners of property abutting the vacated right-of-way compensate the City. The ordinance enacted to vacate the right-of-way shall be recorded with Snohomish County. Compensation may be required as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(2)    Alternative Methods of Vacation. Right-of-way vacations may be processed under the alternative methods provided in Chapter 35A.47 RCW, which is incorporated by reference.

(d)    Survey Requirements. It shall be the duty of the Public Works Director or City Engineer to determine whether or not the location and legal description of the street or alley proposed for vacation are sufficiently known to the City so that an accurate legal description of the proposed vacation can be known with certainty. If the Public Works Director or City Engineer determines that these matters are not known or are not accurately known, then the City shall notify the petitioners of the necessity of having an accurate, professional survey of the property proposed for vacation within the boundaries of the proposed vacation marked upon the ground with an accurate legal description of the proposed vacation to be furnished to the City. The City shall not proceed further upon the vacation petition until such a survey has been done and an accurate legal description has been received.

(e)    Appraisal. In all cases where the City Council requires compensation for the vacated right-of-way, an appraisal of the right-of-way proposed for vacation shall be made by one or more of the following methods:

(1)    The assessed value of comparable abutting property shall be obtained from the records of the Snohomish County assessor. The average of said values, on a square foot basis, shall be applied to the right-of-way which is proposed for vacation.

(2)    The petitioner shall be required to submit a report of a professional appraiser to the City, stating the fair market value of the right-of-way proposed for vacation.

(3)    The City shall obtain a report from one or more professional appraisers stating the fair market value of the right-of-way proposed for vacation. The cost of said report or reports shall be paid by the petitioner prior to the time of the public hearing.

(f)    Decision Criteria.

(1)    The City Council may vacate any street, alley or any parts thereof, if any portion thereof abuts any body of fresh water, when such vacation is sought to enable the City or State to acquire the property for boat moorage or launching sites, park, viewpoint, recreational, or educational purposes or other public uses.

(2)    The City Council shall use the following criteria for deciding upon the petition:

(i)    The vacation will provide a public benefit, and/or will be for a public purpose;

(ii)    The right-of-way vacation shall not adversely affect the street pattern or circulation of the immediate area or the community as a whole;

(iii)    The public need shall not be adversely affected;

(iv)    The right-of-way is not contemplated or needed for future public use; and

(v)    No abutting owner will become landlocked or its access will not be substantially impaired (i.e., there must be an alternative mode of ingress and egress, even if less convenient); provided, that the City Council may, at the time of its public hearing, determine that the City may retain an easement or right to exercise and grant easements in respect to the vacated land for the construction, repair, and maintenance of public utilities and services.

(3)    The City Council will, at the time of the public hearing, determine the amount of compensation to be paid to the City by the petitioners as a condition of the vacation, consistent with the following:

(i)    Where the street or alley has been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, an amount that does not exceed the full appraised value of the area vacated; or

(ii)    Where the street or alley has not been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, an amount which equals one-half of the appraised value of the area vacated.

(g)    Notice to Auditor and Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance vacating any street or alley, or part thereof, shall be filed by the City Clerk with the Snohomish County Auditor’s office and with the Snohomish County Assessor’s office.

(h)    Use of Proceeds of Vacation. One-half of the revenue received by the City as compensation for area vacated under this section shall be dedicated to the acquisition, improvement, development, and related maintenance of open space or transportation capital projects within the City. (Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)


14.16C.100 Shoreline Permits.

(a)    The Shoreline Master Program describes the procedures and requirements for development within specified areas related to lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, and floodplains, as required to implement the Shoreline Management Act, as amended, Chapter 90.58 RCW.

(b)    Permit Required. Chapter 1, Section E.1 of the Shoreline Master Program describes when a substantial shoreline development permit is required for development that materially interferes with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the City. The current shoreline areas are described below:

(1)    Shoreline Areas. The shoreline areas are designated in the Shoreline Master Program and are generally described as:

(i)    Lake Stevens, its underlying land, associated wetlands, and a line 200 feet landward at the line of ordinary high water (elevation 27 feet above sea level) plus the area within the one percent numerical probability floodplain (100-year floodplain) as defined by the best available data.

(ii)    Catherine Creek for approximately one mile south of Hartford Drive NE, the confluence with the outflow from Lake Stevens, where the mean annual flow is 20.0 cubic feet per second or more, and the territory between 200 feet on either side of the tops of the banks, plus associated wetlands and the area within the one percent probability floodplain (100-year floodplain) as defined by the best possible data.

(iii)    Little Pilchuck Creek within the urban growth area as the mean annual flow is 20.0 cubic feet per second or more in these areas, and the territory between 200 feet on either side of the tops of the banks, plus associated wetlands and the area within the one percent probability floodplain (100-year floodplain) as defined by the best possible data.

(2)    Adjacent Areas. Those parcels of land adjacent to the shoreline areas involving projects and developments that overlap into the shoreline areas.

(c)    Exemptions. Certain developments are exempt from the requirement to obtain a substantial development permit pursuant to WAC 173-27-040. An exempt development is only exempt from a shoreline permit, but is still subject to other provisions in the SMP and any other applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. See Chapter 7, Subsection C.1 for a short summary of the types of developments which do not require substantial development permits (see WAC 173-27-040 for detailed descriptions).

(d)    Procedures.

(1)    Applications for a shoreline exemption shall follow the procedures for a Type I review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B.

(2)    Applications for a shoreline substantial development permit shall follow the procedures for a Type II review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B.

(3)    Applications for a shoreline conditional use permit shall follow the procedures for a Type III review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B.

(4)    Applications for a shoreline variance shall follow the procedures for a Type III review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B.

(5)    Special Requirements. No final action or construction shall be taken until 21 days after notice of the final action taken by the City is filed with the Department of Ecology.

(e)    Decision Criteria. All applications, including exemptions, shall comply with the Shoreline Master Program.

(f)    Administrative Provisions. Chapter 7 of the Shoreline Master Program establishes an administrative system designed to assign responsibilities for implementation of the Shoreline Master Program and to outline the process for review of proposals and project applications. All proposed shoreline uses and development, including those that do not require a shoreline permit, must conform to the Shoreline Management Act (SMA) (Chapter 90.58 RCW) and to the policies and regulations of the SMP. Where inconsistencies or conflicts with other sections of the Lake Stevens Municipal Code (LSMC) occur, Chapter 7 of the Shoreline Master Program shall apply. (Ord. 898, Sec. 3, 2013; Ord. 855, Sec. 18, 2011; Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)


14.16C.105 Site Plan Review.

(a)    The intent of this section is to establish procedures for reviewing site plans submitted as part of permit applications. Binding site plans are reviewed under Sections 14.18.105 through 14.18.180. The purpose of the site plan review process is to determine compliance with the City’s applicable development regulations and Comprehensive Plan provisions and to ensure the following have been achieved:

(1)    To coordinate the proposal, as is reasonable and appropriate, with other known or anticipated development on private properties in the area and with known or anticipated right-of-way and other public projects within the area;

(2)    To encourage proposals that embody good design principles that will result in high quality development on the subject property;

(3)    To determine whether the streets and utilities in the area of the subject property are adequate to serve the anticipated demand from the proposal; and

(4)    To review the proposed access to the subject property to determine that it is the optimal location and configuration for access.

(iii)    Within a period of one year, the use of the building for a temporary real estate sales office shall terminate, and the building shall be used exclusively thereafter for uses permitted within that zone and shall meet all building and fire codes applicable thereto, or shall be immediately removed.

(4)    Temporary encampments are to be reviewed as a Type II application pursuant to supplemental regulations contained in Section 14.44.038.

(d)    Recreational Vehicles as Temporary Dwelling Units. No recreational vehicle shall be occupied for residential or commercial purposes anywhere in the City of Lake Stevens except:

(1)    In the case of temporary uses per subsection (c) of this section; or

(2)    Recreational vehicles may be occupied by visitors within residential zones for a period not to exceed 30 days where a Planning Director approval has been granted for such use, provided:

(2)    The temporary use permit shall be effective for no more than 180 days from the date of the first occurrence, except that temporary encampments are limited to 90 days; 

(3)    The temporary use permit shall specify a date upon which the use shall be terminated and removed; and

(4)    A temporary use permit shall not be granted for the same temporary use on a property more than once per calendar year, except that for temporary residences the Planning Director may renew such permit for one additional period not to exceed three months if it is determined such renewal is reasonably necessary to allow the proposed occupants of the permanent residential building to complete the construction, repair, renovation, or restoration work necessary to make such building habitable.

(g)    Temporary Public Structures. Public agencies may erect and use temporary structures (e.g., portable school classrooms, civic uses, emergency command centers, health and social services centers, etc.) upon demonstrating that such a use is for the public benefit and that the use is temporary in nature. Permits for temporary public structures shall expire one year after issuance, but may be renewed annually by the Planning Director upon demonstration of demonstrated public benefit. (Ord. 1031, Sec. 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 991, Sec. 4, 2017; Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)


14.16C.115 Variances.

(a)    A variance is a mechanism by which the City may grant relief to a particular piece of property where practical difficulty renders compliance with the provisions of the land use code an unnecessary hardship, where the hardship is a result of the physical characteristics of the subject property and where the purpose of that code and of the Comprehensive Plan can be fulfilled.

(b)    Procedure. Applications for a variance shall follow the procedures for a Type III review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B. Decisions on variance applications are to be made by the Hearing Examiner following a public hearing.

(c)    Decision Criteria. A variance may be approved if findings are made that the strict enforcement of this title would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of this title will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The Hearing Examiner may reach these conclusions if he or she finds that:

(1)    The requested use is permitted in the zone in which the property is located;

(2)    If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this title, the applicant can make no reasonable use of his property;

(3)    There are special circumstances applicable to the subject property or to the intended use, such as the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, that do not apply generally to other properties or classes of use in the same vicinity and zone;

(4)    The hardship relates to the applicant’s land, rather than personal circumstances;

(5)    The spirit of the standard from which a variance is requested is reasonably maintained, and the granting of a variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege or pose significant hazards or otherwise be detrimental to the surrounding properties; and

(6)    The hardship is not the result of the applicant’s or recent prior owner’s own actions.

(d)    In granting any variance, the Hearing Examiner may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards that will ensure that the purpose and intent of this title shall not be violated. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under which the variance is granted, is a violation of this title and punishable under Title 17.

(e)    Transfer of Ownership. A variance runs with the land and compliance with the conditions of any such permit or variance is the responsibility of the current owner of the property, whether the original applicant or a successor.

(f)    Vacation, Review or Revocation of Variance.

(1)    Any variance issued pursuant to this chapter may be vacated at the request of the current landowner upon City approval; provided, that:

(i)    The use authorized by the variance does not exist and is not actively being pursued; or

(ii)    The use has been terminated and no violation of the terms and the conditions of the permit exists.

(2)    Landowner requests for vacation of a variance shall be conducted in accordance with Section 14.16A.240.

(3)    The office of the Hearing Examiner shall have jurisdiction to review or revoke all variances in accordance with a Type III review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B. (Ord. 811, Sec. 4 (Exh. 3), 2010)


14.16C.120 Administrative Authority.

(a)    Purpose. The intent of this section is to allow the Community Development Director (Director) certain defined flexibility and discretionary authority to consider minor alterations to zoning code regulations including dimensional, parking, landscape and design standards related to sites and/or situations with unique characteristics when the proposed modification provides an equivalent or superior standard to the intended dimensional regulation or design standard.

(b)    Minor Alterations. The Director or designee may authorize de minimis alterations to development regulations if the change is deemed inconsequential to the outcome of the request in relation to the entire project. Any applicant requesting consideration of a de minimis alteration shall demonstrate, at a minimum, how the request complies with the following criteria:

(1)    The alteration promotes creativity in site layout and design that employs special features not otherwise possible under conventional development regulations;

(2)    The alteration will not visually alter the character of the site or neighborhood; and

(3)    The alteration will not be detrimental to surrounding properties in the immediate vicinity.

(c)    Administrative Deviation. The Director or designee may authorize administrative deviations to development regulations up to 15 percent of a quantifiable development standard when situations arise where alternatives to the standards may better accommodate existing conditions, address unique circumstances or allow for more cost-effective solutions without adversely affecting safety, aesthetics, or altering the character of the neighborhood or site. Applications for administrative deviations shall follow the procedures for a Type I review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B, Part I. Any applicant requesting consideration of a deviation shall demonstrate, at a minimum, how the request complies with the following criteria:

(1)    The deviation will achieve the intended result of the standards with a comparable or superior design and quality of improvement;

(2)    The deviation will not adversely affect public safety or the environment;

(3)    The deviation will not adversely affect the aesthetic appearance of the project; and

(4)    The alteration will not be detrimental to surrounding properties in the immediate vicinity.

(d)    Administrative Variance. The Director or designee may authorize administrative variances of development regulations up to 20 percent of a quantifiable development standard where practical difficulty renders compliance with the provisions of this title an unnecessary hardship, where the hardship is a result of the physical characteristics of the subject property and where the purpose of this title and of the Comprehensive Plan can be fulfilled. Applications for an administrative variance shall follow the procedures for a Type II review pursuant to Chapter 14.16B, Part II, following public notice. Any applicant requesting consideration of an administrative variance shall demonstrate, at a minimum, how the request complies with the following criteria:

(1)    The requested use is permitted in the zone in which the property is located;

(2)    The variance is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property that do not apply generally to other properties in the vicinity or same zoning district;

(3)    The intent of the standard from which an administrative variance is requested is reasonably maintained;

(4)    The granting of an administrative variance will not constitute a grant of special privileges or pose significant hazards or otherwise be detrimental to the surrounding properties;

(5)    The administrative variance does not detract from the desired character and nature of the vicinity in which it is proposed; and

(6)    The hardship is not the result of the applicant’s or recent prior owner’s own actions.

(e)    Limitation on Authority. The Director or designee will consider all applicable provisions of the zoning code when reviewing any of the modifications described in subsections (b) through (d) of this section, including nonconforming codes. The Director or designee may not grant an alteration, deviation or variance to:

(1)    Allowed uses in the applicable zoning district;

(2)    Procedural or administrative provisions;

(3)    Increases in the residential density for the applicable zoning district;

(4)    Alterations to critical areas pursuant to Chapter 14.88, except for required buffer widths and building setbacks when the modification includes a mitigation plan meeting the requirements of Chapter 14.88;

(5)    Any standard that is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 969, Sec. 4, 2016)

(b)    Application for a boundary line adjustment (BLA) is made by submitting to the Planning Director a land use development application, with a survey of the subject property showing existing and proposed lot lines, before and after legal descriptions, owner’s certificate, surveyor’s certificate, and Planning Director’s approval certificate.

(c)    To finalize an approved boundary line adjustment, it shall be recorded with the Snohomish County Auditor’s office no later than one year after final approval has been issued by the Planning Director or the application and approval shall lapse, and a new application must be submitted.

(d)    Recording fees and applicable State fees shall be paid by the applicant. Immediately after recording, copies of the recorded BLA documents shall be provided to the City. The BLA shall not take effect until recorded with the Snohomish County Auditor and copies returned to the City.

(e)    The Director or designee may grant up to a one-year extension of a BLA for good cause, if a written request for extension, including a description of reason for request, is submitted to the Planning Director at least two weeks before approval lapses.

(f)    If the BLA affects more than one property owner, a conveyance document(s) shall be recorded at the same time as the BLA documents. The conveyance document(s) shall establish ownership consistent with the approved, adjusted boundaries.

(g)    When a BLA is recorded subsequent to a record of survey for the same property, the recording number of the record of survey shall be noted on the BLA map. (Ord. 1069 § 4, 2020)

Part IV.    Alternative Subdivisions


14.18.300 Planned Residential Developments.

It is intended that a planned residential development (PRD) will result in a higher quality neighborhood that incorporates design for buildings, parks, open space, landscaping, roadways, and other project features; provides flexibility to the property owners; encourages a variety of housing types; and promotes compatibility with the surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to meeting the other relevant requirements of this title, PRDs must comply with the following: 

(a)    The PRD must be located on sites greater than one acre in size within a single-family zoning district.

(b)    The PRD is eligible for a 20 percent density bonus above the allowable density of the underlying zoning district per Chapter 14.48.

(c)    Permissible residential uses within a PRD include single-family detached dwellings, duplexes and attached single-family townhomes of three and four units, regardless of the underlying zoning district. 

(d)    Alternative development standards may be used through the PRD process, including reduced lot size, width, or setback restrictions for a portion of the lots, subject to the following:

(1)    At least 60 percent of the PRD lots must be comprised of single-family detached residences using the development standards of the underlying zoning district, subject to the allowed modifications of this section.

(2)    Duplexes are allowed subject to the lot size requirements of Section 14.48.020 and other elements of this section, unless developed on fee simple lots.

(3)    The PRD may contain graduated densities (i.e., distinct lot patterns representing two or more different zoning districts). 

(i)    If the PRD contains graduated densities, then the second graduated density of SFR lots must be designed to achieve the minimum dimensional standards of the next smaller zoning district’s lot size and lot width standards. 

(ii)    Attached housing portions of a PRD are limited to four units per structure and may not exceed 25 percent of the total PRD dwelling units. 

(4)    Dimensional requirements of the underlying zoning district shall apply within the PRD for each land use proposed, with the following exceptions:

(i)    PRD lot sizes can be reduced up to 25 percent, with no lots being smaller than 3,600 square feet;

(ii)    PRD lot widths can be reduced up to 25 percent, with no lots being narrower than 40 feet;

(iii)    PRD lots can have reduced side setbacks up to 25 percent, with no side setback being less than five feet per side;

(iv)    PRD lots, including lots with attached housing, can have reduced rear setbacks up to 25 percent, with no rear setback being less than 10 feet; and

(v)    Fee simple PRD lots with attached housing of two or more units have no minimum lot size, but must be a minimum 16 feet wide and may have zero-foot internal side setbacks along common walls. Separation between buildings must be a minimum of 10 feet.

(vi)    Impervious areas on attached housing lots may be increased on a lot-by-lot basis, but the entire project may not exceed the impervious area for the underlying zoning district.

(e)    The design of a PRD, including site layout, landscaping, public facilities (e.g., storm drainage, parks, streets, etc.) and building design, shall be subject to design review and shall meet the city’s adopted design guidelines, in addition to the following:

(1)    Primary building entrances shall be located on the front facades of residences and oriented to the primary street or courtyard depending on the overall PRD design.

(2)    Facades shall emphasize the pedestrian entrance to the structure by using distinct architectural features, varied materials, windows, and/or varied rooflines. 

(3)    All homes shall include elements that define the living area or entry of the home as the prominent feature. Homes with garages shall employ the following design features including but not limited to using windows, contrasting colors, materials or other architectural features to soften the appearance of garages. Detached single-family and duplex units shall provide offsets forward from the garage.

(4)    A Type B landscape screen shall be required along the frontage of the PRD where the PRD intersects a collector, arterial or other residential street. 

(5)    Ensure that the primary frontage of new development includes inviting and appropriate landscaping from the public way or courtyard that complements the structure. 

(h)    The PRD must include and improve 10 percent of the site (excluding critical areas and buffers or areas of the site encumbered by existing easement(s) that will remain) with two or more common amenities including but not limited to:

(1)    Usable open space area for parks and recreation including play areas, sport courts, trails, gazebos, covered shelters, picnic tables and benches; 

(2)    Landscaped entries into the project; and

(3)    Protection of unique features. The PRD shall preserve unique natural site amenities, including significant trees or significant stands of trees as defined in Chapter 14.08, unusual rock outcroppings, ravines and ponds; wherever possible, outside of easements, critical areas and associated buffers. The trees retained shall only include healthy evergreen trees that have a high likelihood of withstanding windthrow. (Ord. 1069 § 5, 2020)


14.18.310 Cluster Subdivisions.

(a)    In any single-family residential zoning district, a developer may create lots that are smaller than those required by Section 14.48.010 if such developer complies with the provisions of this section.

(b)    The subdivision must result in six lots or more. 

(c)    The intent of this section is to authorize a decrease in lot sizes and leave the land “saved” by so doing as usable open space, thereby lowering development costs and increasing the amenity of the project without increasing the density beyond what would be permissible if the land were subdivided into the size of lots required by Chapter 14.48.

(1)    Lot sizes and lot widths may be reduced by up to a maximum of 20 percent of the dimensional standards for the underlying zoning districts per Table 14.48-I, provided no lot is less than 3,600 square feet in area or 40 feet in lot width.

(d)    The amount of usable open space that must be set aside shall be determined by:

(1)    Subtracting from the standard square footage requirement set forth in Table 14.48-I the amount of square footage of each lot that is smaller than that standard;

(2)    Adding together the results obtained in subsection (d)(1) of this section for each lot.

(e)    Common open space tracts created by clustering shall be located and configured in the manner that best connects and increases the usability of the open space within the subdivision, and satisfies the definition of usable open space per Table 14.48-I. The usable open space must be large enough to provide functional leisure or recreational activity and may be comprised of more than one tract; however, at least one open space tract shall be a minimum of 7,200 square feet. For cluster subdivisions in the R8-12 zoning district one open space tract shall be a minimum of 2,400 square feet. 

(f)    The setback requirements of Table 14.48-I shall apply in cluster subdivisions. (Ord. 1069 § 5, 2020)


14.18.320 Unit Lot Subdivisions.

(a)    The primary purpose of these provisions is to allow for the creation of fee simple unit lots for townhouse dwellings and duplexes, while applying only those site development standards applicable to the parent site as a whole. 

(b)    The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards of this title based on analysis of the individual unit lot, except that any private open space for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same lot as the dwelling unit it serves.

(c)    Unit lot subdivisions and subsequent platting actions, additions or modifications to the structure(s) may not create or increase any nonconformity of the parent lot.

(d)    Private access drives are allowed to provide access to dwellings and off-street parking areas within a unit lot subdivision. Access, joint use and maintenance agreements shall be executed for use of common garage or parking areas, common open area and other similar features, as recorded with Snohomish County.

(e)    Within the parent lot, required parking for a dwelling unit may be provided on a different unit lot or tract other than the lot with the dwelling unit, if the right to use that parking is formalized by an easement or otherwise defined on the final plat, as recorded with Snohomish County.

(f)    The facts that the unit lot is not a separate buildable lot and that additional development of the individual unit lots may be limited as a result of the application of development standards to the parent lot shall be noted on the plat, as recorded with Snohomish County. (Ord. 1069 § 5, 2020)

14.32.060    Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Uses


14.32.010 Continuation of Nonconforming Situations and Completion of Nonconforming Projects.

Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter may be continued subject to the restrictions and qualifications of this chapter and, if applicable, of an adopted subarea plan. (Ord. 876, Sec. 15, 2012)


14.32.020 Nonconforming Lots.

(a)    This section applies only to legal nonconforming lots which have no substantial structures upon it.

(b)    A lot that is nonconforming by virtue of not meeting the minimum lot area required for the zone in which it is located may be used the same as if it were conforming, except that any use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone (e.g., a two-family residence) is prohibited.


14.32.030 Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations.

(a)    No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of a nonconformity, except as specified below. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in:

(1)    An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use, or

(2)    Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations, parking or density requirements.

(b)    A legal nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.

(c)    A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if 10 percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the date on which it became nonconforming and where the proposed expansion conforms to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations concerning the use.

(d)    The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other subsections of this section occur.

(e)    Any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements.

(f)    Whenever: (1) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it, and (2) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (3) the additional parking or loading spaces required by Chapter 14.72 cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot, then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land. (Ord. 676, Sec. 21, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.32.040 Repair, Maintenance and Reconstruction.

(a)    Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are allowed. Major renovation and repairs, i.e., work valued at more than 25 percent of the appraised valuation of the structure, may be done only in accordance with required permits issued pursuant to this section.

(b)    If a structure housing a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, accident or natural disaster to an extent that the value of repair or replacement would exceed 50 percent of the appraised valuation of the structure prior to the fire, accident or natural disaster, then the nonconforming use shall not be re-established. This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a building permit.

(c)    For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section:

(1)    The “value” of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement.

(2)    No person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections (a) or (b) of this section by doing such work incrementally.

(3)    The “appraised valuation” shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser.

(d)    The Planning Director shall issue a permit authorized by subsection (a) of this section if it is found that, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work:

(1)    This proposal meets the requirements of this chapter; and

(2)    The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this title applicable to the proposal.

Compliance with a requirement of this title is not reasonably possible if it cannot be achieved without adding land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. That an applicant is facing financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. (Ord. 811, Sec. 23, 2010)


14.32.050 Change in Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists.

(a)    A change in use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) that requires a new Planning Director approval, administrative conditional use, or conditional use permit in accordance with Section 14.16C.030 may not be made except in accordance with subsections (b) through (d) of this section.

(b)    If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this title applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this title is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status.

(c)    If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this title applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the permitting entity issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if it is found that:

(1)    The proposal meets the requirements of this chapter; and

(2)    All of the applicable requirements of this title that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this title is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. That an applicant is facing financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. In no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created.

(d)    No change in use to another use that is not permissible in the district in which it is located shall be allowed. (Ord. 811, Sec. 24, 2010)


14.32.060 Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Uses.

(a)    When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, subsequent uses on the property must be permitted in the zone in which the property is located. (Ord. 676, Sec. 21, 2003; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)

14.36.010 Residential Districts Established.

(a)    The following residential districts are hereby established: R4, WR, R6, R8-12, MFR. Each of these districts is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in nonresidential districts. Other objectives of some of these districts are explained in the remainder of this section.

(1)    R4 - Four Dwellings per Acre. The R4 Single-Family district is designed primarily to accommodate single-family detached residential uses and at medium densities of four to five dwelling units per net buildable acre with the potential of some density bonuses. Some types of attached and accessory residences may be allowed.

(2)    The Waterfront Residential district (WR-4) is designed primarily to accommodate single-family detached residential uses at medium densities in areas adjacent to Lake Stevens and served by public water and sewer facilities.

(3)    R6 - Six Dwellings per Acre. The R6 Single-Family district is designed primarily to accommodate single-family detached residential uses at medium densities of six to seven dwelling units per net buildable acre with the potential of some density bonuses. Some types of attached and accessory residences may be allowed.

(4)    R8-12 - Eight to 12 Dwellings per Acre. The R8-12 Residential zone is intended to achieve development densities of eight to 12 dwelling units per net buildable acre with the potential of some density bonuses. This zone allows for the development of single-family detached dwellings and attached townhomes.

(5)    Multi-Family Residential district is designed to accommodate attached residential uses at a minimum of 15 units per net buildable acre or more in areas served by public water and sewer facilities. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 4, 2020; Ord. 811, Sec. 25, 2010; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.36.020 Commercial Districts Established.

(a)    The following commercial districts are hereby established: Business district, Commercial district, Central Business district, Local Business zone, and Planned Business district. These districts are created to accomplish the purposes and serve the objectives set forth in the remainder of this section.

(b)    The Central Business district (CBD) is designed to accommodate a wide variety of commercial activities (particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented) that will result in the most intensive and attractive use of the City’s Central Business district.

(c)    The Local Business (LB) zone is designed to accommodate commercial development along arterials to cater to commuters, or as a transition in some areas between a higher intensity zone (e.g., commercial, industrial, etc.) and a lower intensity zone (e.g., residential, park, etc.), or may provide for a smaller scale shopping center that primarily serves one neighborhood or area of the City.

(d)    The Planned Business district (PBD) is designed to accommodate commercial or mixed use development, including supporting residential structures, generally similar to the types permissible in a Central Business district or Mixed Use zone. It is intended that this zone be used on sites containing sensitive resources or other sites where, due to property-specific circumstances, detailed planning would benefit all property owners involved as well as the public by, among other things, allowing for comprehensive site planning and a transfer of densities among parcels in order to avoid impacts to sensitive resources.

(e)    The Business district (BD) is designed to promote community and regional employment and accommodate land uses such as corporate offices, general offices, research and development, medical clinics, public and civic uses, technology, and light manufacturing and assembly. This district should be located in areas with direct access to highways and arterials in addition to transit facilities, adequate public services and traffic capacity.

(f)    The Commercial district (CD) is designed to accommodate the high intensity retail needs of the community and regional market by attracting a mix of large to small format retail stores and restaurants to create a vibrant and unified regional shopping center. Transportation accessibility, exposure to highways and arterials with adequate public services and traffic capacity characterize this district. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 4, 2020; Ord. 876, Sec. 16, 2012; Ord. 811, Sec. 26, 2010; Ord. 744, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.36.025 Mixed Use Districts.

(a)    The following Mixed Use districts are hereby established: Mixed Use (MU) and Mixed Use Neighborhood (MUN), to accommodate a mix of commercial and residential units at different intensities in transitional areas between commercial and residential areas.

(b)    The Mixed Use (MU) zone is designed to primarily accommodate a horizontally stratified mixture of residential and commercial uses. It is intended that this zoning classification be applied primarily as a transition or buffer zone between Commercial or Multi-Family zones and Residential districts.

(c)    The Mixed Use Neighborhood (MUN) zone is designed to accommodate higher density residential development in proximity to employment and retail centers and provide basic convenience goods and services in areas with available public services and adequate traffic capacities. This district would have a minimum density of 15 dwelling units per acre and create a transition between higher and lower intensity land uses. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 4, 2020)


14.36.030 Industrial Districts Established.

The following districts are hereby established primarily to accommodate enterprises engaged in the manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing, renovating, painting, cleaning, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment: Light Industrial and General Industrial. The performance standards set forth in Part 1 of Chapter 14.44 place limitations on the characteristics of uses located in these districts. The limitations in the Light Industrial district are more restrictive than those in the General Industrial district. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 4, 2020; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.36.034 Public/Semi-Public District Established.

A Public/Semi-Public district is hereby established to accommodate public and semi-public uses, such as schools, government services and facilities, public utilities, community facilities, parks, etc., on publicly owned land. (Ord. 501, Sec. 6, 1995)


14.36.040 Planned Neighborhood Development Districts Established.

Repealed by Ord. 1080. (Ord. 811, Sec. 27, 2010; Ord. 737, Sec. 3, 2006; Ord. 676, Sec. 22, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.36.050 Floodplain and Floodway Districts.

The floodplain and floodway districts are hereby established as “overlay” districts, meaning that these districts are overlaid upon other districts and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying district only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district. The floodplain and floodway districts are further described in Chapter 14.64.


14.36.060 Shoreline Environment Designation.

The shoreline environment designation is hereby established as an “overlay” district, meaning that these districts are overlaid upon other districts and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying district only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district and a shoreline development permit has been granted, if necessary, pursuant to the Shoreline Master Program, where this district is further described.

(viii)    The proposal is not an essential public facility as defined by RCW 36.70A.200(1) and Section 14.16C.060, except as permitted by Chapter 43.21C RCW. 

(2)    The City shall base its decision on review of a SEPA checklist, or an alternative form, adopted pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW, and review of the application and supporting documentation.

(f)    Effect of Planned Action.

(1)    Upon determination by the SEPA Responsible Official that the proposal qualifies as a planned action, in accordance with this chapter, the proposal shall not require a SEPA threshold determination or be subject to further environmental review pursuant to SEPA.

(i)    Following this determination, the City will provide the applicant with written certification that their project qualifies as a planned action project and that it is subject to the final conditions of project approval.

(2)    Projects that create a substantial change in the type or degree of impacts analyzed in the planned action EIS would not qualify as a planned action.

(3)    Should environmental conditions change significantly from those analyzed in the planned action EIS, the SEPA Responsible Official may determine that the planned action designation is not applicable until:

(i)    The applicant provides supplemental environmental review limited to those issues and environmental impacts not previously addressed or that are inconsistent with the planned action EIS; or 

(ii)    The applicant undergoes a separate SEPA review consistent with the City’s SEPA regulations and the requirements of state law. 

(g)    Monitoring and Review.

(1)    The City will monitor development progress in the designated planned action area to ensure it is consistent with the applicable planned action EIS regarding the type and amount of development and associated impacts, and with the mitigation measures and improvements planned for the individual subareas.

(2)    The SEPA Responsible Official shall review the planned action ordinance no later than five years from its effective date to determine the continuing relevance of its assumptions and findings with respect to environmental conditions in the planned action areas, the probable impacts of development, and required mitigation measures. Based on this review, the City may amend, addend, or supplement the planned action ordinance and/or EIS.

(3)    If, during monitoring, a project proposal, within the planned action area, is nearing the development thresholds or full build-out capacity identified in the planned action EIS, the SEPA Responsible Official shall determine if the planned action ordinance and/or EIS warrant amendments, addenda, or supplemental analysis.

14.40.090    More Specific Use Controls


14.40.010 Table of Permissible Uses.

Table 14.40-I, the Table of Permissible Uses, sets forth the permissible uses for the various zoning districts in the City, subject to other applicable provisions in this title. It should be read in close conjunction with the definitions of terms set forth in Section 14.08.010 and the other interpretative provisions set forth in this chapter. Permissible uses for the subarea zoning districts are not included in this table, but are included in Section 14.38.020. (Ord. 876, Sec. 18, 2012; Ord. 811, Sec. 31, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 23, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.020 Use of the Designations P, A, C in Table of Permissible Uses.

(a)    The Table of Permissible Uses (Table 14.40-I) sets forth which uses are permitted in which zones. The letter “P” means the use is permitted or allowed in the indicated zone district subject to all code requirements of this title. The letter “A” means the use requires an administrative conditional use permit, and the letter “C” means the use requires a conditional use permit. No letter means that use is not permitted in the indicated zone district.

(b)    When used in connection with residential uses (use classification 1.000), the designation “PAC” means that such developments of less than five dwelling units are a permitted use when code requirements are met, developments of five or more but less than 13 dwelling units need an administrative conditional use permit, and developments of 13 or more dwelling units require a conditional use permit.

(c)    When used in connection with nonresidential uses, the designation “PA” means that such developments are permitted if the lot to be developed is less than one acre in size and require an administrative conditional use permit if the lot is one acre or larger in area; and the designation “PC” means that such developments are permitted if the lot to be developed is less than one acre in size and require a conditional use permit if the lot is one acre or larger in area.

(d)    Use of the designation PAC for combination uses is explained in Section 14.40.080. (Ord. 903, Sec. 29, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 32, 2010; Ord. 798, Sec. 3, 2009; Ord. 676, Sec. 24, 2003; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.030 Jurisdiction over Uses Otherwise Permissible.

Whenever this title provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible, an administrative conditional use permit shall nevertheless be required if the Planning Director finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. In making this determination, the Planning Director shall consider, among other factors, whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot, whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another, whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties, and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question. (Ord. 811, Sec. 33, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 25, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.040 Permissible and Prohibited Uses.

(a)    The presumption established by this title is that all legitimate uses of land are addressed within the Table of Permissible Uses, and are either allowed or not allowed thereby. But because the list of permissible uses set forth at the end of this chapter cannot be all inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses.

(b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts:

(1)    Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the City’s fire prevention code.

(2)    Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants.

(3)    Use of a travel trailer, motor home, or other recreational vehicle as a permanent residence except those permitted in a manufactured/mobile home park as per Section 14.44.070. Recreational vehicles may be used as a temporary guest residence for up to two weeks without a permit, or up to three months within any one consecutive year upon approval by the Planning Director. Situations that do not comply with this subsection on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title are required to conform within one year.

(4)    Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold or stored, any services are performed, or other business is conducted. This prohibition does not apply to temporary public services, such as bookmobiles, blood donation centers, public service information, etc., or temporary food vendors allowed pursuant to Sections 14.44.400 and 14.44.410 (situations that do not comply with this subsection on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title are required to conform within 30 days).

(5)    Repealed by Ord. 958.

(6)    Sewage/septic sludge recycling except when approved as an essential public facility pursuant to Section 14.16C.060. (Ord. 991, Sec. 5, 2017; Ord. 958, Sec. 2, 2016; Ord. 903, Sec. 30, 2013; Ord. 894, Sec. 2, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 34, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 26, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.050 Accessory Uses.

(a)    The Table of Permissible Uses (referenced in Section 14.40.010 and found at the end of this chapter) classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then it may be regarded as accessory to the principal use, and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require an administrative conditional use permit (use classification 6.210).

(b)    For purposes of interpreting subsection (a) of this section:

(1)    A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use;

(2)    To be “commonly associated” with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness.

(c)    Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the following activities, so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above, are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses:

(1)    Home occupations.

(2)    Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature.

(3)    The renting out of one or two rooms within a single-family residence (which one or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit) other than on a daily or weekly basis to not more than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling.

(4)    Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three days (whether consecutive or not) during any 30-day period.

(d)    Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts.

(1)    Storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of more than one motor vehicle that is unlicensed and nonoperational for a period of more than three months.

(2)    Parking outside a substantially enclosed structure or a vehicle accommodation area of more than four motor vehicles between the building setback of the principal building and the street on any lot used for purposes that fall within the following principal use classifications: 1.100, 1.200, or 1.400.

(e)    When a land use permit is applied for, all anticipated accessory uses shall be explicitly disclosed, and made part of the findings. Subsequent accessory uses not disclosed shall be subject to the permit modification requirements of Section 14.16A.235 prior to commencing. (Ord. 811, Sec. 35, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 27, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.060 Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, no land use approval, administrative conditional use, or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses:

(1)    Streets.

(2)    Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way.

(3)    Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the permission of the owner (State or town) of the right-of-way. (Ord. 811, Sec. 36, 2010)


14.40.070 Change in Use.

A change of use of property shall be reviewed pursuant to Section 14.16C.030. (Ord. 811, Sec. 37, 2010; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.080 Combination Uses.

(a)    When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits (permitted use, administrative conditional use, or conditional use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:

(1)    A conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit.

(2)    An administrative conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires an administrative conditional use permit but none requires a conditional use permit.

(3)    A permitted use requiring Planning Director approval in all other cases. This is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation PAC in a column.

(b)    When a combination use consists of a single-family detached residential subdivision and two-family or multifamily uses, the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot.

(c)    When a combination use consists of a single-family detached and two-family or multifamily uses, then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit specified in Section 14.48.020. (Ord. 811, Sec. 38, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 28, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.40.090 More Specific Use Controls.

Whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses (referenced in Section 14.40.010 and found at the end of this chapter), the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor’s office or clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However, classification 3.130, “office or clinics of physicians or dentists with not more than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area,” more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling. (Ord. 1020, Sec. 3, 2018; Ord. 468, 1995)

14.44.090 Planned Business District.

(a)    The Planned Business District is designed to accommodate commercial or mixed use development on sites containing sensitive resources or other sites where, due to property-specific circumstances, detailed planning would benefit all property owners involved as well as the public by allowing for comprehensive site planning and a transfer of densities among parcels in order to avoid impacts to sensitive resources.

(b)    Development of all contiguous properties within a Planned Business District shall be in conformance with a master development plan developed for each of the Planned Business Districts in conformance with subsection (g) of this section. A master development plan is an area plan adopted by the City Council, which includes single and/or multiple ownerships of parcel(s) that relate through common objectives and design elements. The boundaries of the master development plan shall be an area generally delineated by principal/intermediate/minor arterial/collector streets within the PBD Zone.

(c)    The master development plan shall not create a contract or be considered as absolutely binding upon the City or adjacent owners as to future development of adjacent land (unless so specified in a separate development agreement), but shall be used as a guide to landowners, developers, and the City.

(d)    If a master development plan has not been adopted, property owners may request grading or building permits for existing or accessory structures. No new residential structures are allowed unless allowed as a permissible use pursuant to Chapter 14.40.

(e)    The master development plan for any Planned Business District may be developed either by an applicant or group of applicants working collectively or by the City. However, the City is not obligated to do so.

(f)    The master development plan shall be processed (and amended) as a conditional use permit. However, once a master development plan is adopted for a Planned Business District, all subsequent individual permitted uses shall be permitted through a site plan review and subsequent building permits and shall be consistent with the master development plan.

(g)    Master development plans shall address the following:

(1)    Site Design. A site plan for the entire Planned Business District shall be developed, indicating where the various land uses and the below listed elements will be located.

(2)    Permitted Uses. Individual residential uses consistent with Table 14.40-I may be allowed when:

(i)    An economic analysis is submitted with the master development plan application, supporting the change or mix of commercial and/or nonresidential uses and the increased need for residential development within the immediate area of the Planned Business District. The analysis, at a minimum, shall demonstrate that the potential commercial components being replaced by residential uses do not diminish the City’s overall economic viability as set forth in the goals, policies, and strategies of the Comprehensive Plan; and

(ii)    The uses proposed in the master development plan include at least five percent commercial and/or civic uses based on the total square footage of the use structure. If the exact residential square footage is not known at the time of application for the master development plan, the applicant may use 1,500 per residential unit square footage factor to calculate the required commercial and/or civic use component; and

(iii)    The residential development is proposed at a minimum of three dwelling units per acre on the site area allocated to the residential uses. A single-family residence may be permitted on sites where the property qualifies for a reasonable use provision pursuant to Sections 14.88.900 through 14.88.950. Development rights only shall be calculated using a base of three dwelling units per acre and may only be transferred to other sites within the same PBD master development plan area; and

(iv)    Multifamily apartments shall be limited to 75 percent of the total residential uses on site. This provision does not apply to mixed use structures.

(3)    Transportation and Circulation. The layout and design of all streets, rights-of-way, parking, ingress and egress, and mass transit facilities for the entire Planned Business District shall be provided.

(5)    Recreational and Cultural Facilities. At least 10 percent of the portions of a Planned Business District that are not within sensitive areas or buffers shall be developed as usable open space. Such open space may be comprised of park space, public or private porches and patios, public trails, art facilities, or other similar uses which are intended to provide opportunities for recreational, cultural, or personal experiences.

(6)    Critical Areas. All critical areas shall be identified and protected in conformance with Chapter 14.88 (Critical Areas). A protection and mitigation program for the entire site may be developed; provided, that mitigation for approved impacts shall be required at the time of the impact, regardless of whether the impact is located on the same parcel as the mitigation.

(7)    Design. A master design concept shall be developed in conformance with the City’s development design guidelines, addressing architecture, massing, signage, streetscape, street furniture, etc. All development within the Planned Business District shall then need to conform to the design concept. Innovative design concepts may be considered and approved pursuant to the design review process in Section 14.16C.050(f), when the applicant demonstrates the overall design complies with the City’s Comprehensive Plan goals and policies. Design concepts and requirements may be administered through the master development plan and subsequent site plan review.

Part III.    Manufacturing/Processing Performance Standards


14.44.200 	[Intentionally Blank]


14.44.210 Noise.

(a)    No 4.000 classification use in any permissible business district may generate noise that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon (1) uses located outside the immediate space occupied by the 4.000 use if that use is one of several located on a lot, or (2) uses located on adjacent lots.

(b)    Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the table set forth in subsection (e) of this section establishes the maximum permissible noise levels for 4.000 classification uses in the Light Industrial and General Industrial districts. Measurements shall be taken at the boundary line of the lot where the 4.000 classification use is located, and, as indicated, the maximum permissible noise levels vary according to the zoning of the lot adjacent to the lot on which the 4.000 classification use is located.

(c)    A decibel is a measure of a unit of sound pressure. Since sound waves having the same decibel level “sound” louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles per second (i.e., whether the pitch of the sound is high or low) an A-weighted filter constructed in accordance with the specifications of the American National Standards Institute, which automatically takes account of the varying effect on the human ear of different pitches, shall be used on any sound level meter taking measurements required by this section. And accordingly, all measurements are expressed in dB(A) to reflect the use of this A-weighted filter.

(d)    The standards established in the table set forth in subsection (e) of this section are expressed in terms of the equivalent sound level (Leq), which must be calculated by taking 100 instantaneous A-weighted sound levels at 10-second intervals (see the administrative guideline entitled “Guide for Noise Levels,” Section F-1) and computing the Leq in accordance with the table set forth in the administrative guideline entitled “Guide for Noise Levels,” Section F-2.

(e)    Table 14.44-I: Maximum Permitted Sound Levels, dB(A).

 

Table 14.44-I: Maximum Permitted Sound Levels, dB(A)  

	Zoning of Lot Where 4.000 Use Located	(re: 0.0002 Microbar) Zoning of Adjacent Land

	Residential and PND	NC, LB, CBD, MU, PBD, SRC	LI	GI

	7:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m.	9:00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m.

	LI & GI	60	50	65	70	70

(f)    Impact noises generated by sources that do not operate more than one minute in any one-hour period are permissible up to a level of 10 dB(A) in excess of the figures listed in subsection (e) of this section, except that this higher level of permissible noise shall not apply from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. when the adjacent lot is zoned residential. The impact noise shall be measured using the fast response of the sound level meter.

(g)    Noise resulting from temporary construction activity that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. (Ord. 811, Sec. 46, 2010; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.44.220 Vibration.

(a)    No 4.000 classification use in any permissible business district may generate any ground-transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the human sense of touch measured at (1) the outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the vibration if the enterprise is one of several located on a lot, or (2) the lot line if the enterprise generating the vibration is the only enterprise located on a lot.

(b)    No 4.000 classification use in a Light Industrial or General Industrial district may generate any ground-transmitted vibration in excess of the limits set forth in subsection (e) of this section. Vibration shall be measured at any adjacent lot line or residential district line as indicated in the table set forth in subsection (d) of this section.

(c)    The instrument used to measure vibrations shall be a three-component measuring system capable of simultaneous measurement of vibration in three mutually perpendicular directions.

(d)    The vibration maximums set forth in subsection (e) of this section are stated in terms of particle velocity, which may be measured directly with suitable instrumentation or computed on the basis of displacement and frequency.

    When computed, the following formula shall be used:

PV = 6.28 F x D

    Where:

	PV =	Particle velocity, inches-per-second

	F =	Vibration frequency, cycles-per-second

	D =	Single amplitude displacement of the vibration, inches.

    The maximum velocity shall be the vector sum of the three components recorded.

(e)    Table 14.44-II: Table of Maximum Ground-Transmitted Vibration.

Table 14.44-II: Maximum Ground-Transmitted Vibration 

	Zoning District	Particle Velocity, Inches-Per-Second

	Adjacent Lot Line	Residential District

	M-1	0.10	0.02

	M-2	0.20	0.02

(f)    The values stated in subsection (e) of this section may be multiplied by two for impact vibrations, i.e., discrete vibration pulsations not exceeding one second in duration and having a pause of at least one second between pulses.

(g)    Vibrations resulting from temporary construction activity that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. (Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010)


14.44.230 Odors.

(a)    For purposes of this section, the “odor threshold” is defined as the minimum concentration in air of a gas, vapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of five healthy observers.

(b)    No 4.000 classification use in any district may generate any odor that reaches the odor threshold, measured at:

(1)    The outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the odor.

(2)    The lot line if the enterprise generating the odor is the only enterprise located on a lot.


14.44.240 Smoke and Air Pollution.

(a)    Any 4.000 classification use that emits any “air contaminant” as defined in Regulations 1, 2, or 3 of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency shall comply with applicable state standards concerning air pollution, as set forth in Regulations 1, 2, or 3 of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.

(b)    No Planning Director approval, administrative conditional use, or conditional use permit may be issued with respect to any development covered by subsection (a) of this section until the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency has certified to the permit-issuing authority that the appropriate state permits have been received by the developer, or that the developer will be eligible to receive such permits and that the development is otherwise in compliance with applicable air pollution laws.

(Ord. 903, Sec. 35, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 47, 2010).


14.44.250 Disposal of Liquid and Hazardous Wastes.

(a)    No 4.000 classification use in any district may discharge any waste contrary to the provisions of Chapter 70.105 RCW (Hazardous Waste Management) or Chapter 90.48 RCW (Water Pollution Control).

(b)    No 4.000 classification use in any district may discharge into the City sewage treatment facilities any waste that cannot be adequately treated by biological means.


14.44.260 Water Consumption.

No 4.000 classification use shall consume and/or use water supplied by the Snohomish County Public Utility District No. 1 in a manner inconsistent with the requirements and water service policies of the Snohomish County Public Utility District No. 1.


14.44.270 Electrical Disturbance or Interference.

No 4.000 classification use may:

(a)    Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment other than those of the creator of such disturbance; or

(b)    Otherwise cause, create, or contribute to the interference with electronic signals (including television and radio broadcasting transmissions) to the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator of such disturbance is adversely affected.

Part II.    Cottage Housing Development Standards


14.46.100 Purpose and Intent. 

(a)    These regulations set forth the required standards for cottage housing developments as permissible uses in the following zoning districts: R6, R8-12 and MFR.

(b)    Cottage housing allows for a higher density development than is normally allowed. This is made possible by smaller home sizes, clustered home sites, and parking and design standards. 

(c)    The intent of the cottage housing development regulations is to:

(1)    Support the growth management goal of more efficient use of urban residential land;

(2)    Support development of diverse housing in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan;

(3)    Increase the variety of housing types available for smaller households;

(4)    Provide opportunities for small, detached dwelling units within existing neighborhoods; and 

(5)    Provide opportunities for creative, diverse and high quality infill development that is compatible with existing neighborhoods. (Ord. 1081, Sec. 4, 2020; Ord. 798, Sec. 7 (Exh. 2), 2009)


14.46.105 Existing Dwellings.

An existing detached single-family dwelling that is incorporated into a cottage housing development as a residence and is nonconforming with respect to the standards of this chapter shall be permitted to remain on a site used for a cottage housing development and shall count as one of the allowed units. However, the extent of the noncompliance may not be increased unless the proposed change is determined by the Director to be consistent in character, scale and design with the cottage housing development. Repair, maintenance and reconstruction of an existing dwelling are regulated by Section 14.32.040. An existing dwelling may be replaced with cottage units consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 798, Sec. 7 (Exh. 2), 2009)


14.46.110 Density Standards.

The following density standards shall apply to cottage housing developments:

(a)    Cottages may be built at up to two units per single-family home allowed in the underlying zone. 

(b)    Existing single-family dwellings will count towards total units. 

(c)    Minimum units per cluster: four.

(d)    Maximum units per cluster: 12.

(e)    Maximum units per cottage housing development: 24.

(f)    Cottage housing developments are required to be a minimum of 500 feet from another cottage housing development. 

(g)    Carriage house units may be built on top of a common garage, when the garage is located adjacent to the common open area. No more than 25 percent of the total number of units may be located above a common garage. (Ord. 798, Sec. 7 (Exh. 2), 2009)


14.46.115 Community Assets.

(a)    Common Open Area. The minimum common open area requirements set forth in this section are intended to provide a sense of openness, visual relief, and community in cottage housing developments. Common open areas shall provide a centrally located, focal area for the cottage housing development. 

(1)    At least 400 square feet of common open area per cottage is required for each cluster.

(2)    Required common open area may be divided into no more than two separate areas per cluster. 

(3)    To be considered as part of the minimum open space requirement, an area of common open area must have a minimum dimension of 35 feet on all sides. 

(4)    At least two sides of the common open area shall have cottages along the perimeter.

(5)    Parking areas, yard setbacks, private open space, and driveways do not qualify as common open area. Community buildings can be counted towards the common open area calculations.

Multifamily impact fee rates shall apply to cottage housing developments. (Ord. 798, Sec. 7 (Exh. 2), 2009)


14.46.125 Access and Parking.

The intent of these access and parking standards is to minimize the visual impact of vehicles and parking areas for residents of the cottage housing development and adjacent properties and to provide for adequate off-street parking for cottage housing developments. It is the intent that shared detached garage structures be used for parking of vehicles used by the residents. 

(a)    Access. Access to a cottage housing development shall be consistent with Chapter 14.72 and Section 14.56.180. 

(b)    Minimum Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces.

(1)    Minimum parking spaces requirement, including garage spaces and guest parking, shall be two per dwelling unit. 

 (2)    Parking for a maximum of one vehicle per cottage shall be in a shared detached garage, provided the parking structure is adjacent to other parking spaces. Shared detached garage structures shall be reserved for the parking of vehicles owned by the residents of the development. Storage of items which preclude the use of the parking spaces for vehicles is prohibited. 

 (3)    Guest parking may be clustered with resident parking and shall include clear signage identifying them as reserved for visitors. 

(c)    Parking Design. The intent of these parking design standards is to create unobtrusive parking, by screening and disguising parking structures and spaces from surrounding properties, including screening by architectural design and/or vegetation, and by minimizing the number of contiguous spaces. 

(1)    Parking areas or common garages shall be limited to no more than four contiguous spaces separated by a minimum of five feet of sidewalk, landscaping, or open space. The number of continuous parking garages or spaces shall be minimized. 



(2)    Shared detached garage structures may not exceed four garage doors per building and a total of 1,200 square feet. 

(3)    Parking shall be separated from the common open area, adjacent properties, and public streets by landscaping and/or architectural screening. Solid board fencing shall not be allowed as an architectural screen. Exception: One parking structure may be adjacent to the common open area, if carriage house units are placed on top and the garage includes architectural features to make it look consistent with the units and community assets. 

(4)    Parking shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from a public street. 

(5)    The parking layout shall be designed to minimize walking distance to cottages. 

(6)    A pitched roof is required for all parking structures. 

(7)    The design of garages and carports, including roof lines, shall be similar to and compatible with that of the dwelling units within the cottage housing development. 

(8)    Common garages are allowed, if locked storage space is provided for each unit in the garage or community building. 

(9)    Parking may be located between or adjacent to structures, if it is located toward the rear of the structure and is served by an alley or driveway. (Ord. 798, Sec. 7 (Exh. 2), 2009)

14.46.135 Storage.

(a)    Storage closets for each unit may be included as part of community buildings or added to garages. 

(b)    Storage for gardening supplies may be included as part of a community building or a separate small building designed to mimic the units. 

(c)    Garages shall not be used for storage except in addition to the parking of one owner’s vehicle. (Ord. 798, Sec. 7 (Exh. 2), 2009)


14.46.140 Design Standards.

(a)    Cottage Size. The intent of setting a unit size is to ensure the overall size of cottages remains smaller and causes less visual impact than standard sized single-family dwellings, particularly given the increased density of cottage dwellings, and to provide variety in cottage housing developments through a mixture of building sizes and footprints. 

(1)    The total floor area of each cottage shall not exceed 1,500 square feet. No more than 25 percent of the total number of units shall be larger than 1,200 square feet. 

(2)    The footprint of each cottage shall not exceed 1,000 square feet. The total square foot area of a cottage dwelling unit may not be increased. A note shall be placed on the title to the property for the purpose of notifying future property owners that any increase in the total square footage of a cottage is prohibited for the life of the cottage or duration of City cottage housing development regulations. 

(3)    There shall be no minimum size requirements for the individual units, provided units meet the minimum livability standards as defined by Chapter 3 of the International Residential Code. 

(4)    The second floor area cannot exceed 75 percent of the first floor area. 

(5)    At least 25 percent of the cottages in each cluster shall have a gross floor area less than 1,000 square feet.

(ii)    Unheated storage space located under the main floor of the cottage; 

(iii)    Basements;

(iv)    Attached unenclosed porches;

(v)    Garages or carports; or

(vi)    Architectural projections (i.e., bay windows, fireplaces or utility closets) no greater than 24 inches in depth and six feet in width. 

(vii)    The director may approve other exemptions similar in nature provided the intent of this section is met. 

(7)    Plat or Plan Note Required. The total square footage of a cottage shall not be increased from its permitted size. A note shall be placed on the final plan or plat stating this limitation. 

(b)    Cottage Height and Roof Standards. The height of all units shall comply with Section 14.48.060, Building Height Limitations. In addition, the following standards shall apply to cottage housing developments and shall take precedence over conflicting standards in Section 14.48.060: 

(1)    A cottage shall have a gable roof or a hipped roof. A cottage shall not have a flat roof. Dormers are allowed. 

(2)    Maximum height of cottage units with a minimum roof slope of 6:12 shall be 25 feet, subject to all parts of the roof above 14 feet shall be pitched. 

(3)    Maximum height shall be 18 feet for cottages without a roof slope of 6:12 and for all accessory structures. 

(c)    Orientation of Cottages.

(1)    Each dwelling unit shall be oriented toward a common open area, and 65 percent of the units shall abut the common open area. 

(2)    Each cottage shall be within 60 feet walking distance of the common open area. 

(3)    Lots in a cottage housing development are not required to abut a public street.

(4)    Each unit abutting a public street (not including alleys) shall have a facade, secondary entrance, porch, bay window, or other architectural enhancement oriented to the public street. 

(5)    Cottages shall be placed with a minimum intervening space between buildings of 60 feet, measured foundation to foundation across the common open space. 

(d)    Cottage Setbacks.

(1)    The minimum setbacks between all structures (including cottages, parking structures and community buildings) in a cottage housing development shall be 10 feet. Eaves may project into the required setback up to 18 inches. 

(2)    The minimum cottage setback from interior roads in a cottage housing development shall be 15 feet. 

(3)    All other minimum setbacks for all structures (including cottages, parking structures, and community buildings) in a cottage housing development shall be as provided for in the standards for the zoning district in which the cottage housing development lot is located and shall be subject to the International Residential Code. 

(4)    No part of any structure in a cottage housing development (including but not limited to cottages, parking structures, and community buildings) shall be more than 150 feet, as measured by the shortest clear and open route, from legally compliant fire department vehicle access. 

(e)    Porches. The intent of this porch requirement is to create outdoor space in each cottage that is visually and physically connected to the common open area and to other cottages. 

(1)    Cottage units shall have an unenclosed, covered front primary entry and porch. The front porch shall be oriented toward a common open area. 

(2)    Covered porches shall have at least 80 square feet in area with no side shorter than eight feet.

Private open space is partly intended to enable diversity in landscape design. 

(g)    Basements. Cottages may have basements. 

(h)    Fencing and Screening. The intent of internal decorative fencing and screening is to delineate private yards and screen parking structures, community assets and unit walls. A cottage housing development shall internally be an open community sharing common areas. The intent of external fencing and screening is to conceal the higher density development from adjacent lower density land uses. 

(1)    Decorative fencing may be used for delineating private yards. 

(2)    Fencing or shrubbery may be used to screen parking areas, community assets, and unit walls. 

(3)    Fencing and shrubbery may not exceed 36 inches in height, except directly adjacent to a parking structure.

Part III.    Infill Development


14.46.200 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose of this section is to encourage the efficient development of underutilized residential parcels in areas that are primarily built out, where infill residential development should be encouraged. This section identifies conditions under which infill development is supported and relaxes certain development requirements to promote the efficient construction of infill development in appropriate areas of the City. (Ord. 1081, Sec. 5, 2020)


14.46.210 Applicability.

(a)    Eligibility Criteria. This chapter may be applied to development or redevelopment that meets all the following criteria:

(1)    The lot is within one of the following zoning districts: R4, R6 and R8-12.

(2)    Adjacent properties abutting at least 50 percent of the nonstreet perimeter of the subject property:

(i)    Are developed with single-family dwellings or higher intensity uses; or

(ii)    Are encumbered by critical areas and associated buffers near the boundary; or

(iii)    Are utility easements, such as the Everett Waterline or PUD power easement, that create a substantial break in development and/or redevelopment potential.

(3)    The subject property is at least 125 percent of the minimum lot size for the underlying zoning district up to a maximum of one acre, not including those lands encumbered by critical areas, their associated buffers, proposed dedications to the City and existing utility easements that will remain; and

(i)    If the infill development is made up of multiple parcels the maximum size shall be taken from the combined area of the parcels.

(4)    The development or redevelopment creates a minimum of one new lot or dwelling unit. (Ord. 1081, Sec. 5, 2020)


14.46.230 Infill Residential Standards.

(a)    All other provisions of this title that would apply to a non-infill project shall apply to infill development except as specifically modified by this chapter.

(b)    Infill Land Division Standards - Reduction in Dimensional Requirements for Infill Residential Development. Notwithstanding the dimensional development standard requirements found in the underlying residential zones of Chapter 14.48, property that is eligible for infill residential development pursuant to Section 14.46.210 shall be eligible for subdivision of land as follows:

(1)    Minimum Lot Area. Minimum lot area may be reduced by 20 percent of the minimum areas required in Chapter 14.48 for the underlying zone.

(2)    Minimum Lot Width. Minimum lot width may be reduced by 20 percent of the required minimum lot width of the underlying zone with no lots being narrower than 40 feet.

(3)    Developments that provide detached housing units 1,600 square feet or smaller shall be granted a 20 percent adjusted gross density bonus to the underlying zoning district.

(c)    Infill Development Standards. Properties eligible for infill residential development pursuant to Section 14.46.210 may apply these additional development standards, provided all required utility infrastructure, access requirements, and street elements can be accommodated in accordance with the City design and construction standards.

(1)    If the proposed project conforms to the average existing building lines or setbacks of adjoining structures, reduced front setbacks will be permitted. In no case shall front setbacks be reduced for a garage or carport.

(2)    Side setbacks for single-family units may be five feet per side.

(3)    Impervious Surface. Maximum impervious surfaces can be increased by five percent over that allowed in the underlying zone.

(4)    Parking. Attached dwelling units, with shared parking lots, located within a half mile of a transit center with one or less bedrooms will qualify for a reduced parking standard of one and one-half spaces required per unit.

(5)    Attached dwelling units of up to four units shall be allowed in single-family zones as infill development subject to the following lot size standards:

(i)    Duplex lots shall be 125 percent of the minimum lot size of the underlying zone.

(ii)    Triplex lots shall be 150 percent of the minimum lot size of the underlying zone.

(iii)    Fourplex lots shall be 175 percent of the minimum lot size of the underlying zone.

(iv)    Up to four units may be provided in a garden/courtyard apartment with a minimum of two units per structure on a single lot.

(d)    Infill Design Standards. Property that is eligible for infill residential development pursuant to Section 14.46.210 shall adhere to the following design requirements. While creativity and variation in architectural design are encouraged, the purpose of these requirements is to ensure compatibility of infill development with the character of nearby existing residential structures.

(1)    Building orientation on infill lots shall match the predominant orientation of other buildings along the street frontage to match the neighborhood character. Multiplexes may have one unit face the street to meet this design standard.

(2)    Parking. Infill developments shall comply with all parking standards pursuant to Chapter 14.72 except as specifically modified by this chapter.

(i)    Parking may be consolidated for infill projects. Parking lots can be attached to individual lots, in common easements or set aside in a separate tract.

(ii)    For single-family and townhome projects, the access and off-street parking shall be like the predominant character for existing development along the street frontage; however, a central parking lot at the rear or side of the development would be allowed.

(iii)    For stacked apartment style projects, the primary vehicular access and off-street parking are preferred to be located to the rear or side of the proposed structures.

(iv)    For garden/courtyard style apartments the parking must be on the side or rear of the development.

(3)    Landscaping shall be provided along the perimeter of the development and parking lots to soften the transition between new and existing dwelling units when the new dwellings are different than the adjacent existing land use.

(i)    Attached dwelling units, including townhomes, stacked apartments and garden/courtyards shall provide a Type B screen as described in Section 14.76.040.

(ii)    Detached single-family infill projects are exempt from buffer landscaping adjacent to other single-family zoning districts.

(4)    Integration with Natural Amenities. Natural amenities (views, mature trees, creeks, rock outcrops, and other similar features) should be preserved and integrated with the development to the maximum extent feasible. Clustering of lots/units and adjusting roadway configuration to integrate these features are encouraged to achieve these goals. Access and visibility to these natural amenities are encouraged.

(5)    Horizontal building facades longer than 25 feet, or the width of individual attached units, shall be treated to reduce building mass and visual bulk using elements described in the Lake Stevens Design Guidelines for blank wall treatments.

(6)    Attached dwelling units shall be design reviewed using the Multifamily Chapter of the Lake Stevens Design Guidelines.

(7)    Additional Requirements for Garden/Courtyard Apartments.

14.48.010 Minimum Lot Size Requirements.

Table 14.48-I indicates the basic minimum lot size required for each zone district, which shall apply to all created lots unless a reduction is otherwise allowed pursuant to a specific regulation contained elsewhere in this title. (Ord. 811, Sec. 55, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 43, 2003; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.48.020 Duplexes in Single-Family Zones.

Duplexes and two-family conversions in single-family zones shall be allowed on lots having at least 125 percent of the minimum square footage required for one dwelling unit on a lot in such district. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020; Ord. 1030, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 676, Sec. 44, 2003; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.48.030 Minimum Lot Widths.

(a)    No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so irregularly shaped that it would be impracticable to construct on it a building that:

(1)    Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district; and

(2)    Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district.

(b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, Table 14.48-I establishes minimum lot widths. The lot width shall be measured along a horizontal line between side lot lines measured at approximate right angles at the midway point between the front and rear lot lines.

(c)    No lot created after the effective date of this title that is less than the recommended width shall be entitled to a variance from any building setback requirement. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.48.035 Lot standards.

(a)    Corner lots situated at the intersection of two or more streets shall measure the front setback along the lot line abutting the right-of-way that best conforms to the pattern of existing site development on adjacent lots. Side setbacks along side streets are reduced to 10 feet.

(b)    Interior lots shall measure the front setback along the lot line abutting the right-of-way.


[IMAGE]


(c)    Panhandle/flag lots are lots accessed from the abutting right-of-way by a narrow access corridor of land within the same lot. Panhandle lots shall be allowed subject to the following requirements:

(1)    Panhandle lots shall meet setback and other dimensional standards, on the portion of the lot outside the panhandle, where the access corridor joins the wide portion of the lot. The area within the panhandle access corridor shall not be used to determine lot area, lot width, lot depth or impervious area for the lot.

(2)    The panhandle shall provide direct access to a paved public or private street. The access corridor shall maintain a minimum width of 15 feet, a minimum height clearance of 12 feet and meet the City’s engineering standards.

(3)    There shall not be more than two contiguous panhandle lots where the panhandles abut. In such cases the panhandles can be reduced to 10 feet per lot.

(4)    All requirements of the fire code shall be met, including access, turnarounds and sprinklers as applicable.

(5)    No buildings shall be erected within the panhandle access.


[IMAGE]


Typical configuration for panhandle lot. Setbacks and orientation can vary based on site conditions.

(d)    Through lots including lots with parallel or approximately parallel streets shall measure the front setback along the lot line abutting the right-of-way that best conforms to the pattern of existing site development on adjacent lots or that lot line which abuts a nonarterial street. The other lot line abutting a right-of-way shall be considered a rear yard.

(Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020)


14.48.040 Building Setback Requirements.

(a)    Table 14.48-I and Table 14.48-II set forth the minimum building and freestanding sign setbacks required from lot lines.

(1)    Setbacks from access easements and access tracts are considered lot line setbacks for the purpose of determining front setbacks.

(2)    As used in this section, the term “building” includes any substantial structure which by nature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to constitute a visual obstruction or generate activity similar to that usually associated with a building. It also includes any element that is substantially a part of the building, such as bay windows and chimneys, and not a mere appendage, such as a flagpole. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of determining setbacks the following structures are to be considered buildings:

(i)    Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs;

(ii)    Fences, walls, and hedges (see Chapter 14.52 for height and setback requirements).

(b)    Whenever a lot in a residential district abuts a nonresidential district, and its required setback is greater than that of the nonresidential lot, the nonresidentially zoned lot shall observe the more restrictive setback. Where a lot zoned General or Light Industrial shares a boundary with a residentially zoned lot, the setback for the industrial property along that common boundary shall be 30 feet.

(c)    All docks and other permissible overwater structures shall be set back pursuant to the Shoreline Master Program, Chapter 4, Section C.3. For the purposes of this section each property line extending into the lake shall be construed as extending at the same angle as the property line on shore. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020; Ord. 1063, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 38, 2013; Ord. 898, Sec. 7, 2013; Ord. 796, Sec. 8, 2009; Ord 666, Sec. 8, 2002; Ord. 612, Sec. 1, 1999; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.48.045 Accessory Structures.

(a)    In single-family residential zones, accessory structures must meet the following conditions:

(1)    The gross floor area of all accessory structures shall not exceed 200 square feet without a building permit;

(2)    The height of the accessory structure shall not exceed 12 feet without a building permit; and

(3)    The accessory structure shall be no closer to the front property line than the principal dwelling unit. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020)


14.48.050 Exceptions to Building Setback Requirements.

(a)    The following modifications to the setback requirements identified in Section 14.48.040 shall be allowed:

(1)    In all single-family residential zones, the building setbacks from the street of the underlying zone may be reduced by five feet for living portions of the principal house or open porches. This reduction does not apply to garages or carports.

(2)    Exterior mechanical equipment including air conditioners, heat pumps and similar may extend up to 32 inches into the required side setback provided emergency access is not impaired.  

(3)    Eaves and other minor architectural features may project into the required setback up to 18 inches. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020; Ord. 1063, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 39, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 56, 2010; Ord. 741, Sec. 7, 2007; Ord. 676, Sec. 45, 2003; Ord. 666, Sec. 9, 2002; Ord. 595, 1999; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.48.055 Maximum Impervious Surface.

Repealed by Ord. 1080. (Ord. 1069 § 7, 2020; Ord. 947, Sec. 2, 2015; Ord. 595, 1999)


14.48.060 Building Height Limitations.

(a)    For purposes of this section the height of a building shall be the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade along four points of the proposed building to the highest point of the building. The height of fences, walls, and hedges is as set forth in Chapter 14.52. The average finished grade shall be determined by first delineating the smallest square or rectangle which can enclose the building and then averaging the ground elevations taken at the midpoint of each side of the square or rectangle.

[IMAGE]


(b)    Building height limitations in the various zoning districts shall be as listed in Table 14.48-I and Table 14.48-II.

(c)    The following features are exempt from the district height limitations set forth in subsection (b) of this section, provided they conform to the standards contained in subsection (d) of this section:

(1)    Chimneys, church spires, elevator shafts, and similar structural appendages not intended as places of occupancy or storage;

(2)    Flagpoles and similar devices;

(3)    Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors, and similar equipment, fixtures, and devices.

(d)    The features listed in subsection (c) of this section are exempt from the height limitations set forth in subsection (b) of this section if they conform to the following requirements:

(1)    Not more than one-third of the total roof area may be consumed by such features.

(2)    The features described in subsection (c)(3) of this section must be set back from the edge of the roof a minimum distance of one foot for every foot by which such features extend above the roof surface of the principal building to which they are attached.

(3)    The permit-issuing authority may authorize or require that parapet walls be constructed (up to a height not exceeding that of the features screened) to shield the features listed in subsections (c)(1) and (3) of this section from view.

(e)    Towers and antennas which exceed the height limit of the zone district are allowed to the extent authorized in the Table of Permissible Uses, use classification 18.000. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020; Ord. 1063, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 676, Sec. 46, 2003; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)

14.48.080 Architecturally Integrated Subdivisions.

Repealed by Ordinance 579.


14.48.085 Density Calculation and Lot Size Averaging.

(a)    The density calculation for new residential developments and subdivisions shall be based on an adjusted gross density as follows, unless otherwise defined in this title:

(1)    Subtract the actual percentage of the area devoted to infrastructure and other encumbrances including but not limited to streets and stormwater, existing easements, utility corridors, etc., from the gross development area up to 25 percent of the gross development area to determine the net buildable area.

(2)    Divide the net buildable area by the minimum lot size of the underlying zoning district to determine the maximum adjusted gross density.

(3)    For the multifamily residential zoning district, the minimum density is 15 units per acre. The maximum density will be limited by bulk standards, maximum height, required open space, parking and other zoning standards of this title.

(4)    Limitations. Nothing contained within this chapter guarantees the maximum adjusted gross density will be attained. The adjusted gross density may not always be achievable due to unique site considerations including, but not limited to, critical areas, topography, right-of-way dedications, utility easements, open space requirements and stormwater requirements.

(5)    When the adjusted gross density is determined, if the calculation for lots or units results in a fraction of 0.5 or greater the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

(b)    Lot Size Averaging. After calculating the adjusted gross density, the proponent may apply limited lot size averaging provisions up to the amount necessary to achieve the adjusted gross density. The proponent may use one of the following methods, unless dimensional standards are modified by other sections of this title, including but not limited to planned residential developments, cluster subdivisions and infill development:

(1)    The proponent may reduce lot sizes by 10 percent within the residential development and/or subdivision provided no other dimensional reductions are applied; or

(2)    The proponent may reduce lot widths within the residential development and/or subdivision by 10 percent. In no case shall lots be less than 40 feet wide provided no lot size reductions are applied. (Ord. 1080, Sec. 8, 2020)


14.48.090 Density on Lots Where Portion Dedicated to City for Park and Recreational Facilities.

(a)    Subject to the other provisions of this section, if (1) any portion of a tract lies within an area designated on any officially adopted City plan as part of a proposed public park, greenway, or bikeway, and (2) before the tract is developed, the owner of the tract, with the concurrence of the City, dedicates to the City that portion of the tract so designated, then, when the remainder of the tract is developed for residential purposes, the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(b)    If the proposed use of the remainder is a single-family detached residential subdivision, then the lot size in such subdivision may be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Sections 14.48.070 except that the developer need not set aside usable open space to the extent that an equivalent amount of land has previously been dedicated to the City in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

(c)    If the proposed use of the remainder is a two-family or multifamily project, then the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated by regarding the dedicated portion of the original lot as if it were still part of the lot proposed for development.

(d)    If the portion of the tract that remains after dedication as provided in subsection (a) of this section is divided in such a way that the resultant parcels are intended for future subdivision or development, then each of the resultant parcels shall be entitled to its pro rata share of the “density bonus” provided for in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. (Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.48.094 Minimum Lot Size on Lots Where Right-of-Way is Dedicated to the City.

Where land is dedicated to the City for public rights-of-way for a short plat or a building permit for a single-family house or a duplex, the minimum parcel size may be reduced by an equivalent square footage as that dedicated, not to exceed 10 percent of the required minimum parcel size. (Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)

Notes:

1.    Unless otherwise stated, the dimensional standards refer to minimum requirements.

2.    The minimum required setback for garages is 20 feet from the front lot line to ensure sufficient space for cars to park in driveways without blocking sidewalks.

3.    The R8-12 zoning district applies two sets of development standards depending if the project is a detached single-family or attached townhouse development. Developments may apply a mix of standards if both types of housing are represented in the project up to the maximum adjusted gross density. 

4.    Twenty-foot minimum street frontage.

5.    Per Lake Stevens Shoreline Master Program.

6.    The allowance for impervious surfaces shall only apply to parcels with adequate stormwater facilities developed following the 2012 Washington State Department of Ecology Storm Water Management Manual for Western Washington, as amended in 2014, as now or hereafter revised; otherwise the lot coverage remains 40 percent for single-family zones (R4, R6 and WR) and 65 percent for the R8-12 zoning district on existing developed parcels.

7.    The Lake Stevens Shoreline Master Program requires a 50-foot buffer from the lake and 10-foot setback. On Waterfront Residential parcels separated from the lake by roads the rear (upland) setback is 20 feet; otherwise, rear setbacks from the water will be per the Lake Stevens Shoreline Master Program.

8.    The maximum driveway length is mandatory for standard platted lots. Exceptions to this standard may be considered on a case basis for infill lots and lots with unique site conditions including but not limited to critical areas, topography and location of easements and utility corridors.

Notes:

1.    Districts that allow commercial uses shall maintain a 10-foot, Type B screen when adjacent to residential zones, per Section 14.76.040(a).

2.    Attached housing units or attached commercial structures built on separate lots can be built to the common property line. The outside setback for attached structures abutting a right-of-way, separate detached structures, or a different zone shall be 10 feet.

3.    Landscape buffers will be comprised of a Type C screen per Section 14.76.040 next to side and rear property lines; however, the City may waive the landscape buffer when adjacent properties share parking, access, or other common features that make intensive landscaping impractical. In addition, perimeter landscape buffer next to property lines of adjacent high-density single-family lots is not required; however, screening different developments from neighboring properties will provide separation, vegetation and define each development.

4.    Structures 35 feet or taller next to single-family districts must be stepped back five feet for every floor over 35 feet.

5.    The minimum first floor height in Commercial and Mixed Use zoning districts is 15 feet; however, residential structures in Mixed Use districts, without an attached retail/service component, not facing a public right-of-way may be reduced to industry standard.

6.    The City will consider an increase in maximum height up to 80 feet with a conditional use permit per Section 14.16C.045.

7.    Development standards are found in Section 14.44.090, Planned Business District.

8.    Minimum street frontage refers to having either a direct physical connection to a street or right-of-way; or access is provided through an easement.

(1)    Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in abutting streets; and

(2)    Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized.

(b)    Specifications for driveway entrances and driveway cuts are set forth in the currently adopted version of the EDDS for the City of Lake Stevens. If driveway entrances and other openings onto streets are constructed in accordance with the EDDS specifications and requirements, this shall be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

(c)    For purposes of this section, the term “prima facie evidence” means that the permit-issuing authority may (but is not required to) conclude from this evidence alone that the proposed development complies with subsection (a) of this section. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 796, Sec. 11, 2009)


14.56.060 Coordination with Surrounding Streets.

(a)    The street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing, proposed, and anticipated streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion of a single property that is being divided into lots (hereinafter, “surrounding streets”) as provided in this section.

(b)    Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and convenient locations.

(c)    Local access residential streets shall connect with surrounding streets, including existing temporary dead-ends, to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons, but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic.

(d)    Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single property) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles. The responsibility of restoring a temporary turnaround to its permanent condition shall be borne by the party connecting to the temporary turnaround. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, no temporary dead-end street in excess of 750 feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is available.

(e)    Whenever convenient access from a subdivision to adjacent schools, parks or other public facilities is not provided through the dedication and improvement of streets pursuant to this chapter, the developer, through coordination with the applicable agency, may be required to include an unobstructed easement of at least 10 feet in width and construct a pathway to provide such access. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 796, Sec. 12, 2009)


14.56.070 Relationship of Streets to Topography.

(a)    Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and stormwater runoff objectives set forth in Chapter 14.64, and street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography.

(b)    The maximum grade at any point on a street shall be in compliance with EDDS Section 2-103 (Road Standards for Arterial and Non-Arterial Roads). However, in no case may streets be constructed with grades that, in the professional opinion of the Public Works Director or designee, create a substantial danger to the public safety. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.56.080 Coordination with the Comprehensive Plan.

(a)    Streets are intended to serve several functions. These functions vary depending on the classification of the street: (1) to carry motor vehicle traffic, provide on-street parking; (2) to provide for safe and convenient pedestrian and nonmotorized travel; and (3) to aid in managing stormwater. The requirements outlined in this chapter are intended to ensure these objectives are met.

(b)    All existing and planned streets which the City deems necessary for the completion of the City’s transportation system are shown and classified in the City’s Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. However, the list of planned streets is nonexhaustive and other streets may be proposed by a permit applicant or department director.

(c)    Any permit application shall be reviewed for conformance with the Transportation Plan. If a planned street is shown to run through or adjacent to a property proposed for development, the proposal must include roadway dedication and improvements which are generally in conformance to the plan and meet the development standards identified in this chapter. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 41, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 796, Secs. 13, 14, 2009; Ord. 676, Sec. 49, 2003; Ord. 662, Sec. 4, 2002; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.56.090 General Layout of Streets.

(a)    All streets shall be straight whenever practicable to the extent necessary to preserve and continue a grid system, except that variations in alignment are allowed as a part of a traffic calming project. Traffic calming projects are expected to be constructed in the context of the grid system, not in conflict with it.

(b)    The width of blocks should be that which is sufficient to allow for two tiers of lots (plus width of an alley or public utility easement, if any), unless existing conditions render such requirements undesirable or impractical.

(c)    The length of residential blocks should range between 500 and 700 feet, unless no other practicable alternative is available. In blocks with a length in excess of 700 feet, the City shall require a public access easement of no less than 10 feet wide through the middle of the block to provide an internal pedestrian walkway, unless deemed impractical by the Planning and Community Development Director. The access easement shall include a five-foot-wide paved path.

(d)    Streets shall be laid out so that the lengths, widths and shapes of blocks adequately:

(1)    Provide suitable building sites for the type of use to be accommodated;

(2)    Provide for subsequent construction to be able to comply with the zoning requirements;

(3)    Address the limitations and opportunities presented by the topography;

(4)    Address the need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of vehicles and pedestrians.

(e)    To the extent practicable, driveway access to arterials and collector streets shall be minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.

(f)    Repealed by Ord. 1060.

(g)    Where a property is subdivided into lots or tracts, the arrangement of lots and streets shall be such as to permit a later re-subdivision in conformance with the street and lot requirements specified in these regulations.

(h)    There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where such strips are required by the City.

(i)    A subdivision containing 30 or more parcels shall have two vehicular access points, located at least 100 feet apart. This requirement may be waived if all adjacent properties are built-out, encumbered by critical areas, or the existing topography renders a second access technically infeasible. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 662, Sec. 5, 2002; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.56.100 Dead-End Streets/Cul-de-Sacs.

(a)    Dead-end streets shall be avoided. Cul-de-sacs may be used only when conditions warrant their use:

(1)    Whenever a dead-end street serves four or more units; or

(2)    Extends more than 150 feet from edge of the intersecting right-of-way to the farthest extent of the road.

(b)    When allowed under subsection (a) of this section, all permanent dead-end streets (as opposed to temporary dead-end streets; see Section 14.56.060(d)) shall provide an appropriate turnaround for the road type in accordance with the standards set forth in the City’s currently adopted EDDS. The City will consider the use of alternative turnarounds described in the EDDS on a case-by-case basis through the EDDS deviation process outlined in Section 14.56.135.

(c)    Except where no other practicable alternative is available, such streets may not extend more than 500 feet (measured to the center of the turnaround).

(d)    Repealed by Ord. 1060.

(e)    Repealed by Ord. 1060.

(f)    Private driveways serving no more than two dwelling units shall provide a means for residential vehicles to turn around, outside of the right-of-way, if the driveway extends more than 150 feet from the edge of right-of-way. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 42, 2013)


14.56.110 Temporary Half-Streets.

(a)    Temporary half-streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-of-way and pavement width) may be allowed at the discretion of the decision-making authority under the following conditions:

(1)    Where such street, when combined with a similar street developed previously, simultaneously, or anticipated to be built within a reasonable time frame on property adjacent to the subdivision with development capacity, creates or comprises a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this title.

(2)    Where no more than 10 dwelling units will use the half-street as their sole means of access.

(3)    Where a temporary half-street is allowed, the first half of the half-street to be built shall include two travel lanes, curb, gutter, sidewalk, planter strip and street trees, depending on the street classification.

(4)    Where public right-of-way is being dedicated to the City over those portions of the property to be used as a half-street.

(b)    Where a private access tract is used, and an adjacent property is capable of being short platted with a private access tract, such tracts shall be located, constructed and dedicated in such a way so as to allow them to be combined into one 40- or 50-foot right-of-way, depending on the applicable road standard. This requirement may be waived by the Planning and Community Development Director if the build-out of the full right-of-way will be significantly constrained by critical areas, existing topography, or a lack of development potential on the adjacent property. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019)


14.56.120 Street Intersections.

(a)    Streets shall intersect at angles in compliance with EDDS Section 2-111. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless the Public Works Director or designee certifies to the permit-issuing authority that such an intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.

(b)    Spacing requirements, when connecting with arterial, nonarterial, or other driveway spacing, shall be in compliance with the currently adopted EDDS. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. For spacing requirements between centerlines of the intersecting streets, refer to EDDS Section 2-111. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019)


14.56.130 Construction Standards and Specifications.

All public streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters and other improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the currently adopted EDDS for the City of Lake Stevens. When feasible, applicants shall utilize Low Impact Development EDDS standards when constructing new public streets. All such facilities shall be completed in accordance with these standards except for deviations as provided for in Section 14.56.135 and modifications allowed for traffic calming purposes in compliance with the requirements contained in Section 14.56.260. In cases where there is a conflict between the EDDS and municipal code, the municipal code shall be the controlling document. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 43, 2013; Ord. 796, Sec. 15, 2009; Ord. 731, Sec. 3, 2006)


14.56.135 Deviations to Construction Standards and Specifications.

Deviations to the EDDS may be granted by the Public Works Director when situations arise where alternatives to the standards may better accommodate existing conditions, overcome adverse topography or allow for more cost-effective solutions without adversely affecting safety, operations, maintenance or aesthetics pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

(a)    Unless otherwise specified in this title, deviations may only be granted for standards and specifications that relate to and implement the City’s currently adopted EDDS.

(b)    Deviations shall be processed in accordance with the currently adopted EDDS.

(c)    Requests for deviation shall, at a minimum, comply with the following criteria:

(1)    The deviation will achieve the intended result of the standards with a comparable or superior design and quality of improvement;

(2)    The deviation will not adversely affect safety or operations;

(3)    The deviation will not adversely affect maintenance and related costs;

(4)    The deviation will not adversely affect the environment; and

(5)    The deviation will not adversely affect aesthetic appearance.

(d)    An annual report of deviation requests shall be submitted to the City Council. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 44, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 796, Sec. 16, 2009; Ord. 731, Sec. 3, 2006)


14.56.140 Construction Drawings Required Prior to Construction.

No right-of-way improvements shall be installed without first obtaining construction plan approval from the Public Works Director or designee. Said right-of-way improvement plans shall be certified by a licensed engineer for approval by the Public Works Director prior to starting construction. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 796, Sec. 17, 2009)


14.56.150 Inspection of Public Improvements Required Prior to Issuance of Final Permits.

All public improvement work shall be inspected by the Public Works Director or his representative prior to issuance of any final land use or building permit. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019)


14.56.160 Residential Public Streets and Private Roads.

(a)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, all lots created after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access requirement set forth in Section 14.56.030 (Access to Lots). For purposes of this section, the term “public street” includes a preexisting public street as well as streets created through a subdivision that meets the public street standards of this title and is dedicated for public use. The recordation of a plat shall constitute an offer of dedication of such street. For the purposes of subsections (b) through (d) of this section, an ADU constructed per this title shall not count as a dwelling unit.

(b)    Private roads shall not be allowed in major subdivided developments. However, private access tracts may be allowed in all subdivisions.

(c)    Private access tracts shall provide access for four or fewer dwelling units and shall include a delineated pedestrian facility. Where an existing private access tract is nonconforming with respect to minimum tract width or minimum pavement width, no additional dwelling units may take access off the tract without bringing it into conformance with this chapter.

(d)    Access easements shall provide access to no more than two dwelling units. Where an existing access easement is nonconforming with respect to minimum easement width or minimum pavement width, no additional dwelling units may take access off the easement without the developer bringing it into conformance with this chapter. Access easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width and shall have a minimum paved surface of 18 feet for the two dwelling units accessed by that paved section of easement. The width of pavement may be reduced to a minimum of 10 feet if the length of the driveway is less than 50 feet. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 796, Sec. 18, 2009; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.56.165 On-Street Parking Required.

This section is intended to require guest parking spaces in new residential subdivisions in addition to the requirements of Chapter 14.72. On-street parking shall be provided on new public streets when such streets are created and dedicated through the subdivision process, subject to the following criteria:

(a)    The minimum amount of on-street parking spaces that is required to be provided on public streets is one space per five residential parcels in each new subdivision. Dimensions of the parking spaces are subject to Section 14.72.030. When the number of parking spaces required results in a fractional space, rounding shall be calculated pursuant to Section 14.72.010(c).

(b)    The above requirement shall only apply when the subdivision includes a new public street that is constructed to an EDDS standard that includes an on-street parking lane. The parking requirement applies to the whole subdivision, including those parcels accessed by shared driveways or private tracts, and not just those parcels that abut the public street.

(c)    If the ratio of on-street spaces to residential parcels cannot be achieved on the new public street, then off-street public parking spaces are required at the same ratio.

(d)    Where parking is provided off-street as described above, the parking strip can be eliminated, so long as the roadway meets applicable fire standards and an EDDS deviation is approved per Section 14.56.135. The off-street parking must be clearly identified with signage and striping and distributed throughout the entire subdivision. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019)


14.56.170 Right-of-Way Dedication and Frontage Improvements.

Right-of-way dedication to the public and frontage improvements are required for all new development unless the applicant or property owner shows the project qualifies for the exceptions described in this section. No building permit shall be issued for development until right-of-way dedication and frontage improvement requirements have been satisfied.

(a)    Right-of-Way Width. The width of right-of-way dedication shall be determined in accordance with the roadway classifications defined in this chapter, the Comprehensive Plan and the classification standards with the adopted EDDS. Existing right-of-way widths matching or exceeding the current standards shall satisfy the width requirement. A reduction of right-of-way dedication width may be considered by the Public Works Director or his/her designee under the following conditions:

(1)    Where critical areas or their buffers as defined in Chapter 14.88 exist within the proposed dedication area; or

(2)    The dedication would deny reasonable economic use of the property under the standards of this title. The applicant or property owner must demonstrate all of the following to receive a reduction in right-of-way width dedication requirements:

(i)    The allowed land uses cannot reasonably be accomplished; and

(ii)    A reduction in the size, scope, configuration, density or consideration of alternative designs as proposed will not accomplish the project as allowed under existing land use regulations; and

(iii)    In cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the project as proposed due to other constraints such as zoning or parcel size, the applicant must show there has been a reasonable attempt to remove or accommodate such constraints.

The application or property owner pursuing a reduction in right-of-way dedication width must use the deviation process specified in Section 14.56.135. Supporting documentation and applicable application fees shall be submitted with the deviation request.

(b)    Frontage Improvements Required. Frontage improvements are required to be installed along the abutting public street frontage of the property to be developed. Resurfacing an existing public street to its centerline shall not be required for single-family or duplex development.

(1)    “Frontage improvements” used in this section refer to the construction, reconstruction or repair of the following facilities along public rights-of-way abutting a property being developed per the applicable street classification:

(i)    Curbs, gutters, bike lanes and sidewalks;

(ii)    Planter strips (or tree wells);

(iii)    Underground storm drainage and other utility facilities;

(iv)    Resurfacing of the existing public street to the centerline; and

(v)    Construction of new street within dedicated unopened right-of-way.

(iii)    Binding site plans;

(iv)    All other residential projects unless expressly exempt pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of this section or a waiver is granted in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section;

(v)    Commercial projects;

(vi)    Municipal or agency building projects; and

(vii)    Industrial projects.

(3)    Frontage requirements related to the construction of a single-family or duplex dwelling unit shall be considered completed provided the following exceptions apply:

(i)    An existing lot in an existing single-family subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan where the lots are fully developed and frontage improvements were constructed to the standards in effect at the time of final plat recording; or

(ii)    A new single-family residence on an existing lot or replacement of an existing single-family residence where there are no frontage improvements meeting City standards constructed within 200 feet of the lot or improvements identified through an approved subdivision and potential exists for future development.

(4)    The granting of an exception or waiver as outlined in subsection (b)(3) or (5) of this section does not waive the property owner’s requirement to dedicate right-of-way as established in this section.

(5)    The Public Works Director may accept a fee in lieu of constructing frontage improvements for new development when the applicant or property owner demonstrates that at least one of the following conditions exist:

(i)    There are no existing sidewalks along the same side of the street within two adjacent lots or 100 feet, whichever is less, of the property on either side or on one side for corner lots on each frontage;

(ii)    Construction of frontage improvements will adversely impact critical areas that cannot be adequately mitigated in accordance with Chapter 14.88 or the State Environmental Policy Act pursuant to Title 16;

(iii)    A safety issue is created by constructing the frontage improvements;

(iv)    A public roadway improvement project is scheduled and fully funded for construction and said project includes the adjacent site frontage.

The applicant or property owner shall apply for a waiver using the deviation process specified in Section 14.56.135. The application shall address how the criteria set forth in Section 14.56.135(c) are met and how the applicable conditions in this subsection above apply to the project. Any supporting documentation and applicable application fees shall be submitted with the deviation request.

(c)    Dedication of Right-of-Way. Dedication of right-of-way is required to be executed prior to building permit issuance or final project approval. For subdivisions, short subdivisions and binding site plans, the dedication shall be required on the final recording documents. For projects that are not part of a subdivision of land, the applicant shall submit the required executed documents on forms provided by the City. The City shall record the documents upon obtaining the appropriate City signatures and the applicant or property owner pays the recording fees.

(d)    Acceptance of Frontage Improvements. The Public Works Director or designee may approve an extension for the completion of the improvements for up to one year if the Public Works Director or designee receives a surety bond or equivalent cash deposit ensuring the timely completion of the improvements. Said surety bond shall meet the requirements set forth in Section 14.16A.180 (Security Mechanisms).

(e)    State or Federal Law. Where an applicant demonstrates under applicable State or Federal law that the required dedication or improvements are unlawful, the Public Works Director or designee, to the extent the obligation is unlawful, shall not require the dedication or improvements required by this section as a condition of final acceptance or of building permit issuance.

(f)    Appeal of Director Decision. Any appeal of the Director or designee’s determination shall be processed using the appeal processes specified for the underlying application pursuant to Section 14.16A.265. A timely appeal shall be required in order to constitute an exhaustion of remedies under this section. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 916, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2014)


14.56.180 Road and Sidewalk Requirements in Unsubdivided Developments.

(a)    Within unsubdivided developments, which includes multifamily, commercial and industrial developments, all private roads and access ways shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and gutter, and paving specifications shall be determined by the provisions of this title dealing with parking (Chapter 14.72) and drainage (Chapter 11.06). To the extent not otherwise covered in the foregoing chapters, and to the extent that the requirements set forth in this chapter for subdivision streets may be relevant to the roads in unsubdivided developments, the requirements of this chapter may be applied to satisfy the standard set forth in the first sentence of this subsection.

(b)    Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two or more collector or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to subdivision streets and shall be dedicated to the public. In other cases when roads in unsubdivided developments within the City are constructed in accordance with the specifications for subdivision streets, the City may accept an offer of dedication of such streets.

(c)    In all unsubdivided residential development, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units with other dwelling units, the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking areas, laundry facilities, and recreational areas and facilities.

(d)    Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer, through coordination with the applicable agency, may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least 10 feet to provide such access.

(e)    The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five feet wide and constructed according to the specifications set forth in the currently adopted EDDS. Alternative pedestrian facilities may be considered on a case by case basis through an EDDS deviation. (Ord. 1060, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 796, Sec. 20, 2009)

Part I.    General


14.60.010 Utility Ownership and Easement Rights.

In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of water, sewer, electrical power, natural gas, telephone, cable television, or other types of utility facilities and intends that such facilities shall be owned, operated, or maintained by a public utility or any entity other than the developer, the developer shall transfer to such utility or entity the necessary ownership or easement rights to enable the utility or entity to operate and maintain such facilities. (Ord. 468, 1995)


14.60.020 Lots Served by Government Owned Water or Sewer Lines.

(a)    Whenever it is legally possible and practicable in terms of topography to connect a lot with a city sewer line by running a connecting line not more than 200 feet from the lot to such line, then no use requiring sewage disposal service may be made of such lot unless connection is made to such line. 

(b)    Connection to such sewer line is not legally possible if, in order to make connection with such line by a connecting line that does not exceed 300 feet in length, it is necessary to run the connecting line over property not owned by the owner of the property to be served by the connection, and, after diligent effort, the easement necessary to run the connecting line cannot reasonably be obtained.

(c)    For purposes of this chapter, a lot is “served” by a city-owned sewer line if connection is required by this section. (Ord. 679, Sec. 12, 2003; Ord. 676, Sec. 50, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.60.030 Right-of-Way Permit Required.

14.60.040 Utility Systems in Right-of -Way.

All utility systems in City road rights-of-way shall be designed pursuant to the currently adopted version of the Engineering Design and Development Standards for the City of Lake Stevens and this chapter. (Ord. 796, Sec. 22, 2009)

Part II.    Sewer

A.    Sewage Disposal System


14.60.100 Sewage Disposal Facilities Required.

(a)    Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a sewage disposal system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision lot and that complies with all applicable health regulations. Connection to an approved sewage disposal system is required prior to the issuance of a final inspection or certificate of occupancy, or before any use reliant upon the sewer system may commence.

(b)    Whenever connection to the City’s sewer system is required pursuant to a land use permit or as required by the local health department, a sewer main shall be extended from the existing sewer system through the property to the far side(s) of the subject property(s) and along the property’s street frontages, as necessary to provide sewer service to the subject parcel and adjacent parcels feasibly served by the required extension(s). The connection to the existing sewer shall be made where dictated by the Public Works Director. Sewer mains extended pursuant to this section shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter, and shall be larger if so indicated in the City’s comprehensive sewer plan or sewer capital facilities plan. If the City has previously installed all or a portion of the required sewer line, the developer shall pay the City an in-lieu assessment fee as provided for in Title 6. The cost of oversizing a sewer main extension to larger than ten inches in diameter shall be credited toward the sewer general facilities charges normally due for connection of the subject property to the sewer system. (Ord. 676, Sec. 51, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.60.110 Determining Compliance with Section 14.60.100.

(a)    Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the standard set forth in Section 14.60.100 may lie with a sewer purveyor other than the City, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such purveyor. The relevant agencies are listed in subsection (b) of this section. Whenever any such purveyor requires detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed sewage disposal system, the authority issuing a permit under this chapter may rely upon a preliminary review by such purveyor of the basic design elements of the proposed sewage disposal system to determine compliance with Section 14.60.100. However, construction of such system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such purveyor.

(b)    In the following if-then list, the if statement describes the type of development and the then statement indicates the purveyor that must certify to the city whether the proposed sewage disposal system complies with the standard set forth in Section 14.60.100.

(1)    If: The use is located on a lot that is served by the city sewer system or a previously approved, privately owned package treatment plant, and the use can be served by a simple connection to the system (as in the case of a single family residence) rather than the construction of an internal collection system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex):

Then: No further certification is necessary.

(2)    If: The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot that is served by the city sewer system but service to the use necessitates construction of an internal collection system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex); and

a.    The internal collection system is to be transferred to and maintained by the city:

Then: The public works director must certify to the city that the proposed internal collection system meets the city’s specifications and will be accepted by the city. (A “Permit to Construct” must be obtained from the Washington State Department of Ecology.)

b.    The internal collection system is to be privately maintained:

Then: The public works director must certify that the proposed collection system is adequate.

(3)    If: The use (other than a subdivision) is not served by the city system but is to be served by a privately operated sewage treatment system (that has not previously been approved) with 3,000 gallons or less design capacity, the effluent from which does not discharge to surface waters:

Then: The Snohomish County Health District (SCHD) must certify to the city that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and local health regulations. If the proposed use is a single dwelling other than a mobile home, the developer must obtain an improvement permit from the SCHD. If the proposed use is a single-family mobile home, the developer must present to the City a certificate of completion from the SCHD.

(4)    If: The use (other than a subdivision) is to be served by a privately operated sewage treatment system (not previously approved) that has a design capacity of more than 3,000 gallons or that discharges effluent into surface waters:

Then: The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) must certify to the city that the proposed system complies with all applicable state regulations. (A “Permit to Construct” and a “Permit to Discharge" must be obtained from DOE.)

(5)    If: The proposed use is a subdivision; and

a.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by simple connection to existing city lines or lines of a previously approved private system:

Then: No further certification is necessary.

b.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by the city system but the developer will be responsible for installing the necessary additions to the city system:

Then: The public works director must certify to the city that the proposed system meets the city’s specifications and will be accepted by the city; and the plans must be reviewed and approved by DOE.

c.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a sewage treatment system that has not been approved, that has a design capacity of 3,000 gallons or less, and that does not discharge into surface waters:

Then: The Snohomish County Health District must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and local health regulations. If each lot within the subdivision is to be served by a separate on-site disposal system, the SCHD must certify that each lot shown on a major subdivision preliminary plat can probably be served, and each lot on a major or short subdivision final plat can be served by an on-site disposal system.

d.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a privately operated sewage treatment system (not previously approved) that has a design capacity in excess of 3,000 gallons or that discharges effluent into surface waters:

Then: The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state regulations. (A “Permit to Construct” and a “Permit to Discharge” must be obtained from DOE.) (Ord. 676, Sec. 52, 2003: 468, 1995)


14.60.120 Private Sewage Disposal.

(a)    Where a public sanitary sewer is not available for use as provided by Section 14.60.020 (Lots Served by Government Owned Water or Sewer Lines), and the City so certifies and approves, and if approved by the Snohomish Health District, the building sewer may be connected to a private sewage disposal system or replacement, any of which must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

(b)    Pursuant to RCW 70.64 and WAC 248.96, the City recognizes the Snohomish County Health District as the legitimate agency to supervise and direct the on-site sewer system permit process. All permitting and inspection of private sewage disposal systems shall be done by the Snohomish Health District, PROVIDED that any application to the Health District for installation of a new on-site sewage system must be accompanied by a letter from the City stating that no sanitary systems are available and that the proposed on-site sewage system conforms to applicable City Code requirements. All related Health District fees shall be paid by the property owner. A copy of the Snohomish Health District permit shall be furnished to the City by the property owner prior to any construction work.

(c)    An appropriate fee may be established by Resolution for the above service provided by the City. (Ord. 468, 1995)


14.60.130 Conveyance of Facilities to City.

(a)    Any private or public sewer facility not owned by the City may be conveyed to the City if it meets the criteria listed in subsection (b). If the City accepts that conveyance, the sewer thereafter shall be a public sewer under the jurisdiction of the City.

(b)    The following criteria shall be met, unless otherwise waived by the Public Works Director, prior to conveyance of sewer facilities to the City:

(1)    A public utility easement of adequate dimensions shall be concurrently granted to the City.

(2)    The facilities shall be inspected for conformance with the adopted standards specified for public sewer facilities specified in this Chapter, Title 6 LSMC or in administrative guidelines prepared by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may require any test to demonstrate such conformance. Such tests may include, but are not limited to, infiltration, exfiltration, air tests, or a combination thereof. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Public Works Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection.

(3)    The applicant shall pay any and all required fees per Title 6 and 14.

(4)    The Public Works Director shall require that a maintenance bond be provided to ensure workmanship for a period of two years. (Ord. 676, Sec. 53, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)

Subsequent lifts of not more than 6-inch thickness shall be installed to 6 inches over the crown of the pipe and individually compacted to 90% of maximum density as determined by AASHO T-99. Bedding material shall be a clean sand-gravel mixture free from organic matter and conforming to the following graduation when tested in accordance with ASTM D-422.

(4)    CRIBBING AND SHEETING

That portion of cribbing or sheeting extending below the crown elevation of flexible pipe shall be left in place unless satisfactory means of reconsolidating bedding or side support, disturbed by cribbing or sheeting removal, can be demonstrated. If a movable box is used in lieu of cribbing or sheeting, and the bottom of the box cannot be kept above the spring line of rigid pipe or the crown elevation of flexible pipe, the bedding or side support shall be carefully reconsolidated behind the movable box prior to placing backfill.

(5)    PIPE DEFLECTION

When required by the Public Works Director, the amount of pipe deflection shall be tested after the trench backfill and compaction has been completed. The test shall consist of pulling a wooden mandrel through the completed pipeline with a diameter equal to 95% of the pipe diameter. The contractor will be required to replace any pipelines that fail the test.

(b)    Building Sewer – Size, Slope and Length. The size, slope and length of the building sewer shall be subject to the inspection, verification and approval of the Public Works Director, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches from one connection to a single family residence and six inches for connections to/from two to not more than four single family residences. The size of building sewers for other connections shall be determined by the Public Works Director. The slope of such building sewer shall be not less than 2% for 4-inch and 6-inch pipe unless the depth of the public sewer requires a lesser slope and such lesser slope is approved by the Public Works Director, who may require the owner to *caused by such lesser slope. The maximum permitted length of 4-inch pipe used as a building sewer shall be 100 feet. The maximum permitted length of 6-inch pipe, or a combination of 4-inch and 6-inch pipe, used as a building sewer shall be 200 feet.

(c)    Building Sewer – Elevation – Direction. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid under any building or within two and one-half feet of any foundation wall, unless the building sewer is constructed of ductile-iron pipe. The minimum depth of trench shall be 18 inches. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings, as approved by the Public Works Director. Fittings shall be used at all major changes of direction and a clean out shall be provided at such fittings. Wherever any building drain is constructed too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial mean and discharged into the public sewer at the owner’s expense.

(d)    Information from the Public Works Department. The owner of any building shall be responsible for obtaining from the Public Works Director the location and elevation of the sewer tee or sewer stub at the point of connection and, in the case of new construction, for planning the building and plumbing and to provide adequate slope for the building sewer. The applicant for permit shall be responsible for determining the available grade between building drain and sewer tee stub.

(e)    Building Sewer – Excavation – Pipe Laying. All excavations required for the installations of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with the following specifications:

(1)    Pipe shall be carefully bedded, either by forming the trench bottom to support the bottom one quarter of the pipe or by over-excavating and bedding with granular material, thoroughly tamped or trod under and alongside the pipe.

(2)    No large rocks shall be left in the trench bottom which may damage the pipe and no large rocks shall be placed in the backfill.

(3)    Pipes shall be laid with spigot ends downstream and all changes of direction shall be made by suitable fittings as provided in (c) above. Trench shall be free of water during laying of pipe and during inspection.

(4)    No backfill shall be placed over the pipe until the work has been inspected and approved.

(5)    Backfill shall be placed by hand and be thoroughly tamped or trod to six inches above the top of the pipe.

(6)    Only the owner or a registered side sewer contractor may excavate in the vicinity of a public sewer and stubs.

(7)    No downspouts or outside drains shall be connected to a building sewer.

(8)    With respect to building sewer connections to public sewers in or adjacent to Lake Stevens, the excavation for the connection into the public sewer or stub serving the public sewer and the connection thereto shall be made only under the visual inspection of the Public Works Director or his representative.

(f)    Building Sewers – Joints and Connections. All joints and connections shall be made gas tight and watertight in accordance with City specifications. All joints between dissimilar pipes shall be made with suitable adapter couplings, special fabricated coupling, or cement mortar approved by the Public Works Director. Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval of the Public Works Director.

(g)    Building Sewer - Connection to Public Sewer. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at a stub, if such stub is available at the suitable location, or to a right-angle sewer tee. If no properly located stub or tee is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer and a pre-manufactured tee installed with entry at right angles, which hole may be cut only by a registered side sewer contractor. The invert of the sewer tee at the point of connection shall be at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the Public Works Director.

(h)    Building Sewer – Inspection. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Public Works Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection. The grade, materials, and manner of construction shall be subject to approval of the Public Works Director or a regularly-appointed sewer inspector. The Public Works Director may require any test to demonstrate that the building sewer meets the standards specified herein. Such tests may be infiltration tests, exfiltration, air, tests or a combination of them. (Ord. 679, Sec. 13, 2003)

Part III.    Water


14.60.300 Water Supply System Required.

Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a water supply system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision lot and that complies with all applicable health regulations.


14.60.310 Determining Compliance with Section 14.60.300.

(a)    Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the standard set forth in Section 14.60.300 often lies with an agency other than the city, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency. The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (b). Whenever any such agency requires detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed water supply system, the authority issuing a permit under this chapter may rely upon a preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed water supply system to determine compliance with Section 14.60.300. However, construction of such system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such agency.

(b)    In the following if-then list, the if statement describes the type of development and the then statement indicates the agency that must certify to the city whether the proposed water system complies with the standard set forth in Section 14.60.300.

(1)    If: The use is located on a lot that is served by the Snohomish County Public Utility District No. 1 (PUD) water system or a previously approved, privately owned public water supply system and the use can be served by a simple connection to the system (as in the case of a single family residence) rather than the construction of an internal distribution system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex):

Then: No further certification is necessary.

(2)    If: The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot that is served by the PUD water system but service to the use necessitates construction of an internal distribution system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex); and

a.    The internal distribution system is to be transferred to and maintained by the PUD.

Then: The PUD must certify to the city that the proposed internal distribution system meets PUD specifications and will be accepted by the PUD.

b.    The internal distribution system is to be privately maintained:

Then: The public works director must certify that the proposed collection system is adequate.

(3)    If: The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot not served by the PUD system or a previously approved, privately owned public water supply system; and

a.    The use is to be served by a privately owned public water supply system that has not previously been approved:

Then: The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and federal regulations. (A “Permit to Construct” must be obtained from (DOE.) The DOE must also approve the plans if the water source is a well and the system has a design capacity of 100,000 gallons per day or is located in certain areas designated by DOE. The PUD must also approve the distribution lines for possible future addition to the city system.

b.    The use is to be served by some other source (such as an individual well):

Then: The Snohomish County Health District must certify that the proposed system meets all applicable state and local regulations.

(4)    If: The proposed use is a subdivision; and

a.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by simple connection to existing city lines or lines of a previously approved public water supply system:

Then: No further certification is necessary.

b.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by the PUD system but the developer will be responsible for installing the necessary additions to such system:

Then: The PUD must certify to the city that the proposed system meets PUD specifications and will be accepted by the PUD.

c.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a privately owned public water supply system that has not previously been approved:

Then: The Snohomish County Health District (SCHD) must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and federal regulations. (A “Permit to Construct” must be obtained from DHS.) The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) must also approve the plans if the water source is a well and the system has a design capacity of 100,000 gallons per day or is located within certain areas designated by DOE. The PUD must also approve the distribution lines for possible future addition to the PUD system.

d.    Lots within the subdivision are to be served by individual wells:

Then: The Snohomish County Health District must certify to the city that each lot intended to be served by a well can be served in accordance with applicable health regulations.

14.62.010 Purpose.

This chapter defines the regulations for placing, developing, permitting and removing all types of wireless communication facilities (“WCF”) including macro and small wireless facilities. It also provides adequate siting opportunities by identifying a range of locations and options that support wireless communications technology. This chapter encourages siting facilities on existing buildings or structures, collocating providers on single structures, maintaining neighborhood appearances and reducing visual clutter in the City. Specific purposes include:

(a)    Minimizing potential adverse visual, aesthetic, and safety impacts of wireless facilities;

(b)    Establishing objective standards for the placement of wireless facilities;

(c)    Allowing competition that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services;

(d)    Encouraging the design of wireless facilities to be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding built and natural environments; and

(e)    Encouraging the collocation or attachment of small wireless facilities on existing support structures to help minimize the total number and impact of such structures throughout the community. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.020 Definitions.

Part IV. Small Wireless Facilities


14.62.220 Purpose and Intent.

To manage its right-of-way in a thoughtful manner, the City of Lake Stevens has adopted this process for the deployment of small wireless facilities. Sections 14.62.130 through 14.62.210 shall not apply to the deployment of small wireless facilities. The process balances the need to accommodate new and evolving technologies with the preservation of the natural and aesthetic environment of the City while complying with the requirements of State and Federal law.

Service providers who seek to utilize the public right-of-way for small wireless facility deployment to provide wireless communication, data transmission or other related services must have a valid franchise to provide the specific service seeking to utilize the right-of-way and a right-of-way permit to deploy the technology. Entities with franchises who wish to utilize a small wireless facility deployment to upgrade or expand their existing services shall utilize the processes set forth in this chapter to deploy their technology and obtain design approval of specific installations.

A right-of-way permit in addition to a land use permit is required for small wireless facility deployment under the franchise, to the extent required under Section 14.62.080(b). An entity without a franchise shall apply for a consolidated permit which shall be processed concurrently as one master permit within the meaning of RCW 35.99.010(3) and 35.99.030. For entities with a valid franchise, see Section 14.62.240.

(a)    Nothing in this part revises or diminishes the rights and obligations of an existing franchise.

(b)    The term “small wireless facility deployment” shall include the deployment of small wireless facilities and small wireless facility networks as those terms are defined by this chapter.

(c)    Existing franchisees with franchises that do not specifically permit small wireless facility deployment shall be required to either amend their existing franchise or enter a new franchise with the City. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.230 Review Process.

The following provisions relate to applications for a franchise or right-of-way permit for small wireless facility deployments:

(a)    Review of Facilities. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant shall be governed by the provisions of 47 USC Sections 253 and 332, Federal regulations and applicable case law. Applicants for franchises and the right-of-way permits which implement the franchise shall be treated in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner with other service providers utilizing supporting infrastructure which is functionally equivalent; that is, service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement or cumulative impacts. Franchise and right-of-way permit review under this chapter shall neither prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services.

(b)    Third-Party Requirements.

(1)    All installations of small wireless facilities must have permission from the pole/structure owner to install facilities on such structure.

(2)    Governing Construction or Electrical Code. All installations of small wireless facilities shall comply with any governing construction or electrical code such as the National Electrical Safety Code, the National Electric Code or State electrical code, as applicable. All installations of ground-mounted or replacement structures shall comply with the City’s adopted standards for construction in the right-of-way.

(3)    Electrical Connection. The City is not responsible for providing electricity to small wireless facilities. Any third-party utility providing such electricity must obtain a franchise from the City prior to operating in the rights-of-way.

(4)    Transport/Telecommunications Connection. The City is not responsible for providing transport connectivity (e.g., fiber) to small wireless facilities. Any third-party utility providing such transport connectivity must obtain a franchise from the City prior to operating in the rights-of-way. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.240 Design and Concealment Standards for Small Wireless Facility Deployments.

Small wireless facility deployments permitted in accordance with this chapter shall conform to the following design standards in addition to the City’s adopted design guidelines as they relate to screening of utilities:

(a)    Small wireless facilities attached to existing or replacement light poles and other poles in the right-of-way or poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design criteria:

(1)    Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures (including disconnect switches and other appurtenant devices) shall be fully concealed within the pole, unless such concealment is otherwise technically infeasible, or is incompatible with the pole design, then the antennas and associated equipment enclosures must be camouflaged to appear as an integral part of the pole or to the extent technically feasible flush-mounted to the pole, meaning no more than six inches off of the pole for nonwooden poles and no more than 12 inches off the pole for wooden poles, and must be the minimum size necessary for the intended purpose, not to exceed the volumetric dimensions of small wireless facilities. If the equipment enclosure is permitted on the exterior of the pole, the applicant is required to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(2)    The furthest point of any equipment enclosure may not extend more than 28 inches from the face of the pole, unless proven technically infeasible.

(3)    All conduit, cables, wires and fiber must be routed internally in the light pole if nonwooden pole. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires and fiber is required within mounting brackets, shrouds, canisters or sleeves if attaching to exterior antennas or equipment.

(4)    An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than six feet above the height of the existing pole and the diameter may not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, unless the applicant can demonstrate that more space is needed. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design so that it appears as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or painted to match or be compatible with the pole, and shall be shrouded or screened to blend with the pole except for canister antennas which shall not require screening. All cabling and mounting hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall be fully concealed and/or integrated with the pole for nonwooden poles and shall be concealed either within the canister antenna or within a sleeve between the antenna and pole on a wooden pole.

(5)    Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is replacing or the neighboring pole design standards utilized within the contiguous right-of-way.

(6)    The height of any replacement pole may not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the existing pole or the minimum additional height necessary for adequate clearance from electrical wires, whichever is greater.

(7)    The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the City’s sidewalk clearance requirements and shall, to the extent technically feasible, not be more than a 25 percent increase of the existing pole measured at the base of the pole, unless additional diameter is needed in order to conceal equipment within the pole.

(8)    The use of any pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(9)    Antennas, equipment enclosures, and all ancillary equipment, boxes and conduit shall be colored or painted to match the approximate color of the surface of the pole on which they are attached.

(10)    Antennas should be placed to minimize visual clutter and obtrusiveness. Multiple antennas are permitted on a pole; provided, that each antenna enclosure shall not be more than three cubic feet in volume, not to exceed a maximum of 12 cubic feet.

(11)    An omni-directional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing pole, provided such antenna is no more than four feet in height and is mounted directly on the top of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket.

(12)    Replacement wooden poles must either match the approximate color and materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used by the pole owner in the City.

(13)    Equipment for small wireless facilities must be attached to the wooden pole, unless otherwise permitted to be ground-mounted pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of this section. The applicant is encouraged to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(14)    An applicant who desires to enclose both its antennas and equipment within one unified enclosure may do so; provided, that such enclosure is the minimum size necessary for its intended purpose and the enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the pole, including wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the pole, do not exceed 28 cubic feet. The unified enclosure may not be placed more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner. To the extent possible, the unified enclosure shall be placed to appear as an integrated part of the pole or behind banners or signs; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(15)    All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of a wooden pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match or be compatible with the wooden pole. The number of conduits shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to accommodate the small wireless facilities.

(b)    Small wireless facilities attached to existing buildings shall conform to the following design criteria:

(1)    Small wireless facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building’s architectural theme.

(2)    The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is discouraged.

(3)    New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the architecture of the existing building.

(4)    Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary to provide the smallest offset from the building.

(5)    Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited.

(6)    Small wireless facilities shall be painted or colored and textured to match or be compatible with the adjacent building surfaces.

(c)    Small wireless facilities mounted on cables (strand-mounted) strung between existing utility poles shall conform to the following standards:

(1)    Each strand-mounted facility shall not exceed three cubic feet in volume;

(2)    Only two strand-mounted facilities are permitted per cable between any two existing poles;

(3)    The strand-mounted devices shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest utility pole, in no event more than five feet from the pole unless a greater distance is technically necessary or is required by the pole owner for safety clearance;

(4)    No strand-mounted device shall be in or above the portion of the roadway open to vehicular traffic;

(5)    Ground-mounted equipment to accommodate a shared mounted facility is not permitted except when placed in preexisting equipment cabinets or required by other parties, such as an electrical provider;

(d)    General Requirements.

(1)    Single-Facility Installation. Each utility pole may not contain more than one small wireless facility provider.

(2)    Ground-mounted equipment in the rights-of-way is prohibited, unless such facilities are placed under ground or the applicant can demonstrate that pole-mounted or undergrounded equipment is technically infeasible. If ground-mounted equipment is necessary, then the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan. Generators located in the rights-of-way are prohibited.

(3)    Equipment Enclosure Location and Dimensions. The applicant shall minimize the primary equipment enclosure space and use the smallest amount of enclosure possible to fit the necessary equipment. The primary equipment enclosure shall be located using the following methods in priority order, unless a lower priority method minimizes visual impact:

(i)    For nonwooden poles, concealed completely within the pole or pole base. If within the pole base, the base shall meet the ADA requirements and not impact the pedestrian access route.

(ii)    Located on a pole. If located on a pole, the equipment enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the pole shall be the minimum amount necessary and shall not exceed 28 cubic feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more closely integrate with the pole design and does not cumulatively exceed 28 cubic feet.

(iii)    Underground in a utility vault. If located underground, the access lid to the primary equipment enclosure shall be located outside the footprint of any pedestrian curb ramp and shall have a nonskid surface meeting ADA requirement if located within an existing pedestrian access route.

(iv)    On private property. If located on private property, the applicant shall submit a copy of an executed easement or lease agreement with the private property owner prior to the right-of-way permit issuance. In addition, if the private property is zoned residential, the applicant shall comply with the permit requirements for WCF in this chapter.

(4)    No equipment shall be operated to produce noise in violation of Chapter 9.56.

(5)    Replacement poles and new poles along with all support structures shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), City construction and sidewalk clearance standards, City ordinances, and State and Federal laws and regulations to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way.

(6)    Replacement poles shall be located as near as possible to the existing pole with the requirement to remove the abandoned pole.

(7)    No signage, message or identification other than the manufacturer’s identification or identification required by governing law can be portrayed on any antenna or equipment enclosure. Any permitted signage shall be located on the equipment enclosures and be of the minimum amount possible to achieve the intended purpose; provided, that signs are permitted as concealment element techniques where appropriate.

(8)    Antennas and related equipment shall not be illuminated except for security reasons, required by a Federal or State authority, or unless approved as part of a concealment element plan.

(9)    Side-arm mounts for antennas or equipment must be the minimum extension necessary and for wooden poles may be no more than 12 inches off the pole, as measured from the surface of the pole to the inside edge of the antennas or equipment, and for nonwooden poles no more than six inches off the pole, unless technically infeasible.

(10)    The preferred location of a small wireless facility on a pole is the location with the least visible impact.

(11)    Antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary equipment, conduit and cable shall not dominate the structure or pole upon which they are attached.

(12)    Except for locations in the right-of-way, small wireless facilities are not permitted on any property containing a residential use in the residential zones.

(13)    The City may consider the cumulative visual effects of small wireless facilities mounted on poles within the rights-of-way when assessing proposed siting locations so as to not adversely affect the visual character of the City. This provision shall not be applied to limit the number of permits issued when no alternative sites are reasonably available nor to impose a technological requirement on the applicant.

(14)    These design standards are intended to be used solely for concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape.

(Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.250 Design Zones for Small Wireless Facilities.

(a)    The following areas are hereby designated “design zones” for this chapter. Design zones shall include the following districts:

(1)    All zones within Lake Stevens Center Subarea.

(2)    All zones within the 20th Street SE Corridor Subarea.

(3)    All zones within the Downtown Lake Stevens Subarea.

(b)    Any applicant who desires to place a small wireless facility in a design zone must first establish that the applicant cannot locate the small wireless facility outside of the design zone. Applications for small wireless facilities in a design zone may be approved if the applicant demonstrates that due to technical infeasibility the applicant cannot locate the proposed small wireless facility on an existing or replacement pole within 500 feet of the proposed site and outside of the design zone.

(c)    Small wireless facilities within the Downtown Lake Stevens Subarea shall not be placed on new decorative light standards unless technologically infeasible to locate on structures outside of the right-of-way and provide sufficient coverage.

(d)    Applications for small wireless facilities within design zones must receive a land use approval and comply with a concealment element design described in Section 14.62.260(b), in addition to the requirements in Section 14.62.280. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.260 New Poles in the Rights-of-Way for Small Wireless Facilities and Installations in a Design Zone.

(a)    New poles within the rights-of-way are only permitted if the applicant can establish that:

(1)    The proposed small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing utility pole or light pole, electrical transmission tower or on a site outside of the public rights-of-way such as on existing structures or poles in a public park, public property, building, transmission tower or in or on a nonresidential use in a residential zone whether by roof- or panel-mount or separate structure;

(2)    Any new pole complies with the generally applicable requirements of Section 14.62.240(d);

(3)    The proposed small wireless facility receives approval for a concealment element design, as described in subsection (b) of this section;

(4)    The proposed small wireless facility also complies with the Shoreline Management Act, and SEPA, if applicable; and

(5)    No new poles shall be in a critical area or associated buffer required by the City’s critical areas management ordinance (Chapter 14.88), except when determined to be exempt pursuant to said ordinance.

(b)    The concealment element design shall include the design of the screening, fencing or other concealment technology for a tower, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless facility, including but not limited to fiber and power connections.

(1)    The concealment element design should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of the small wireless facility. The proposed pole or structure should have similar designs to existing neighboring poles in the rights-of-way, including similar height to the extent technically feasible. If the proposed small wireless facility is placed on a replacement pole in a design zone, then the replacement pole shall be of the same general design as the pole it is replacing, unless the development services department otherwise approves a variation due to aesthetic or safety concerns. Any concealment element design for a small wireless facility on a decorative pole should attempt to mimic the design of such pole and integrate the small wireless facility into the design of the decorative pole. Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color, and texture - or the appearance thereof - as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to utilize designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure. Further, applicant designs should, to the extent technically possible, comply with the generally applicable design standards adopted pursuant to this section.

(2)    If the Director has already approved a concealment element design either for the applicant or another small wireless facility along the same public right-of-way or for the same pole type, then the applicant shall utilize a substantially similar concealment element design, unless it can show that such concealment element design is not physically or technologically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards.

(c)    Even if an alternative location is established pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section the Director may determine that a new pole in the right-of-way is in fact a superior alternative based on the impact to the City, the concealment element design, the City’s Comprehensive Plan and the added benefits to the community.

(d)    Prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a new pole or ground-mounted equipment in the right-of-way, the applicant must obtain a site-specific agreement from the City to locate such new pole or ground-mounted equipment. The requirement also applies to the placement of replacement poles when the replacement is necessary for the installation or attachment of the small wireless facility, the replacement structure is higher than the replaced structure, and the overall height of the replacement structure and the wireless facility is more than 60 feet.

(e)    These design standards are intended to be used solely for concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections of the streetscape. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.270 Franchise Application.

Applicants for small wireless facilities shall apply using the City’s franchise application form and submit a fee per the City’s fee schedule to process an application for a franchise.

All franchise applications shall designate the entire City right-of-way as the franchise boundary. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.280 Implementation - Right-of-Way Permits for Small Wireless Facility Deployment.

The rights granted under the franchise are implemented through the issuance of right-of-way permits. The franchise application may be accompanied by one or more applications for a right-of-way permit to deploy a small wireless facility. An initial franchise and all related right-of-way permit applications shall be processed concurrently as one master permit under Chapter 35.99 RCW.

(a)    The applicant can batch multiple small wireless facility sites in one application. The applicant is encouraged to batch the small wireless facility sites within an application in a contiguous service area and/or with similar pole designs.

(b)    Issuance of a right-of-way permit to install a small wireless facility deployment shall be contingent upon approval of a franchise or the possession of a valid franchise.

(c)    The Director may approve, deny or conditionally approve all or any portion of the sites proposed in the right-of-way permit application; provided, that the denial of one or more small cell facilities in a consolidated application shall not delay the processing of any other small wireless facility or related poles submitted in the same consolidated application. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.290 Ground-Mounted Equipment.

In areas of the City where overhead utility lines have been undergrounded (undergrounded areas), in designated design zones (see Section 14.62.250), and in other areas where necessary to permit full use of the public right-of-way by pedestrians, bicycles and other users, all ground-mounted equipment shall be undergrounded in a vault meeting the City’s construction standards. The location of ground-mounted equipment (to the extent undergrounding such equipment is not technologically feasible), a replacement pole or street light shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), City development standards, and State and Federal regulations to provide a clear and safe passage within the public right-of-way. Ground-mounted equipment is also permitted on private property adjacent to the public right-of-way with a recorded easement or lease agreement and permit in accordance with requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.300 Underground Districts.

(a)    Underground Districts. The City requires the undergrounding of new utilities, which would include all support equipment including, but not limited to, any backhaul or electricity, but not antennas and their support structures for small wireless facilities in all areas of the City except within the rights-of-way along the following roads:

(1)    State Route 9;

(2)    State Route 92;

(3)    State Route 204;

(4)    Lundeen Parkway from SR 9 to Callow Road;

(5)    20th Street NE except between 118th Avenue NE and 127th Avenue NE;

(6)    20th Street SE.

(b)    In areas designated as underground districts and where other utilities are located underground, a service provider or infrastructure company desiring to locate any aboveground infrastructure in support of a small wireless facility deployment shall demonstrate that it is technologically infeasible to incorporate support facilities within proposed or existing light poles or in a vault underground. In such cases the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.62.240.

(c)    In areas designated as underground districts where existing utilities are currently located above ground, small wireless facilities may be located above ground with the submission of a concealment element plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.62.240. Such facilities may remain until such time that other utility lines and poles are placed underground, at which time an applicant may request that a small wireless facility be installed on a new street light consistent with the requirements of Section 14.62.310 and if no existing street light exists to host the SWF. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.310 Replacement Utility Pole - Street Lighting.

With the express permission of the City, a replacement utility pole or a new utility pole may be permitted in the form of a new street light standard. The design of the street light standard shall be in accordance with adopted City construction standards when located outside of a design zone or underground district. Replacement utility poles/new street light standards located within a design zone shall conform to the adopted streetscape design standard for the design zone and those located within an underground district shall be approved with a concealment element plan. Wherever technologically feasible, all equipment and cabling shall be internal to the replacement or new street lighting standard. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.320 Modifications to Small Wireless Facilities.

(a)    If a grantee desires to make a modification to an existing small wireless facility, including but not limited to expanding or changing the antenna type, increasing the equipment enclosure, placing additional pole-mounted or ground-mounted equipment, or modifying the concealment elements, then the applicant shall apply for a small wireless facility permit.

(b)    A small wireless facility permit shall not be required for routine maintenance and repair of a small wireless facility, or the replacement of an antenna or equipment of similar size, weight, and height; provided, that such replacement does not defeat the concealment elements used in the original deployment of the small wireless facility, does not impact the structural integrity of the pole, and does not require pole replacement. Further, a small wireless facility permit shall not be required for replacing equipment within the equipment enclosure or reconfiguration of fiber or power to the small wireless facility. Right-of-way use permits may be required for such routine maintenance, repair or replacement consistent with Section 14.56.250. (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)


14.62.330 Consolidated Permit.

Small wireless facility permits, and right-of-way permits to allow installment of small cell facilities in the public rights-of-way, may be consolidated through the provisions in Section 14.16A.220(g). (Ord. 1048, Sec. 2 (Att. A), 2019)

14.64.005 Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas.

The City hereby adopts by reference the special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator in a scientific and engineering report titled “The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Snohomish County, Washington, and Incorporated Areas” dated June 19, 2020, and any revisions thereto, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and any revisions thereto, and declare the same to be a part of the Lake Stevens Municipal Code. The FIS and FIRM are on file in the Planning and Community Development Department. (Ord. 1091, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2020; Ord. 1010, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 964, Sec. 3, 2016; Ord. 860, Sec. 4 (Exh. 2), 2011)


14.64.010 Application of Regulations.

(a)    All development in the regulatory floodplain, within the City of Lake Stevens, comprised of the special flood hazard area and all protected areas (i.e., lands within the boundaries of the floodway, the riparian habitat zone, and the channel migration area locally defined and mapped) shall comply with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, State, and Federal regulations including, but not limited to, obtaining necessary permits and approvals.

(b)    The degree of flood protection required is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. There shall be no liability on the part of the City of Lake Stevens, any officer or employee thereof, or FEMA, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this code or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 

(c)    Under the provisions of this chapter, the City will allow an applicant to request permit-specific review as consistent with National Flood Insurance Program regulations contained in 44 CFR 60.3(a)(2) to assess development impacts to floodplain and associated habitat functions and any requested deviations pursuant to the submission of a habitat impact assessment per Section 14.64.055(c) and, if necessary, a habitat mitigation plan per Section 14.64.055(d). Under a permit specific review, the development proposal must otherwise follow the defined administrative review procedures and regulations of this chapter.

(d)    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

(e)    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.20 including but not limited to civil enforcement procedures and penalties.

(f)    This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 1091, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2020; Ord. 1010, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 860, Sec. 4 (Exh. 2), 2011)


14.64.015 Authority and Duties of the Floodplain Administrator.

(a)    The Floodplain Administrator shall be the Planning and Community Development Director, or the Director’s designee, appointed to administer, implement and enforce this chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its provisions.

(b)    Upon receipt of a floodplain development application, the Floodplain Administrator shall compare the project’s site elevation to the base flood elevation. A development project is not subject to the requirements of this chapter if it is located on land outside the protected area and higher than the base flood elevation. 

(c)    The Floodplain Administrator shall determine, where needed, the exact location of the boundaries of the regulatory floodplain, the special flood hazard area, and the protected area when there appears to be a conflict between the mapped special flood hazard area boundary and actual field conditions, as determined by the base flood elevation and ground elevations per the criteria found in Section 14.88.510. The applicant may appeal an administrative interpretation of the boundary location to the hearing examiner in accordance with Section 14.16A.265.

(d)    Where the adopted FIS or FIRM does not include base flood elevation and floodway data for special flood hazard areas, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from Federal, State, and/or other sources.

(e)    The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain, for public inspection, all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter and submit such reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program. (Ord. 1091, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2020; Ord. 1010, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 860, Sec. 4 (Exh. 2), 2011)


14.64.020 Administrative Procedures.

(a)    The City shall require a floodplain development permit before construction and/or development begins within the regulatory floodplain.

(b)    The City shall review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required, provided, the primary responsibility to identify and obtain required permits shall remain with the developer, and the City shall have no liability to the developer should it fail to identify any other permit that is determined to be required by the agency administering such permit.

(c)    Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures.

(d)    For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data are provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in Section 14.64.015(d):

(1)    The proposed elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure will be floodproofed;

(2)    Where a structure is to be floodproofed, certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet floodproofing criteria in Section 14.64.045(c).

(e)    Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

(f)    Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source per Section 14.64.015(d), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

(g)    Applicants shall submit a floodplain development permit, on forms furnished by the City, and shall submit one or more site plans, drawn to scale, including, but not limited to, the following:

(1)    The nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the property in question;

(2)    Names and locations of all lakes, water bodies, waterways and drainage facilities within 300 feet of the site;

(3)    The elevations of the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year floods, where the data are available;

(4)    The boundaries of the regulatory floodplain, special flood hazard area, floodway, riparian habitat zone, and channel migration area, as appropriate;

(5)    The proposed drainage system including, but not limited to, storm sewers, overland flow paths, detention facilities and roads;

(6)    Existing and proposed structures, fill, pavement and other impervious surfaces, and sites for storage of materials;

(7)    Critical areas per Chapter 14.88; and

(8)    Existing native vegetation and proposed revegetation.

(h)    The applicant must record a notice on title that the property contains land within the regulatory floodplain including special flood hazard areas and protected areas, as applicable, before the City issues the floodplain development permit.

(i)    The City shall notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(j)    The City shall assure that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

(k)    Base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the Floodplain Administrator shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with 44 CFR 65.3. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data.

(l)    Notify the Federal Insurance Administrator in writing of acquisition by means of annexation, incorporation or otherwise, of additional areas of jurisdiction. (Ord. 1091, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2020; Ord. 1010, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 964, Sec. 4, 2016; Ord. 860, Sec. 4 (Exh. 2), 2011)


14.64.025 Conformance with Chapter 14.88 (Critical Areas), Chapter 14.92 (Shoreline Management), Section 14.16C.100 (Shoreline Permits), and the Shoreline Master Program.

Uses permitted within regulatory floodplain must also be consistent with Chapter 14.88, Chapter 14.92, Section 14.16C.100 and the Shoreline Master Program. Wherever regulations conflict in these chapters, the more restrictive provisions shall prevail. The intent of this section is to prevent development that is inconsistent with Chapter 14.88, Chapter 14.92, Section 14.16C.100 and the Shoreline Master Program even though it may seem permissible according to the regulations of this chapter. (Ord. 1091, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2020; Ord. 1010, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 860, Sec. 4 (Exh. 2), 2011)

(1)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(2)    Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 1091, Sec. 3 (Exh. B), 2020)

14.68.084 Changeable Text Signs.

(a)    Changeable text signs are permanent sign fixtures with non-changing sign faces on non-moving text consisting of opaque individual letters mounted on plexiglass or similar materials may manually be periodically changed (e.g., for short term sales or specials). While the fixture must be permitted, the text may change without a permit as long as it fits within the dimensional parameters of the fixture.

(b)    Changeable text signs are permissible in the Local Business, Central Business District, Sub-Regional Commercial, and Public/Semi-Public districts, except that churches, synagogues, and temples (use class 5.200) may have a changeable text sign in any zone district in which they may be located, provided such sign is not internally illuminated. Each occupant may have changeable text signs, though the total aggregate surface area of such sign(s) may not exceed 10 percent of the occupants’ total allowable permitted signage. (Ord. 799, Sec. 2, 2009; Ord. 676, Sec. 58, 2003; Ord. 661, 2002; Ord. 468, 1995)

(Ord. 903, Sec. 46, 2013; Ord. 799, Sec. 2, 2009; Ord. 676, Sec. 59, 2003; Ord. 661, 2002; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.68.120 Miscellaneous Restrictions and Prohibitions.

(a)    The following restrictions apply to all signs except those exempt from regulation (Section 14.68.020) and except those exempt from permits specifically identified below.

(b)    No off-premises signs may be located in any district except:

(1)    Those exempted from regulation or from permit requirements under Section 14.68.020 or 14.68.030; and

(2)    City-sponsored “City Center/Welcome” signs identifying the location of the historic downtown and the general types of businesses and services available.

(c)    Signs located within residential zone districts are prohibited unless specifically allowed elsewhere in this chapter.

(d)    No sign may be located so that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for motorists to proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit streets. Freestanding and portable signs may not be placed within a vehicular sight distance triangle at the intersection of any streets. This triangle connects the intersection of the paved or traveled surface of the roadways with each of the two points measured 30 feet from the intersection along the edge of the respective paved or traveled surface of each roadway.

(e)    Signs that are designed to revolve or are animated or that utilize movement or apparent movement to attract the attention of the public are prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, banners, streamers, pennants, and propellers are prohibited, but signs that only move occasionally because of wind are not prohibited if their movement (1) is not a primary design feature of the sign, and (2) is not intended to attract attention to the sign. The restriction of this subsection shall not apply to barber poles or signs specified in Section 14.68.030(a)(5).

(f)    No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape, nature, or message it would tend to obstruct the view of or be confused with official traffic signs or other signs erected by governmental agencies.

(g)    Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other substantial supportive structure so that there is virtually no danger that either the sign or the supportive structure may be moved by the wind or other forces of nature and cause injury to persons or property. 

(h)    Animated display boards shall be subject to the following limitations:

(1)    They are prohibited in residential zone districts.

(2)    No more than one animated display board per establishment is allowed.

(3)    The maximum area of a sign with an animated display board shall be 50 square feet. The maximum area of the animated display portion of the sign shall be 40 percent of the sign of which it is a part.

(4)    Animated display boards shall convey text messages only. Graphic images are prohibited. Movement of text messages is allowed to transition to other messages. However, repeated flashing of the same message is prohibited. (Ord. 799, Sec. 2, 2009; Ord. 676, Sec. 60, 2003; Ord. 661, Sec. 4, 2002; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.68.124 Incentive Provisions for Exceptional Efforts.

(a)    To encourage the integration of signage into the visual framework of its location, special consideration may be given to signs of exceptional design. Special consideration may, at the Planning Director’s discretion, result in a relaxation of the number, dimensional and locational standards specified in this chapter. No other standards may be relaxed. This is not to be confused with a variance. It is to be based on an exceptional effort toward creating visual harmony between the sign, the building(s), and the site.

(b)    Petitions for consideration of signs pursuant to this section shall be made to and decided by the Planning Director. The petition and application shall be presented with the entire sign plan to the Design Review Board with a narrative outlining the proposed plan addressing, but not limited to, the following:

(1)    How the components of the sign improve legibility, readability, and aesthetics;

(2)    The relationship of the proposed sign to the community vision for the zone, as expressed in the Comprehensive Plan, intent of the zone, and Development Design Guidelines. In the Central Business District in particular, signs designed to enhance the historic character of downtown may be given special consideration; 

(3)    Relationship of the sign to the immediate surroundings, including existing and proposed buildings, other signs, and landscape;

(4)    Relationship of the sign to the business that the sign is to promote; and

(5)    A colored rendering, showing the proposed sign, dimensions of the sign, and location of the sign. (Ord. 876, Sec. 21, 2012; Ord. 799, Sec. 2, 2009; Ord. 661, Sec. 4, 2002; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.68.130 Maintenance of Signs.

(a)    All signs and structural components shall be kept in a state of good repair.

(b)    If a sign advertises an entity, service, or goods or other activity that is no longer available on the site, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other party having control over such sign.

(c)    If the message portion of a sign is removed, leaving only the supporting “shell” of a sign or the supporting braces, anchors, or similar components, the owner of the sign or the owner of the property where the sign is located or other person having control over such sign shall, within 30 days of the removal of the message portion of the sign, either replace the entire message portion of the sign or remove the remaining components of the sign. This subsection shall not be construed to alter the effect of Section 14.68.150(c), which prohibits the replacement of a nonconforming sign, nor shall this subsection be construed to prevent the changing of the message of a sign. (Ord. 903, Sec. 47, 2013; Ord. 799, Sec. 2, 2009)


14.68.140 Unlawful Cutting of Trees or Shrubs.

No person may, for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of any sign, damage, trim, destroy, or remove any trees, shrubs, or other vegetation located:

(a)    Within the right-of-way of any public street or road, unless the work is done pursuant to the express written authorization of the Planning Director;

(b)    On property that is not under the ownership or control of the person doing or responsible for such work, unless the work is done pursuant to the express authorization of the person owning the property where such trees or shrubs are located;

(c)    In any area where such trees or shrubs are required to remain under a permit issued under this title;

(d)    In any area encumbered by a native growth protection easement or similar easement prohibiting the removal of trees or vegetation. (Ord. 799, Sec. 2, 2009)


14.68.150 Nonconforming Signs.

(a)    Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be continued.

(b)    No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition. Nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign.

(c)    A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this title.

(d)    If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this title, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is “destroyed” if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign so damaged.

(e)    The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformities (for example, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed).

(f)    Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12-month period 50 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign.

(g)    If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed within 30 days after such abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other party having control over such sign.

(h)    If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with this chapter or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is “blank” if:

(1)    It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; or

(2)    The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part; or

(3)    The advertising copy paid for by a party other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed.

(i)    The burden of establishing a sign to be legally nonconforming or not destroyed under this section rests upon the person or persons, firm, or corporation claiming legal status for a sign.

(j)    As soon as reasonably possible after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, the Planning Director shall make every reasonable effort to identify all the nonconforming signs within the City’s planning jurisdiction. He shall then contact the person responsible for each such sign (as well as the owner of the property where the nonconforming sign is located, if different from the former) and inform such person (1) that the sign is nonconforming, (2) how it is nonconforming, (3) what must be done to correct it and by what date, and (4) the consequences of failure to make the necessary corrections. The Planning Director shall keep complete records of all correspondence, communications, and other actions taken with respect to such nonconforming signs. However, performing these actions in no way releases the sign owner from the burden established in subsection (i) of this section.

14.72.010 Number of Parking Spaces Required.

(a)    All developments in all zoning districts other than the Central Business District shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question.

(b)    The presumptions established by this chapter are that: (1) a development must comply with the parking standards set forth in subsection (e) of this section to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection (a) of this section, and (2) any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, Table 14.72-I, Table of Parking Requirements, is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered, as provided in Section 14.72.020.

(c)    Uses in the Table of Parking Requirements (subsection (e) of this section) are indicated by a numerical reference keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses, Section 14.40.010. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by this table results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.

(d)    The Council recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements set forth in subsection (e) of this section cannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the permit issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table as a guide.

(e)    Table of Parking Requirements. Table 14.72-I describes the number of off-street parking stalls required for the various permissible uses.

(Ord. 1030, Sec. 2 (Exh. B), 2018; Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 666, Sec 11, 2002; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.72.020 Flexibility in Administration Required.

(a)    The Council recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Section 14.72.010(e) may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in Section 14.72.010, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Section 14.72.010(e) and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 14.72.010(a).

(b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Section 14.72.010(e) when it finds that:

(1)    A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly or other demographic group which, due to the driving characteristics of the group, requires fewer or more parking stalls than the general populace;

(2)    A sole business (not part of a larger mall) is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.

(c)    Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in Section 14.72.010(e), it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.

(d)    If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by Section 14.72.010(e) for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 14.16C.075. (Ord. 811, Sec. 67, 2010)


14.72.030 Parking Space Dimensions.

(a)    Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least 19 feet long and nine feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section.

(b)    In parking areas containing 10 or more parking spaces, up to 20 percent of the parking spaces need only contain a rectangular area of only seven and one-half feet in width by 15 feet in length. If such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only.

(c)    Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than 22 feet by eight feet.


14.72.040 Required Widths of Parking Area Aisles and Driveways.

(a)    Parking area aisle widths shall conform to Table 14.72-II, which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking.

(b)    Driveways shall be not less than 10 feet in width for one-way traffic and 20 feet in width for two-way traffic, except that 10-feet-wide driveways are permissible for two-way traffic when (1) the driveway is not longer than 50 feet, (2) it provides access to not more than six spaces, and (3) sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back into a public street. (Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010)

 

Table 14.72-II: Parking Aisle Widths 

	 	Parking Angle

	Aisle Width	0°	30°	45°	60°	90°

	One-Way Traffic	13	11	13	18	24

	Two-Way Traffic	19	20	21	23	24

(Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010)


14.72.050 General Design Requirements.

(a)    Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged.

(b)    Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements.

(c)    Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction.

(d)    Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.


14.72.060 Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces.

(a)    Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, all vehicle accommodation areas shall be graded and surfaced with asphalt, concrete or other material that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion, and dust. Specifications for surfaces meeting the standard set forth in this subsection are contained in the administrative guideline entitled “Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces.”

(b)    Within the Light Industrial or General Industrial Districts where a proposed use is (1) clearly non-permanent (i.e., no permanent structure is proposed) and is not anticipated to be a permanent use, and (2) is not required to have more than 10 parking spaces per the Table of Parking Requirements, and (3) the parking spaces are not to be used regularly at least five days per week, then the vehicle accommodation areas that contain parking areas need not be paved as specified in subsection (a) of this section. Instead, the vehicle accommodation area may be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, or other suitable material (as provided in the specifications set forth in the administrative guideline entitled “Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces”) to provide a surface that is stable and will help to reduce dust and erosion. The perimeter of such parking areas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other similar devices. In addition, whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved street, the driveway leading from such street to such area (or, if there is no driveway, the portion of the vehicle accommodation area that opens onto such streets), shall be paved as provided in subsection (a) of this section for a distance of 15 feet back from the edge of the paved street. This subsection shall not apply to single-family or two-family residences or other uses that are required to have only one or two parking spaces.

(c)    Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings. Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection (b) of this section shall be demarcated whenever practicable.

(d)    Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good condition (free from potholes, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and distinct.


14.72.070 Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces.

(a)    One parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use.

(b)    To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally 90 percent vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with 90 percent of the spaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to 50 percent of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make use of 50 percent of the church lot’s spaces on those other days.

(c)    If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 14.72.080 are also applicable.


14.72.080 Satellite Parking.

(a)    If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this title cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as satellite parking spaces.

(b)    All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking, or within 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance.

(c)    The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.

(d)    Persons who obtain satellite parking spaces in accordance with this section shall not be held accountable for ensuring that the satellite parking areas from which they obtain their spaces satisfy the design requirements of this chapter.


14.72.090 Special Provisions For Lots With Existing Buildings.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, whenever (a) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this title, and (b) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (c) the parking requirements of Section 14.72.010 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking, then the developer need only comply with the requirements of Section 14.72.010 to the extent that (a) parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located, and (b) satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in Section 14.72.070. However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available.


14.72.100 Loading and Unloading Areas.

(a)    Subject to subsection (e) of this section, whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner.

(b)    The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in question. Table 14-72-III indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard set forth in this subsection. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more or less loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard.

(c)    Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use them can (1) maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and (2) complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or any parking space or parking lot aisle.

(d)    No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities.

(e)    Whenever (1) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this title, and (2) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (3) the loading area requirements of this section cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for loading and unloading, then the developer need only comply with this section to the extent reasonably possible. (Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 468, 1995)

*Minimum dimensions of 12 feet x 55 feet and overhead clearance of 14 feet from street grade required.

(Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010)


14.72.110 Bicycle Parking Facilities.

(a)    All multifamily uses in excess of four units shall provide parking facilities for bicycles at a ratio of 1 stall per dwelling unit.

(b)    All commercial and public uses shall provide a minimum of two stalls for bicycles per business address, or 10 percent of the required automobile parking spaces required for a business or group of businesses. The choice of which method to apply shall be based upon a finding made by the permit-issuing authority, after consulting with the business owner, as to the potential demand for such facilities which will be generated by the business or group of businesses. After 20 stalls have been provided by any business or group of businesses, the ratio shall be five percent of the total required automobile parking spaces.

(c)    A bicycle stall shall include a delineated and safe parking area, and an appropriate structure to which bicycles can be locked.

(d)    The above requirements may be reduced by the permit-issuing authority if they can be shown to be unwarranted. The decision of said permit-issuing authority may be appealed to City Council. (Ord. 516, 1996; Ord. 511, Sec. 18, 1996)

Part I.    Screening


14.76.010 Council Findings Concerning the Need for Screening Requirements.

The Council finds that:

(1)    Screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust, and glare.

(2)    Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area. Even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces, and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use.

(3)    Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening.

(4)    The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.020 General Screening Standard.

Every development which abuts a different zone district shall provide sufficient screening so that:

(1)    Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development;

(2)    The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses in unlike zones. (Ord. 676, Sec. 61, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.030 Compliance With Screening Standard.

(a)    The type of screening required is based on the adjacent zoning designations. Table 14.76-I contains the list of zone districts

(b)    Required screening shall be installed at the time of new development, change of use, or increase in building area or site use of an existing use.

(c)    No screening is required along public streets in places where the zone district boundary is located along such streets. (Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 676, Sec. 62, 2003; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.040 Definition of Screens.

(a)    Below are the definitions for the three types of screens. In general, the screens may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. The use of vegetative screens will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the particular species. The areas in which of intermittent visual obstruction is required may contain deciduous plants.

(1)    Opaque screen with buffer, Type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide. In addition, a Type A screen includes a minimum ten-foot-wide landscaped planting strip parallel and adjacent to the property line where the screening is required. 

(2)    Semi-opaque screen with buffer, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide. In addition, a Type B screen includes a minimum five-foot-wide landscaped planting strip parallel and adjacent to the property line where the screening is required. 

(3)    Broken screen, Type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. (Ord. 676, Sec. 63, 2003; Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.050 Table of Screening Requirements.

See Table 14.76-I. (Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 468, 1995)

14.76.080 Subdivisions.

(Deleted by Ord. 676, Sec. 66, 2003)


14.76.090 Additional Screening Requirements.

(a)    Due to the potential for adverse impacts between the following noncompatible uses, a 30-foot-wide landscaped screen shall be maintained between State Route 204, State Route 92 and/or State Route 9 and all residential and industrial uses.

(b)    Due to the potential for adverse impacts, Light Industrial and General Industrial zoned properties directly abutting the Centennial Trail shall provide a Type A screen, pursuant to Section 14.76.040(a)(1) in areas abutting the Centennial Trail.

(c)    The screen shall have a height of at least 30 feet at maturity. It is intended to exclude all visual and noise contact between uses in all seasons of the year. The use of existing significant trees which are not prone to windthrow within the screen is strongly encouraged.

(d)    The Planning Director may approve reduced buffer widths to prevent denial of all reasonable use of property. (Ord. 908, Sec. 9, 2014; Ord. 903, Sec. 48, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 68, 2010; Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 511, Sec. 17, 1996)

Part II.    Shading


14.76.100 Council Findings and Declaration of Policy on Shade Trees.

(a)    The Council finds that:

(1)    Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival;

(2)    Trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe;

(3)    Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems;

(4)    Trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing through the ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers;

(5)    Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control;

(6)    Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land, particularly parking areas; and

(7)    For the reasons indicated in subsection (a)(6) of this section, trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values.

(b)    Based upon these findings, the Council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working within the City to protect certain existing trees and to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments. (Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.110 Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets.

Along both sides of all newly created, widened, or improved streets, the developer shall either plant or retain within the landscape strip every 30 feet of street frontage one deciduous tree of two inches dbh at the time of planting, with a canopy that starts at least eight feet above finished grade and will have a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter when fully mature. Root deflectors shall be provided for all street trees. When trees are planted by the developer pursuant to this section, the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the administrative guideline entitled “Guide for Landscaping.” Paving or covering the landscape strip with impervious material or to park motor vehicles on the landscape strip is prohibited. (Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.120 Retention and Protection of Large Trees.

(a)    Every development shall retain all existing significant trees and significant stands of trees unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development or in the opinion of the Planning Director cause a significant safety problem. The applicant for a land use permit or preliminary subdivision approval shall, with the application, submit an assessment prepared by a certified arborist, which makes recommendations for protection of trees consistent with this chapter.

(b)    The retention of significant trees and significant stands of trees unreasonably burdens a development if the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer.

(c)    Where significant trees and significant stands of trees are removed because their retention would unreasonably burden a development, a tree survey shall be provided, showing size, type, and location of all significant trees and stands of trees. Prior to removal, the developer shall coordinate with the City which trees are to be protected.

(d)    Any unprotected significant trees removed shall be replaced with one-gallon-sized native species at a ratio of 3:1. During plat and home construction the developer shall provide adequate protection of retained and replacement trees from damage.

(e)    If it is physically impractical to replant all replacement trees on site, then the applicant shall mitigate the loss of trees by either planting trees on public property within the City as approved by the planning director, and/or paying a mitigation fee into the City’s tree mitigation in-lieu fund. This fee shall be set forth in the City’s fee resolution, and equal the cost of purchasing and planting the trees.

(f)    Prior to any clearing activities, the city shall map and inventory all trees identified for protection. If any of the protected trees are removed or damaged to the extent that their ability to survive is seriously threatened, without the City’s prior written consent, the loss shall be remedied pursuant to Section 14.28.040(c).

(g)    Replacement trees approved to be installed on public property shall be planted prior to recordation of a final plat, or issuance of a building permit, whichever comes first.

(h)    Replacement trees approved to be installed on residential lots shall be planted prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for that lot.

(i)    If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in Chapter 14.72 cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, up to a maximum of 15 percent of the required spaces.

(j)    Whenever construction, clearing or grading activities occur on a site in which trees are required to be protected pursuant to this title, the following measures shall be taken to ensure said protection:

(1)    Prior to commencing any site work, the applicant shall submit a plan to the Department of Planning and Community Development which identifies types and locations of barriers that will be placed around protected trees to aid in the avoidance of accidental damage to the trees. No site work will commence prior to the City inspecting and approving the location and installation of the barriers.

(2)    No fill, excavation or other subsurface disturbance, operating, stacking or storing of equipment or compacting of earth may be undertaken within the drip line of any of the protected trees, and no impervious surface may be located within 12 1/2 feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more. A drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground.

(3)    Where vehicular/equipment access is required within the drip line of a tree, the soil, and incidentally the tree’s roots, shall be protected with 10 inches of woodchips and/or plywood placed over the path of the vehicle to limit soil compaction and subsequent root damage. Before any vehicles may travel through the protected area, the developer shall submit an affidavit from a certified arborist that measures installed are sufficient to protect the tree(s) in question.

(4)    Stumps of trees to be removed within one-half of the radius of the critical root zone (CRZ), which is defined as CRZ equals one foot radius for every one inch of the tree’s diameter, shall not be excavated but may be ground down to below the ground surface.

(5)    Unwanted vegetation within the CRZ of a protected tree shall be removed by hand.

(6)    Backfilling into a CRZ of a protected tree shall be done only with the written approval of a certified arborist. Only well drained soil with sufficient air space (sandy soils) are permitted.

(7)    Upon completion of site clearing, protected trees may be pruned for deadwood, low hanging limbs and proper balance under the supervision of a certified arborist. Trees may be cabled and braced as recommended by the arborist. (Ord. 903, Sec. 49, 2013; Ord. 666, Sec. 13, 2002; Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 596, 1999; Ord. 468, 1995)


14.76.124 Shade Trees on Residential Lots.

(a)    Each residential lot shall maintain a minimum number of trees on site. This section shall be enforced at the time that any land use or building permit is issued. If fewer than the required trees exist on a lot for which a land use or building permit is applied, the granting of the permit shall be conditioned on the planting of trees to meet the requirements of this section.

(b)    The minimum number of required trees depends on the zoning district in which the site falls, as follows:

Suburban Residential, Waterfront Residential - three trees/lot

Urban Residential, High Urban Residential - two trees/lot

Except: lots developed through a Planned Residential Development (Section 14.44.020) or a Cluster Subdivision (Section 14.48.070) - three trees/lot for lots greater than or equal to 9,600 square feet, two trees/lot for lots less than 9,600 square feet

(c)    If street trees are present, or are required to be installed with a development, they may count toward one of the trees required by subsection (b) of this section.

(d)    On lake front properties only, one of the required trees may be substituted by installing and maintaining natural aquatic vegetation along the water’s edge. The minimum area of the vegetation shall be 20 square feet.

(e)    Nonstreet trees required per this section shall be a native species, have a minimum two-inch diameter at breast height (dbh), and attain a minimum height of 25 feet at maturity.

(f)    At least one of the required trees shall be planted near the rear property line of the lot. The intent of this regulation is to create rows of trees behind and between rows of houses, thus affording privacy and creating a forested view of the community when seen from ground level. (Ord. 811, Sec. 69, 2010; Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 596, 1999)


14.76.130 Shade Trees in Parking Areas.

(a)    Paved vehicle accommodation areas must be shaded by deciduous trees that will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter. The developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the administrative guideline entitled “Guide for Landscaping.” 

(b)    Each tree of the type described in subsection (a) of this section shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of 15 feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, 20 percent of the vehicle accommodation area will be shaded.

(c)    Except as noted in subsection (d) of this section, no paving may be placed within 12 1/2 feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of any tree retained to comply with subsection (a) of this section. 

(d)    Pervious paving (grasscrete, metal grating, etc.) may be used within 12 1/2 feet of a tree if (1) the parking lot is designed so that no significant run-off from the paved areas drains into the area around the base of the tree(s) and (2) barriers are placed in such a manner as to prevent vehicles from damaging such trees.

(e)    Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking trees. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three feet, six inches. (Ord. 639, Sec. 4, 2001; Ord. 590, 1998; Ord. 468, 1995)

14.88.010 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to designate, classify, and protect the critical areas of the Lake Stevens community by establishing regulations and standards for development and use of properties which contain or adjoin critical areas for protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. The purpose and intent of this chapter is also to ensure that there is no net loss of the acreage or functions and values of critical areas regulated by this chapter.

(a)    A project proponent shall make all reasonable efforts to avoid and minimize impacts to critical areas and buffers in the following sequential order of preference:

(1)    Avoiding impacts altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; or

(2)    When avoidance is not possible, minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocations, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts and mitigating for the affected functions and values of the critical area; and

(3)    Reducing or eliminating impacts over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.

(4)    Compensating for unavoidable impacts by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments.

(b)    Protect the public from personal injury, loss of life, or property damage due to flooding, erosion, landslides, seismic events, or soil subsidence.

(c)    Protect against publicly financed expenditures due to the misuse of critical areas which cause:

(1)    Unnecessary maintenance and replacement of public facilities;

(2)    Publicly funded mitigation of avoidable impacts;

(3)    Cost for public emergency rescue and relief operations where the causes are avoidable;

Unless specifically prohibited elsewhere in this chapter, the following uses are allowed in any critical area or buffer; provided, that a site/resource-specific report prepared when the activity may result in a loss of functions and values, that describes the environmental limitations of and proposed mitigation for the site, shall be submitted, reviewed, and approved by the City prior to permit issuance or land use approval:

(a)    Existing and ongoing agricultural activities; provided, that they implement applicable best management practices (BMPs) contained in the latest editions of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG); or develop a farm conservation plan in coordination with the local conservation district. BMPs and/or farm plans should address potential impacts from livestock, nutrient and farm chemicals, soil erosion and sediment control and agricultural drainage infrastructure. BMPs and/or farm plans should ensure that ongoing agricultural activities minimize their effects on water quality, riparian ecology, salmonid populations and wildlife habitat. 

(b)    Those activities and uses conducted pursuant to the Washington State Forest Practices Act and its rules and regulations, WAC 222-12-030, where state law specifically exempts local authority, except those developments requiring local approval for Class IV – General Forest Practice Permits (conversions) as defined in Chapter 76.09 RCW and Chapter 222-12 WAC. 

(c)    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of existing topography, water conditions, or water sources. 

(d)    Enhancement of a wetland through the removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved mechanical, biological or chemical treatments. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species. 

(e)    Educational and scientific research activities.

(f)    Public and Private Pedestrian Trails.

(1)    Trails may be constructed within the outer 25 percent of the critical area buffers to wetlands and fish and wildlife conservation areas, except that trails may be located within the remainder of the critical area buffer when it is demonstrated through the site/resource-specific report that:

(i)    No other alternative for the trail location exists which would provide the same educational and/or scientific research opportunities; and

(k)    Minor expansion of uses or structures existing at the time of adoption of this code, and which are in compliance with all other chapters of this title; provided, that the applicant obtains all required local, State, and Federal permits, including but not limited to a Department of Fish and Wildlife Hydraulic Permit and a Clean Water Act 404 Permit, and the expansion does not create a loss of critical area and functions nor pose a significant threat to water quality. A site/resource-specific report and mitigation plan shall be prepared to describe the critical area, function, and water quality and submitted to the City for review and approval prior to permit issuance. For the purposes of this subsection, “minor expansion” refers to an addition to or alteration of a use or structure and shall be limited to a maximum of 1,000 square feet of impervious area.

(l)    Stormwater Management Facilities. Dispersion outfalls, bioswales and other low impact facilities may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer to wetlands and fish and wildlife and conservation areas, when the location of such facilities will not degrade the function or values of the critical area based on the recommendation of a qualified professional for the specific critical area type. Stormwater management facilities in geologically hazardous areas shall be constructed in a manner that does not increase the risk of landslide or erosion in accordance with an approved geotechnical report.

(m)    Emergency Activities. Those activities that are necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare or pose an immediate risk of damage to private property, and that require remedial or preventative action in a time frame too short to allow for compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

(n)    Development when the subject property is separated from a critical area by preexisting, intervening, and lawfully created structures, public roads, or other substantial improvements. The preexisting improvements must be found to separate the subject property from the critical area or impair the delivery of buffer functions. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.230 Compliance.

All land uses or development applications shall be reviewed to determine whether or not a critical area exists on the property for which the application is filed, what the action’s impacts to any existing critical area would be, and what actions are required for compliance with this chapter. No construction activity, including land clearing or grading, shall be permitted until the information required by this section is reviewed and a plan is approved by the City. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.235 Best Available Science.

(a)    Criteria for Best Available Science. The best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local, State or Federal natural resource agencies, a qualified scientific professional, or team of qualified scientific professionals, that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925.

(b)    Protection of Functions and Values and Fish Usage. Critical area studies and decisions to alter critical areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and values of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish and their habitat, such as salmon and bull trout.

(c)    Lack of Scientific Information. Where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area leading to uncertainty about the risk to critical area function or permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area, the City shall:

(1)    Take a precautionary or no-risk approach that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved; and

(2)    Require application of an effective adaptive management program that relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and nonregulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberative scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty. To effectively implement an adaptive management program, the City hereby commits to:

(i)    Address funding for the research component of the adaptive management program;

(ii)    Change course based on the results and interpretation of new information that resolves uncertainties; and

(iii)    Commit to the appropriate time frame and scale necessary to reliably evaluate regulatory and nonregulatory actions affecting protection of critical areas and anadromous fisheries. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

(2)    The bank is certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC;

(3)    The Department determines that the mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts and that at minimum all proposals using a mitigation bank shall have made reasonable efforts to avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and buffers through sequencing;

(4)    The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification; 

(5)    The compensatory mitigation agreement occurs in advance of authorized impacts;

(6)    Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification; and

(7)     The use of the mitigation bank will result in equivalent treatment of the functions and values of the critical area or buffer to offset the impacts on the project site such that the total net impact will be no net loss of critical area functions and values in the watershed in which the impacts will occur.

(b)    In-lieu fee mitigation shall be established in accordance with the guidance contained in “Guidance on In-lieu Fee Mitigation” (Washington State Department of Ecology, December 2012, or latest edition, Publication No. 12-06-012) based upon the following order of preference:

(1)    A City or County approved program that gives priority to sites that will expand or improve habitat for Lake Stevens and associated tributaries;

(2)    A City or County approved program that utilizes receiving mitigation sites within the same subbasin as the approved impact; and

(3)    A City or County approved program that gives priority to sites within the same subbasin and/or a predefined service area that includes the City of Lake Stevens. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019)


14.88.277 Mitigation Monitoring.

(a)    All compensatory mitigation projects shall be monitored for the period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but in no event for less than five years following the acceptance of the installation/construction by the Planning and Community Development Director or designee.

(b)    Monitoring reports on the status of the mitigation project shall be submitted to the Planning and Community Development Department. The reports shall be prepared by a qualified consultant and shall include monitoring information on wildlife, vegetation, water quality, water flow, stormwater storage and conveyance, and existing or potential degradation. Reports shall be submitted in accordance with the following schedule:

(1)    At the time of construction;

(2)    Thirty days after planting;

(3)    Early in the growing season of the first year;

(4)    End of the growing season of the first year;

(c)    The Planning and Community Development Director or designee shall have the authority to extend the monitoring and surety period and require additional monitoring reports and maintenance activities beyond the initial five-year monitoring period for any project that involves one or a combination of the following factors:

(1)    Creation or restoration of forested wetland or buffer communities;

(2)    Failure to meet the performance standards identified in the mitigation plan;

(3)    Failure to provide adequate replacement for the functions and values of the impacted critical area; or if 

(4)    Additional monitoring is warranted. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008)


14.88.278 Bonding (Security Mechanism).

(a)    If the development proposal is subject to compensatory mitigation, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City to complete the mitigation plan approved by the City and shall post a mitigation performance surety to ensure mitigation is fully functional.

(b)    The surety shall be in the amount of 150 percent of the estimated cost of the uncompleted actions or the estimated cost of restoring the functions and values of the critical area that are at risk, whichever is greater. The surety shall be based on a detailed, itemized cost estimate of the mitigation activity including clearing and grading, plant materials, plant installation, irrigation, weed management, monitoring and all other costs.

(c)    The surety shall be in the form of an assignment of funds, bond, security device, or other means acceptable to the City Finance Director in consultation with the City Attorney.

(d)    The performance surety authorized by this section shall remain in effect until the City determines, in writing, that the permit conditions, code requirements and/or standards bonded for have been met. Once the mitigation installation has been accepted by the Director or designee, the bond may be reduced to 20 percent of the original mitigation cost estimate and shall become a maintenance surety. Said maintenance surety shall generally be held by the City for a period of five years to ensure that the required mitigation has been fully implemented and demonstrated to function, and may be held for longer periods under Section 14.88.277(c).

(e)    Depletion, failure, or collection of surety funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant to complete required mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.

(f)    Public development proposals shall be relieved from having to comply with the bonding requirements of this section if public funds have previously been committed for mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.

(g)    Any failure to satisfy critical area requirements established by law or condition including, but not limited to, the failure to provide a monitoring report within 30 days after it is due or comply with other provisions of an approved mitigation plan shall constitute a default. Upon notice of any default, the City may demand immediate payment of any financial guarantees or require other action authorized by the City code or any other law.

(h)    Any funds paid or recovered pursuant to this section shall be used to complete the required mitigation or other authorized action.

(i)    The Director or designee may authorize a one-time temporary delay, up to 180 days, in completing mitigation activities when environmental conditions could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties. The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation. The request for the temporary delay shall include a written justification documenting the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan and shall include a financial guarantee. The justification shall be verified by the City before approval of any delay.

(j)    The provisions of Section 14.16A.180 (Security Mechanisms) shall also apply if necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public interest. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 811, Sec. 73, 2010; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008)

(2)    For development proposals that do not segregate lots, the permit holder shall record a native growth protection area easement with the Snohomish County Auditor stating the location of and the limitations associated with all of the critical areas and associated buffers or mitigation sites on the property. Restrictions and limitations shall be stated on the face of the deed applicable to the property and recorded with the Snohomish County Auditor.

(c)    Such easements or tracts shall cover the critical area as delineated by its defined boundaries and buffers. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.295 Permanent Protection for Streams, Wetlands and Buffers.

All streams and wetlands under this chapter and their required buffers shall be permanently protected by designating them as native growth protection areas (NGPAs) in accordance with Section 14.88.290. NGPAs are to be left permanently undisturbed in a substantially or environmentally enhanced natural state. No clearing, grading, filling, building construction or placement, or road construction is allowed except the following:

(a)    On a case by case basis when supported by a critical areas assessment study, crossings for underground utility lines which utilize the shortest alignment possible and for which no alignment that would avoid such a crossing is feasible.

(b)    Removal of hazardous trees by the property owner, when based on a recommendation by a qualified arborist and an assessment of hazardous tree risk study and when approved by the City.

(1)    Any trees removed in an NGPA shall be replaced per Section 14.76.120, at a 3:1 ratio or at a 1.5:1 ratio when four-to-six-foot-tall native evergreen trees are planted with the total count being rounded up to the next whole number.

(2)    Any tree removed should only be cut to a point that it does not present a danger to adjacent properties or structures but can provide wildlife habitat.

(c)    Existing legally (ongoing) established structures, and nonnative or ornamental landscaping, including, but not necessarily limited to, gardens, yards, pastures, and orchards, are not required to be designated as NGPAs. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.297 Limited On-Site Density Transfer for Critical Areas.

On-site density transfers may be permitted when critical areas are located on the property subject to the following provisions:

(a)    Only the area contained in the following critical areas and their associated buffers are eligible to be used in the density transfer calculation:

(1)    Category II, III, and IV wetlands; 

(2)    Fish and wildlife conservation areas; and

(3)    Geologically hazardous areas, not approved for alteration.

(b)    The development must be proposed to connect to sewer service and sewer service must be available.

(c)    The base density shall be consistent with the densities set forth in Chapter 14.36 for the zoning districts. The site density shall be calculated using the area of the subject property divided by the minimum lot size of the applicable zone.

(d)    The overall density of the proposed site may be transferred from the undevelopable portion to the developable part of the site and the development when the development is not using other allowed reductions or modifications to critical areas and buffers defined in this chapter.

(e)    The development shall meet applicable policies, setbacks and other standards of the City except:

(1)    The minimum lot size of the underlying zoning district may be reduced by 30 percent in order to accommodate the transfer in densities;

(2)    Lot widths of Chapter 14.48, Table 14.48-I may not be less than 40 feet;

(3)    The front setbacks specified in Chapter 14.48, Table 14.48-I may be reduced by five feet, but in no instance may the garage setback be less than 19 feet;

(4)    The proposed development must be compatible with the character of the area and adjacent uses; and

(5)    The area to which density is transferred must not be constrained by other critical areas. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008)


14.88.298 Innovative Development Design.

A project permit applicant may request approval of an innovative design, which addresses wetland, fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer treatment in a manner that deviates from the standards set forth in Sections 14.88.400 through 14.88.440, Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas, and Sections 14.88.800 through 14.88.840, Wetlands.

(a)    An innovative development design will be considered in conjunction with the primary land use project approval or building permit approval, when the project is consistent with subsection (b) of this section. An applicant may include the innovative development design proposal in the project pre-application review packet for review.

(b)    The applicant shall demonstrate in a site/resource-specific report required pursuant to Section 14.88.270 how the innovative development design complies with the following requirements:

(1)    The innovative development design will achieve protection equivalent to or better than the treatment of the functions and values of the critical areas that would be obtained by applying the standard prescriptive measures contained in this chapter;

(2)    Applicants for innovative development design must consider measures prescribed in guidance documents, such as watershed conservation plans or other similar conservation plans, and low impact stormwater management strategies which address wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or buffer protection consistent with this chapter;

(3)    The innovative development design will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare or injurious to other properties or improvements located outside of the subject property; and

(4)    Applicants for innovative development design are encouraged to consider measures prescribed in the Puget Sound Action Team 2012 Technical Guidance Manual for Low Impact Development or as amended. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008)


14.88.300 Dedication of Land and/or Easements in Lieu of Park Mitigation.

The dedication of critical areas and their buffers as open space may not be used to satisfy park mitigation requirements. Park land must be dedicated or fees in lieu of dedication must be paid as set forth in this title. However, if an applicant provides recreation amenities in buffers as allowed under this chapter, the cost of those amenities may be subtracted from the total park mitigation calculated for a given project with prior approval of the Planning and Community Development Director. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.310 Demonstration of Denial of All Reasonable Economic Uses.

In order to conduct a regulated activity in a critical area where the applicant is claiming that denial of authorization of such an activity would deny all reasonable economic uses of the property, the applicant must demonstrate that such is the case. If a regulated activity is allowed within a critical area it must minimize impacts per the “requirements” sections, below. If the Planning and Community Development Director or designee determines that alteration of a critical area is necessary and unavoidable, written findings addressing each of the items listed in this section shall be placed in the official project file. Demonstration of denial of all reasonable economic uses shall be accomplished as follows:

(a)    An applicant must demonstrate that denial of the permit would impose an extraordinary hardship on the part of the applicant brought about by circumstances peculiar to the subject property.

(b)    For water-dependent activities, unavoidable and necessary impact can be demonstrated where there are no practicable alternatives which would not involve a wetland or fish and wildlife conservation area or which would not have less adverse impact on a wetland or fish and wildlife conservation area, and would not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.

(c)    Where non-water-dependent activities are proposed, it shall be presumed that adverse impacts are avoidable. This presumption may be rebutted upon a demonstration that:

(1)    The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished utilizing one or more other sites in the general region that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on regulated critical areas;

(2)    A reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project as proposed and all alternative designs of the project as proposed that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on a critical area or its buffer will not accomplish the basic purpose of the project; and

(3)    In cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the project as proposed due to constraints such as zoning, deficiencies of infrastructure, or parcel size, the applicant has made reasonable attempt to remove or accommodate such constraints. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 52, 2013; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.320 Allowance of Regulated Use in a Critical Area Where Denial of All Economic Use is Demonstrated.

If an applicant for an activity or development proposal demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning and Community Development Director or designee that application of these standards would deny all reasonable economic use of the property as provided by Section 14.88.220, development, as may be conditioned, shall be allowed if the applicant also demonstrates all of the following to the satisfaction of the Director:

(a)    If proposed in a wetland, stream, creek, river, lake or other surface water, that the proposed project is water-dependent or requires access to the wetland as a central element of its basic function; or

(b)    If proposed in a critical area not listed in subsection (a) of this section, that it is not water-dependent but has no practicable alternative; and

(c)    That no reasonable use with less impact on the critical area and its buffer is possible (e.g., agriculture, aquaculture, transfer or sale of development rights or credits, sale of open space easements, etc.);

(d)    That there is no feasible on-site alternative to the proposed activities, including reduction in density, phasing of project implementation, change in timing of activities, revision of road and lot layout, and/or related site planning considerations, that would allow a reasonable economic use with less adverse impacts to the critical area and its buffer;

(e)    That the proposed activities will result in minimum feasible alteration or impairment to the functional characteristics of the critical area and its existing contours, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, hydrological, and geologic conditions;

(f)    That disturbance of the critical area has been minimized by locating any necessary alteration in buffers to the extent possible;

(g)    That the proposed activities will not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered, threatened, or sensitive species as listed by the Federal Government or the State of Washington. An applicant is required to confirm with the State of Washington that special conditions or recommendations are not required for candidate or monitor species;

(h)    That the proposed activities will not cause significant degradation of groundwater or surface water quality;

(i)    That the proposed activities comply with all State, local and Federal laws, including those related to sediment control, pollution control, floodplain restrictions, and on-site wastewater disposal;

(j)    That any and all alterations to critical areas and their buffers will be adequately mitigated;

(k)    That there will be no damage to nearby public or private property and no threat to the health or safety of people on or off the property;

(l)    That the inability to derive reasonable economic use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant in segregating or dividing the property and creating the undevelopable condition after the effective date of this chapter; and

(m)    That deliberate measures have been taken to minimize the impacts. Minimizing impacts shall include but not be limited to:

(1)    Limiting the degree or magnitude of the prohibited activity;

(2)    Limiting the implementation of the prohibited activity;

(3)    Using appropriate and best available technology;

(4)    Taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

(5)    Sensitive site design and siting of facilities and construction staging areas away from critical areas and their buffers;

(6)    Involving resource agencies early in site planning;

(7)    Providing protective measures such as siltation curtains, hay bales and other siltation prevention measures; and

(8)    Scheduling the prohibited activity to avoid interference with wildlife and fisheries rearing, resting, nesting or spawning activities. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 53, 2013; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.330 Nonconforming Activities.

A regulated activity that was approved prior to the passage of this chapter and to which significant economic resources have been committed pursuant to such approval but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following:

(a)    No such activity shall be expanded, modified, or substituted in any way that increases the extent of its nonconformity without a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter;

(b)    Except for cases of discontinuance as part of normal agricultural practices, if a nonconforming activity is discontinued for 180 days, any resumption of the activity shall conform to this chapter;

(c)    If a nonconforming use or activity is destroyed by human activities or a natural occurrence, it shall not be resumed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter;

(d)    Activities or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming activities. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.340 Assessment Relief.

The Snohomish County Assessor’s office considers critical area regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped critical area who has dedicated an easement or entered into a perpetual conservation restriction with the City of Lake Stevens or a nonprofit organization to permanently control some or all regulated activities in that portion of land assessed consistent with these restrictions shall be considered for exemption from special assessments to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and water mains. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

Part IV.    Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas


14.88.400 Classification.

Fish and wildlife conservation areas include:

(a)    Lands containing priority habitats and species, including plant and/or animal species listed on Federal or State threatened or endangered species lists.

(b)    Naturally occurring ponds under 20 acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide fish or wildlife habitat. These do not include ponds deliberately designed and created from dry sites such as canals, detention facilities, waste-water treatment facilities, farm ponds, temporary construction ponds (of less than three years’ duration), and landscape amenities. However, naturally occurring ponds may include those artificial ponds intentionally created from dry areas in order to mitigate conversion of ponds, if permitted by a regulatory authority.

(c)    Waters of the State, as defined in WAC Title 222, Forest Practices Rules and Regulations. Waters of the State shall be classified using the system in WAC 222-16-030. In classifying waters of the State as fish and wildlife habitats the following shall be used:

(1)    Species are present which are endangered, threatened or sensitive;

(2)    Existing surrounding land uses are incompatible with salmonid and other game fish habitat;

(3)    Presence and size of riparian ecosystem;

(4)    Existing water rights.

(d)    Lakes, ponds, and streams planted with game fish (defined at RCW 77.08.020), including those planted under the auspices of Federal, State, local, or tribal programs, or which support priority fish species as identified by the Department of Fish and Wildlife.

(e)    State natural area preserves and natural resource conservation areas.

(f)    Habitats or species of local importance. Such habitats or species may be locally listed per the process elucidated in Section 14.88.415.

(g)    Streams shall be classified according to the stream type system as provided in WAC 222-16-030, Stream Classification System, as amended.

(1)    Type S Stream. Those streams, within their ordinary high water mark, as inventoried as shorelines of the State under Chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto.

(2)    Type F Stream. Those stream segments within the ordinary high water mark that are not Type S streams, and which are demonstrated or provisionally presumed to be used by fish. Stream segments which have a width of two feet or greater at the ordinary high water mark and have a gradient of 16 percent or less for basins less than or equal to 50 acres in size, or have a gradient of 20 percent or less for basins greater than 50 acres in size, are provisionally presumed to be used by fish. A provisional presumption of fish use may be refuted at the discretion of the Planning and Community Development Director where any of the following conditions are met:

(i)    It is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the stream segment in question is upstream of a complete, permanent, natural fish passage barrier, above which no stream section exhibits perennial flow;

(ii)    It is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the stream segment in question has confirmed, long-term, naturally occurring water quality parameters incapable of supporting fish;

(iii)    Sufficient information about a geomorphic region is available to support a departure from the characteristics described above for the presumption of fish use, as determined in consultation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, or others;

(iv)    The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife has issued a hydraulic project approval, pursuant to RCW 77.55.100, which includes a determination that the stream segment in question is not used by fish; and

(v)    No fish are discovered in the stream segment in question during a stream survey conducted according to the protocol provided in the Washington Forest Practices Board Manual, Section 13, Guidelines for Determining Fish Use for the Purpose of Typing waters under WAC 222-16-031; provided, that no unnatural fish passage barriers have been present downstream of said stream segment over a period of at least two years.

(3)    Type Np Stream. Those stream segments within the ordinary high water mark that are perennial and are not Type S or Type F streams. However, for the purpose of classification, Type Np streams include intermittent dry portions of the channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow. If the uppermost point of perennial flow cannot be identified with simple, nontechnical observations (see Washington Forest Practices Board Manual, Section 23), then said point shall be determined by a qualified professional selected or approved by the City.

(4)    Type Ns Stream. Those stream segments within the ordinary high water mark that are not Type S, Type F, or Type Np streams. These include seasonal streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall that are not located downstream from any Type Np stream segment. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 54, 2013; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.410 Determination of Boundary.

(a)    The boundaries of fish and wildlife conservation areas shall be determined by the Planning and Community Development Director or designee, who may rely on a Departmental approved biological resources survey prepared by a qualified wildlife biologist per the Department’s Biological Resources Survey Guidelines. Such a report would be supplied by the applicant of a permit.

(b)    The boundary of the creek, stream, river, lake, or other surface water shall be determined by the Planning and Community Development Director or designee, relying on a delineation by a licensed surveyor or other comparable expert. Such boundary shall be contiguous with the 100-year floodplain designations as adopted by the City, or where such a designation has not been adopted by the City, the 100-year floodplain designation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Flood Insurance Program where it has been delineated (shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)). Where this information does not exist, the boundary determination shall be made by a licensed surveyor and based upon the same criteria used by FEMA. This determination shall be confirmed by the City Engineer. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.415 Species/Habitats of Local Importance.

(a)    Species or habitats may be listed as a species or habitat of local importance by the City Council according to the following process:

(1)    An individual or organization must:

(i)    Demonstrate a need for special consideration based on:

a.    Declining populations;

b.    Sensitivity to habitat manipulation; or

c.    Commercial or game value or other special value, such as public appeal.

(ii)    Propose relevant management strategies considered effective and within the scope of this chapter.

(iii)    Provide species or habitat location(s) on a map.

(2)    Submitted proposals will be reviewed by the Planning and Community Development Director or designee and forwarded to the Departments of Fish and Wildlife and Natural Resources, and/or other local, State, Federal, or tribal agencies or experts for comment and recommendation regarding accuracy of data and effectiveness of proposed management strategies.

(3)    The City Council will hold a public hearing for proposals found to be complete, accurate, potentially effective, and within the scope of this chapter. Approved nominations will become designated a species or habitat of local importance and will be subject to the provisions of this chapter.

(b)    Species or habitats of local importance include:

(1)    [None adopted as of May 1, 1995] (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.420 Allowed Activities.

Except where regulated by other sections of this or any other title or law, the following uses shall be allowed within fish and wildlife conservation areas when the requirements of Section 14.88.430 have been met and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed:

(a)    Those activities listed in Section 14.88.220.

(b)    Activities consistent with the species located there and all applicable State and Federal regulations regarding the species, as determined by the Planning and Community Development Director or designee, who may consult with other resource agencies as to their recommendations.

(c)    Bridges and other crossings over streams for public and private rights-of-way. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.430 Requirements.

(a)    Except as provided in this subsection, a 50-foot buffer shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to fish and wildlife conservation areas. All buffers shall be measured from the fish and wildlife conservation area boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the buffer may be increased depending on the habitat value and the proposed land use.

(b)    Buffer widths may be increased based on recommendations by the Department of Fish and Wildlife based on their Management Recommendations for Priority Habitats and Species.

(c)    To retain the natural functions of streams and stream corridors, the following streamside buffers shall be maintained:

(1)    For ravines with banks greater than 10 feet in depth, maintain the existing or native vegetation within the ravine and a strip 25 feet from the top of the bank;

(2)    Where there is no ravine or the bank is less than 10 feet in depth, maintain existing or native vegetation on both sides of the stream as measured from the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), in accordance with Table 14.88-I, which sets forth the required buffer widths based on classification of stream types:

Table 14.88-I: Stream Buffer Width 

	Stream Type	Buffer

	S	150 feet

	F	100 feet

	Np	50 feet

	Ns	50 feet

(d)    Widths shall be measured outward in each direction, on the horizontal plane, from the ordinary high water mark, or from the top of the bank if the ordinary high water mark cannot be identified, or from the outer edge of the channel migration zone when present.

(e)    The Planning and Community Development Director may modify the buffer widths in the above table in accordance with the following:

(1)    Buffer widths may be increased as necessary to fully protect riparian functions. For example, the buffer may be extended to the outer edge of the floodplain or windward into an area of high tree blow-down potential as determined by an arborist.

(2)    Buffer widths may be reduced in exchange for restoration and enhancement of degraded areas in accordance with an approved plan, or for buffer averaging in accordance with Section 14.88.275 and subsection (e)(4) of this section.

(3)    If the stream enters an underground culvert or pipe, and is unlikely to ever be restored aboveground, the Planning and Community Development Director may waive the buffer along the undergrounded stream; provided, that where the stream enters and emerges from the pipe the opposite outer edges of the buffer shall be joined by a radius equal to the buffer width, with said radius projecting over the piped stream.

(4)    Stream buffer widths may be modified by averaging. In no instance shall the buffer width be reduced by more than 25 percent of the standard buffer. Stream buffer width averaging shall only be allowed when the applicant demonstrates the following:

(i)    A site-specific evaluation and documentation of buffer adequacy is based on consideration of the best available science as described in Section 14.88.235; and

(ii)    A buffer enhancement plan is proposed that would significantly improve the functions and values of the stream buffer(s); and

(iii)    The averaging will not impair or reduce the habitat, water quality purification and enhancement, stormwater detention, groundwater recharge, shoreline protection and erosion and other functions and values of the stream and buffer.

(5)    Buffer widths may be modified if the subject property is separated from the stream channel by preexisting, intervening, and lawfully created structures, public roads, or other substantial preexisting intervening improvements. The intervening structures, public roads, or other substantial improvements must separate the subject upland property from the stream channel by height or width, preventing or impairing the delivery of buffer functions to the steam channel. In such cases, the reduced buffer width shall reflect the buffer functions that can be delivered to the stream channel.

(f)    Development in the shorelines of State-wide significance is regulated under Appendix B of the City’s State-approved Shoreline Master Program (SMP).

(g)    To protect the natural functions and aesthetic qualities of a stream and stream buffer, a detailed temporary erosion control plan which identifies the specific mitigating measures to be implemented during construction to protect the water from erosion, siltation, landslides and hazardous construction materials shall be required. The City shall review the plan with the appropriate State, Federal and tribal agencies and any adjacent jurisdiction. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 898, Sec. 8, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.440 Mitigation.

In order to avoid significant environmental impacts, the applicant for a land use or development permit may consider performing the following actions, listed in order of preference. What is considered adequate mitigation will depend on the nature and magnitude of the potential impact as determined in accordance with Section 14.88.275.

(a)    Dedicate an exclusive open space easement for the protection of wildlife and/or habitat, creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, or other surface water over the creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, or other surface water and a buffer consistent with the standards listed in Section 14.88.430. Where such mitigation leads to or would in the opinion of the Planning and Community Development Director lead to a court finding of a taking, the below listed mitigation may be considered.

(b)    Where on-site protection is not possible, dedicate an exclusive easement for the protection of an equivalent (in type and value) waterway over the waterway and a 50-foot buffer on an off-site waterway at a 2:1 ratio. The location of any off-site waterway shall be located as near to the site as possible, in accordance with the following preferred order:

(1)    Contiguous to the impacted waterway;

(2)    Within the same drainage basin;

(3)    Elsewhere within the City;

(4)    Within the Lake Stevens UGA;

(5)    Within the region.

(c)    The applicant may propose innovative site design based on the best available science and pursuant to Section 14.88.298 if the innovative development design will achieve protection equivalent to or better than the standard provisions of this chapter. Approval of the innovative site design will be considered in combination with criteria listed in Section 14.88.298 if the design achieves the following:

(1)    The site design avoids all impacts to the critical area and minimizes buffer impacts; or

(2)    The site design increases the functions and/or values of the stream channel and buffer with a combination of the following measures:

(i)    Increasing canopy-cover shade in the riparian zone to maintain cool stream temperatures and regulate micro-climates in the stream-riparian corridor;

(ii)    Reducing fine sediment input in the stream system through hydrologic retention, filtration and stream bank protection;

(iii)    Stabilizing stream banks, and minimizing stream bank erosion;

(iv)    Filtering and reducing potential of impact pollutants from groundwater and surface water runoff;

(v)    Increasing large woody debris and coarse particulate matter into the stream channel for habitat and to moderate stream flow;

(vi)    Increasing critical wildlife habitat along stream-associated migration corridors;

(vii)    Increasing in-stream habitat for aquatic, amphibian, invertebrate and resident and/or anadromous fish species. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

Part V.    Frequently Flooded Areas


14.88.500 Classification.

Classification for flood zones shall be consistent with the regulatory floodplain designations as adopted by the City per Chapter 14.64, or where such a designation has not been adopted by the City, by the special flood hazard area designations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Flood Insurance Program. Any such designations adopted by the City shall consider the following criteria if and when designating and classifying these areas:

(a)    Flooding impact to human health, safety, and welfare and to public facilities and services; and

All land uses and development proposals shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Lake Stevens Municipal Code for general and specific flood hazard protection (see Chapter 11.06, Stormwater Management).

(a)    Development shall not reduce the effective flood storage volume. Reduction of the floodwater storage capacity due to grading, construction, or other regulated activities shall provide compensatory storage per Section 14.64.055(b).

(b)    The final recorded subdivision plat or site plan shall include a notice that the property contains land within the regulatory floodplain including special flood hazard areas and protected areas, as applicable. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 860, Sec. 5 (Exh. 3), 2011; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.540 Mitigation.

If potential flooding impacts from development cannot be avoided by design or if the use is not an allowed or exempt use, the applicant shall provide a habitat impact assessment and/or habitat mitigation plan to mitigate impacts on Federal, State or locally protected species and habitat, water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat, per Section 14.64.055(c) and (d). (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 860, Sec. 5 (Exh. 3), 2011; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

Part VI.    Geologically Hazardous Areas


14.88.600 Classification.

(a)    Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquakes, liquefaction, or other geological events. Geologically hazardous areas shall be classified based upon the history or existence of landslides, unstable soils, steep slopes, high erosion potential or seismic hazards. In determining the significance of a geologically hazardous area the following criteria shall be used:

(1)    Potential economic, health, and safety impact related to construction in the area;

(2)    Soil type, slope, vegetative cover, and climate of the area;

(3)    Available documentation of history of soil movement, the presence of mass wastage, debris flow, rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion or undercutting by wave action, or the presence of an alluvial fan which may be subject to inundation, debris flows, or deposition of stream-transported sediments.

(b)    The different types of geologically hazardous areas are defined as follows:

(1)    Erosion hazard areas are as defined by the USDA Soil Conservation Service, United States Geologic Survey, or by the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas. The following classes are high erosion hazard areas:

(i)    Class 3, class U (unstable) includes severe erosion hazards and rapid surface runoff areas;

(ii)    Class 4, class UOS (unstable old slides) includes areas having severe limitations due to slope; and

(iii)    Class 5, class URS (unstable recent slides).

(2)    Landslide hazard areas shall include areas subject to severe risk of landslide based on a combination of geologic, topographic and hydrologic factors. Some of these areas may be identified in the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas, or through site-specific criteria. Landslide hazard areas include the following:

(i)    Areas characterized by slopes greater than 15 percent; and impermeable soils (typically silt and clay) frequently interbedded with permeable granular soils (predominantly sand and gravel) or impermeable soils overlain with permeable soils; and springs or groundwater seepage;

(ii)    Any area which has exhibited movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to present) or which is underlain by mass wastage debris of that epoch;

(iii)    Any area potentially unstable due to rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion or undercutting by wave action;

(iv)    Any area located on an alluvial fan presently subject to or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or deposition of stream-transported sediments;

(v)    Any area with a slope of 40 percent or greater and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock;

(vi)    Any area with slope defined by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service as having a severe limitation for building site development; and

(vii)    Any shoreline designated or mapped as class U, UOS, or URS by the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas.

(3)    Slopes.

(i)    Moderate slopes shall include any slope greater than or equal to 15 percent and less than 40 percent.

(ii)    Steep slopes shall include any slope greater than or equal to 40 percent.

(4)    Seismic hazard areas shall include areas subject to severe risk of earthquake damage as a result of seismic induced settlement, shaking, slope failure or soil liquefaction. These conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless soils of low density usually in association with a shallow groundwater table. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.610 Determination of Boundary.

Determination of a boundary of a geologically hazardous area shall be made by the Planning and Community Development Director, relying on a geotechnical or similar technical report and other information where available and pertinent. Such reports or information shall be provided by an applicant for an activity or permit at the request of the City. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.620 Allowed Activities.

Except where regulated by other sections of this or any other title or law, the following uses shall be allowed within geologically hazardous areas when the requirements of Section 14.88.630 have been met and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed:

(a)    Those activities allowed per Section 14.88.220.

(b)    Any other use allowed per the zone; provided, that it meets the requirements of Section 14.88.630 and will not have a detrimental impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or will not negatively impact neighboring properties. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.630 Geological Assessment Requirements.

Development proposals on or within 200 feet of any areas which are designated as geologically hazardous, or which the City has reason to believe are geologically hazardous based on site-specific field investigation, shall be required to submit a geological assessment.

(a)    The geological assessment shall be submitted with the minimum required content as set forth in subsection (d) of this section and in the format established by the Planning and Community Development Director, and shall be consistent with the following:

(1)    A geotechnical letter is required when the geologist or geotechnical engineer finds that no active geological hazard area exists on or within 200 feet of the site.

(2)    A geotechnical report is required when the geologist or geotechnical engineer finds that an active geological hazard area exists on or within 200 feet of the proposed project area.

(b)    The Department shall review the geological assessment and either accept or reject the assessment and require revisions or additional information. When the geological assessment has been accepted, the Department shall issue a decision on the land use permit application.

(c)    A geological assessment for a specific site may be valid for a period of up to five years when the proposed land use activity and site conditions affecting the site are unchanged. However, if any surface and subsurface conditions associated with the site change during the five-year period or if there is new information about a geological hazard, the applicant may be required to submit an amendment to the geological assessment.

(d)    A geological assessment shall include the following minimum information and analysis:

(1)    A field investigation that may include the use of historical air photo analysis, review of public records and documentation, and interviews with adjacent property owners or others knowledgeable about the area, etc.

(2)    An evaluation of any areas on the site or within 200 feet of the site that are geologically hazardous as set forth in Section 14.88.600.

(3)    An analysis of the potential impacts of the proposed development activity on any potential geological hazard that could result from the proposed development either on site or off site. For landslide hazard areas, the analysis shall consider the run-out hazard of landslide debris to the proposed development that starts upslope whether the slope is part of the subject property or starts off site.

(4)    Identification of any mitigation measures required to eliminate potentially significant geological hazards both on the proposed development site and any potentially impacted off-site properties. When hazard mitigation is required, the mitigation plan shall specifically address how the proposed activity maintains or reduces the preexisting level of risk to the site and adjacent properties on a long term basis. The mitigation plan shall include recommendations regarding any long term maintenance activities that may be required to mitigate potential hazards.

(5)    The geological assessment shall document the field investigations, published data and references, data and conclusions from past geological assessments, or geotechnical investigations of the site, site-specific measurements, tests, investigations, or studies, as well as the methods of data analysis and calculations that support the results, conclusions, and recommendations.

(6)    The geological assessment shall contain a summary of any other information the geologist identifies as relevant to the assessment and mitigation of geological hazards.

(e)    Geological assessments shall be prepared under the responsible charge of a geologist or geotechnical engineer, and shall be signed, sealed, and dated by the geologist or geotechnical engineer. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.640 Setback Buffer Requirements.

(a)    The setback buffer width shall be based upon information contained in a geological assessment, and shall be measured on a horizontal plane from a vertical line established at the edge of the geologically hazardous area limits (both from the top and toe of slope). In the event that a specific setback buffer is not included in the recommendation of the geological assessment, the setback buffer shall be based upon the standards contained in Chapter 18 of the International Building Code (IBC), or as the IBC is updated and amended.

(1)    If the geological assessment recommends setback buffers that are less than the standard buffers that would result from application of Chapter 18 of the IBC, the specific rationale and basis for the reduced buffers shall be clearly articulated in the geological assessment.

(2)    The City may require increased setback buffer widths under any of the following circumstances:

(i)    The land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse impacts.

(ii)    The area has a severe risk of slope failure or downslope stormwater drainage impacts.

(iii)    The increased buffer is necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare based upon findings and recommendations of geological assessment.

(b)    Unless otherwise permitted as part of an approved alteration, the setback buffers required by this section shall be maintained in native vegetation to provide additional soil stability and erosion control. If the buffer area has been cleared, it shall be replanted with native vegetation in conjunction with any proposed development activity.

(c)    The City may impose seasonal restrictions on clearing and grading within 200 feet of any geologically hazardous areas. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.650 Allowed Alterations.

Unless associated with another critical area, the Planning and Community Development Director or designee may allow alterations of an area identified as a geologically hazardous area or the setback buffers specified in the IBC if an approved geotechnical report demonstrates that:

(a)    The proposed development will not create a hazard to the subject property, surrounding properties or rights-of-way, or erosion or sedimentation to off-site properties or bodies of water;

(b)    The proposal addresses the existing geological constraints of the site, including an assessment of soils and hydrology;

(c)    The proposed method of construction will reduce erosion potential, landslide and seismic hazard potential, and will improve or not adversely affect the stability of slopes;

(d)    The proposal uses construction techniques which minimize disruption of existing topography and natural vegetation;

(e)    The proposal is consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter and mitigates any permitted impacts to critical areas in the vicinity of the proposal;

(f)    The proposal mitigates all impacts identified in the geotechnical letter or geotechnical report;

(g)    All utilities and access roads or driveways to and within the site are located so as to require the minimum amount of modification to slopes, vegetation or geologically hazardous areas; and

(h)    The improvements are certified as safe as designed and under anticipated conditions by a geologist or geotechnical engineer. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.660 Prohibited Alterations.

Modification of geologically hazardous areas shall be prohibited under the following circumstances:

(a)    Where geologically hazardous slopes are located in a stream, wetland, and/or a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or their required buffers, alterations of the slopes are not permitted, except as allowed in Section 14.88.220. The required buffer for such slopes shall be determined through the site-specific geological assessment, but in no case shall be less than 25 feet from the top of slopes of 25 percent and greater.

(b)    Any proposed alteration that would result in the creation of or which would increase or exacerbate existing geological hazards, or which would result in substantial unmitigated geological hazards either on or off site shall be prohibited. 

(c)    No new development or creation of new lots is allowed that would cause foreseeable risk from geological conditions to people or improvements during the life of the development (WAC 173-26-221(2)(c)(ii)(B)).

(d)    No new development is allowed that would require structural shoreline stabilization over the life of the development. Exceptions may be made for the limited instances where stabilization is necessary to protect allowed uses where no alternative locations are available and no net loss of ecological functions will result. (WAC 173-26-221(2)(c)(ii)(C)). (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.670 Mitigation.

(a)    In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, as part of any approval of development on or adjacent to geologically hazardous areas or within the setback buffers required by this section:

(1)    The City shall require:

(i)    Geologically hazardous areas not approved for alteration and their setback buffers shall be placed in a native growth protection area as set forth in Section 14.88.290.

(ii)    Any geologically hazardous area or required setback buffer that is allowed to be altered subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a covenant of notification and indemnification/hold harmless agreement in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Such document shall identify any limitation placed on the approved alterations.

(2)    The City may require:

(i)    The presence of a geologist on the site to supervise during clearing, grading, filling, and construction activities which may affect geologically hazardous areas, and provide the City with certification that the construction is in compliance with the geologist’s or geotechnical engineer’s recommendations and has met approval of the geologist or geotechnical engineer, and other relevant information concerning the geologically hazardous conditions of the site.

(ii)    Vegetation and other soil stabilizing structures or materials be retained or provided.

(iii)    Long term maintenance of slopes and on-site drainage systems.

(b)    If potential geologic impacts cannot be avoided by adhering to the above requirements and the other requirements of this chapter, other forms of mitigation may be considered. Applicants must provide mitigation plans exploring and analyzing any proposed mitigation measures. What is considered adequate mitigation will depend on the nature and magnitude of the potential impact. For example, some potential risk due to construction in geologically hazardous areas may be reduced through structural engineering design. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

Part VIII.    Wetlands


14.88.800 Purpose.

The purposes of this chapter are to: 

(a)    Recognize and protect the beneficial functions performed by wetlands, which include, but are not limited to, providing food, breeding, nesting and/or rearing habitat for fish and wildlife; recharging and discharging groundwater; contributing to stream flow during low flow periods; stabilizing stream banks and shorelines; storing storm and flood waters to reduce flooding and erosion; and improving water quality through biofiltration, adsorption, and retention and transformation of sediments, nutrients, and toxicants. 

(b)    Regulate land use to avoid adverse effects on wetlands and maintain the functions and values of wetlands throughout Lake Stevens. 

(c)    Establish review procedures for development proposals in and adjacent to wetlands. 

(d)    Compliance with the provisions of the chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, State, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, Shoreline Substantial Development Permits, HPA permits, Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits, NPDES permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this chapter. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 855, Sec. 24, 2011; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.805 Identification and Rating.

(a)    Identification and Delineation. Wetlands, buffers and their boundaries shall be identified and delineated in accordance with the approved Federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplement. All areas within the City meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Wetland delineations are valid for five years; after such date, the City shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary. Sources used to identify designated wetlands include, but are not limited to:

(1)    United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory.

(2)    Areas identified as hydric soils, soils with significant soil inclusions and wet spots with the United States Department of Agriculture/Soil Conservation Service Soil Survey for Snohomish County.

(3)    Washington State Department of Natural Resources, Geographic Information System, Hydrography and Soils Survey Layers.

(4)    City of Lake Stevens Critical Areas Inventory Maps.

(b)    Rating. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington Department of Ecology wetland rating system, as set forth in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology) and in accordance with WAC 173-22-035, which contains the definitions and methods for determining whether the criteria below are met. 

(1)    Category I. Category I wetlands represent unique or rare wetland types; are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or provide a high level of functions. In Lake Stevens Category I wetlands may include: 

(i)    Wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR;

(ii)    Bogs; 

(iii)    Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre; and 

(iv)    Wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more). 

(2)    Category II. In Lake Stevens Category II wetlands may include wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points) that are difficult though not impossible to replace and provide high levels of some functions.

(3)    Category III. In Lake Stevens Category III wetlands may include: 

(i)    Wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); 

(ii)    Can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project; and

(iii)    Wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. 

(4)    Category IV. In Lake Stevens Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scoring fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that functions may be replaced, or in some cases improved. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree.

(c)    Illegal Modifications. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications made by the applicant or with the applicant’s knowledge. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019)


14.88.810 Determination of Boundary.

(a)    The Planning and Community Development Director or designee, relying on a field investigation supplied by an applicant and applying the wetland definition provided in this chapter, shall determine the location of the wetland boundary. Qualified professional and technical scientists shall perform wetland delineations as part of a wetland identification report in accordance with WAC 173-22-035. Criteria to be included in a required wetland identification report may be found in Section 14.88.275, Mitigation/Enhancement Plan Requirements. The applicant is required to show the location of the wetland boundary on a scaled drawing as a part of the permit application.

(b)    When the applicant has provided a delineation of the wetland boundary, the Planning and Community Development Director or designee shall verify the accuracy of, and may render adjustments to, the boundary delineation. In the event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the applicant, the Planning and Community Development Director shall, at the applicant’s expense, obtain expert services to render a final delineation.

(c)    The Planning and Community Development Director, when requested by the applicant, may waive the delineation of boundary requirement for the applicant and, in lieu of delineation by the applicant, perform the delineation. The Planning and Community Development Director or designee shall consult with qualified professional scientists and technical experts or other experts as needed to perform the delineation. The applicant will be charged for the costs incurred. Where the City performs a wetland delineation at the request of the applicant, such delineation shall be considered a final determination. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 855, Sec. 25, 2011; Ord. 797, Sec. 6, 2009; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.820 Allowed Activities.

Except where regulated by other sections of this or any other title or law, and provided they are conducted using best management practices, the following uses and activities shall be allowed and regulated within wetlands and their buffers when the requirements of Sections 14.88.830 and 14.88.840 have been met and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed:

(a)    Those uses listed in Section 14.88.220.

(b)    Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and/or other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing wetland. 

(c)    Stormwater management facilities. A wetland or its buffer can be physically or hydrologically altered to meet the requirements of an LID, runoff treatment or flow control BMP if the following criteria are met: 

(1)    The location of the stormwater management facility is restricted to the outer 25 percent of the buffer around the wetland; 

(2)    There will be “no net loss” of functions and values of the wetland; 

(3)    The wetland does not contain a breeding population of any native amphibian species;

(4)    The hydrologic functions of the wetland can be improved;

(5)    The wetland lies in the natural routing of the runoff, and the discharge follows the natural routing; 

(6)    All regulations regarding stormwater and wetland management are followed, including but not limited to local and State wetland and stormwater codes, manuals, and permits; 

(7)    Modifications that alter the structure of a wetland or its soils will require permits. Existing functions and values that are lost would have to be compensated/replaced.

(8)    Stormwater LID BMPs required as part of new and redevelopment projects can be considered within wetlands and their buffers. However, these areas may contain features that render LID BMPs infeasible. A site-specific characterization is required to determine if an LID BMP is feasible at the project site. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.825 Exemptions.

The following wetlands may be exempt from the requirement to avoid impacts and they may be filled if the impacts are fully mitigated based on the remaining actions, pursuant to State and Federal requirements. If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of credits from an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank, consistent with the terms and conditions of the program or bank.

(a)    All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet: 

(1)    Not associated with riparian areas or their buffers; 

(2)    Not associated with shorelines of the State or their associated buffers; 

(3)    Not part of a wetland mosaic; 

(4)    Do not score six or more points for habitat function based on the 2014 update to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology); and

(5)    Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain Federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species of local importance. 

(b)    Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain Federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this chapter. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019)


14.88.830 Requirements.

(a)    Buffers. Wetland buffers shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to regulated wetlands as provided in Table 14.88-II, unless modified elsewhere in this chapter.

(1)    Any wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer zone shall be determined according to wetland category and the proposed land use. 

(2)    To facilitate long-range planning using a landscape approach, the Planning and Community Development Director or designee may pre-assess wetlands using the rating system and establish appropriate wetland buffer widths for such wetlands. The Administrator will prepare maps of wetlands that have been pre-assessed in this manner. 

(3)     All buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. Buffers must be fully vegetated in order to be included in buffer area calculations. Lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas will not be considered buffers or included in buffer area calculations.

(b)    The buffer widths in Table 14.88-II assume that the standard buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should be planted to create the appropriate plant community, or the nonmitigated buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

Table 14.88-II Wetland Buffer Requirements  

	 	 	Buffer width in feet based on habitat scores

	Wetland Category	Buffer Condition*	3 – 5	6 – 7	8 – 9

	Category I	Standard	75	110	225

	No Mitigation	100	150	300

	Category I (High Value)	Standard	190	225

	No Mitigation	250	300

	Category II	Standard	75	110	225

	No Mitigation	100	150	300

	Category III	Standard	60	110	225

	No Mitigation	80	150	300

	Category IV	Standard	40

	No Mitigation	50

*    The buffer condition directly affects the required buffer width. A standard buffer width is to be used when the buffer is vegetated or will be planted to comply with Section 14.88.830(b) and Table 14.88-III; otherwise, the buffer is considered to have no mitigation and an increased buffer is required when limited vegetation exists or no mitigation is proposed to enhance buffer functions.

Table 14.88-III Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands (measures are required if applicable to a specific proposal)  

	Disturbance	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	•	Direct lights away from wetland

	Noise	•	Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

	•	If warranted, enhance existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source

	•	For activities that generate relatively continuous, potentially disruptive noise, such as certain heavy industry or mining, establish an additional 10-foot heavily vegetated buffer strip immediately adjacent to the outer wetland buffer

	Toxic runoff	•	Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

	•	Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 feet of wetland

	•	Apply integrated pest management

	Stormwater runoff	•	Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

	•	Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer

	•	Use low intensity development techniques (for more information refer to the drainage ordinance and manual)

	Change in water regime	•	Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance	•	Use privacy fencing or plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion

	•	Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement

	Dust	•	Use best management practices to control dust

(c)    Increased Wetland Buffer Widths. The Planning and Community Development Director shall require increased standard buffer zone widths on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values based on local conditions. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the regulated wetland. Such determination shall be attached as a permit condition and shall demonstrate that:

(1)    The wetland is used by a State or Federally listed plant or animal species or has essential or outstanding habitat for those species, or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or 

(2)    The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion, and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or 

(3)    The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than 30 percent.

(d)    Wetland Buffer Averaging. Wetland buffer widths may be modified by averaging. In no instance shall the buffer width be reduced by more than 25 percent of the standard buffer. Wetland buffer width averaging shall be allowed only where the applicant demonstrates all of the following as demonstrated in accordance with an approved critical areas report:

(1)    The averaging will not impair or reduce the habitat, water quality purification and enhancement, stormwater detention, groundwater recharge, shoreline protection, erosion protection, and other functions and values of the wetland and buffer;

(2)    The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher functioning area and decreased adjacent to lower functioning area; and

(3)    The total area contained within the wetland buffer after averaging is no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging.

(e)    Buffer Conditions. Except as otherwise specified, wetland buffers shall be retained in their natural condition. 

(1)    Where buffer disturbance may or has occurred during construction, revegetation with native wetland vegetation may be required appropriate for the ecoregion or with vegetation performing similar functions. 

(2)    If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

(f)    Buffer Reductions. Buffer reductions may be allowed for Category III or IV wetlands, provided the applicant demonstrates the proposal meets the criteria in subsections (f)(1) through (4) of this section and either subsection (f)(5) or (6) of this section. Buffer width reduction proposals that meet the criteria as determined by the Planning and Community Development Director or designee shall be reduced by no more than 25 percent of the required buffer.

(1)    The buffer area meets buffer area planting requirements in Section 14.88.275 and has less than 15 percent slopes; and

(2)    A site-specific evaluation and documentation of buffer adequacy is based on consideration of the best available science as described in Section 14.88.235; and

(3)    Buffer width averaging as outlined in subsection (d) of this section is not being used; and

(4)    A buffer enhancement plan is proposed that would significantly improve the function and value of a degraded wetland and buffer, specifically the required buffer enhancement plan should improve the ability of a degraded buffer to protect the water quality and hydrologic functions even if the width of the buffer is reduced, subject to mitigation requirements of Section 14.88.840; and either

(5)    The subject property is separated from the wetland by preexisting, intervening, and lawfully created structures, public roads, or other substantial improvements. The preexisting improvements must be found to separate the subject upland property from the wetland by height or width that prevents or impairs the delivery of buffer functions to the wetland. In such cases, the reduced buffer width shall reflect the buffer functions that can be delivered to the wetland; or

(6)    The wetland scores five or less points for wildlife habitat in accordance with the rating system applied in Section 14.88.800, and mitigation is provided based on Section 14.88.840(b) and Table 14.88-III, when determined appropriate based on the evaluation criteria in Sections 14.88.275 and 14.88.276.

(g)    Buffers may be modified when approved for the purpose of implementing innovative development design in accordance with Section 14.88.298. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.840 Mitigation.

The mitigation sequence set forth in this section should be applied after impact avoidance and minimization measures have been taken.

(a)    Location and Timing of Mitigation.

(1)    Restoration, creation, or enhancement actions should be undertaken on or adjacent to the site, or, where restoration, creation, or enhancement of a former wetland is proposed, within the same watershed. In-kind replacement of the impacted wetland is preferred for creation, restoration, or enhancement actions. The City may accept or recommend restoration, creation, or enhancement which is off site and/or out-of-kind, if the applicant can demonstrate that on-site or in-kind restoration, creation, or enhancement is unfeasible due to constraints such as parcel size or wetland type, or that a wetland of a different type or location is justified based on regional needs or functions;

(2)    Whether occurring on site or off site, the mitigation project shall occur near an adequate water supply with a hydrologic connection to the wetland to ensure a successful wetlands development or restoration;

(3)    Any approved proposal shall be completed before initiation of other permitted activities, unless a phased or concurrent schedule has also been approved by the Planning and Community Development Department;

(4)    Wetland acreage replacement ratios shall be as specified in Table 14.88-IV;

(5)    Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands.

(i)    This provision may be used when:

a.    The bank is certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC;

b.    The Planning and Community Development Director or designee determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

c.    The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.

(ii)    Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

(iii)    Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, the service area of the bank may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions.

(b)    Mitigation Performance Standards.

(1)    All reasonable measures shall be taken to avoid and reduce impacts. When such avoidance and reduction is not reasonable, adverse impacts to wetland functions and values shall be mitigated. Mitigation actions shall be implemented in the preferred sequence identified in Section 14.88.010(a). Proposals which include less preferred or compensatory mitigation shall demonstrate that:

(i)    All reasonable measures will be taken to reduce impacts and losses to the original wetland;

(ii)    No overall net loss will occur in wetland functions, values and acreage; and

(iii)    The restored, created or enhanced wetland will be as persistent and sustainable as the wetland it replaces.

(c)    Wetland Replacement Ratios.

(1)    Where wetland alterations are permitted by this chapter, the applicant shall restore or create equivalent areas of wetlands in order to compensate for wetland losses. Equivalent areas shall be determined according to size, function, category, location, timing factors, and projected success of restoration or creation.

(2)    Where wetland creation is proposed, all required buffers for the creation site shall be located on the proposed creation site. Properties adjacent to or abutting wetland creation projects shall not be responsible for providing any additional buffer requirements.

(3)    The following acreage replacement ratios shall be used as targets. The Planning and Community Development Director may vary these standards if the applicant can demonstrate and the Planning and Community Development Director or designee agrees that the variation will provide adequate compensation for lost wetland area, functions and values, or if other circumstances as determined by the Planning and Community Development Department justify the variation.

(4)    The qualified scientific professional in the wetlands report may, where feasible, recommend that restored or created wetlands shall be a higher wetland category than the altered wetland.

(d)    The Planning and Community Development Director may increase the ratios under the following circumstances:

(1)    Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation; or

(2)    A significant period of time will elapse between impact and replication of wetland functions.

(e)    All wetland restoration, creation and/or enhancement projects required pursuant to this chapter either as a permit condition or as the result of an enforcement action shall follow a mitigation plan prepared in conformance to the requirements of Section 14.88.275, Mitigation/Enhancement Plan Requirements.

(f)    Mitigation ratios for the replacement of impacted wetlands shall be as listed in Table 14.88-IV. However, Table 14.88-IV shall not apply to bogs, because it is not possible to create or restore bogs due to their unique chemistry and hydrology. Therefore, impacts to bogs are considered to be a loss of functions and shall be avoided.

Table 14.88-IV: Wetland Mitigation Ratios 

	Affected Wetland	Mitigation Type and Ratio

	Category	Re-establishment or Wetland Creation	Rehabilitation	Enhancement Only

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category I – Forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I – Score Based	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category I – Bog	Not considered possible	N/A	N/A

(g)    Buffer Mitigation Ratios. Impacts to buffers shall be mitigated at a minimum 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development. 

(h)    The applicant may propose innovative site design based on the best available science and pursuant to Section 14.88.298 if the innovative development design will achieve protection equivalent to or better than the standard provisions of this chapter. Approval of the innovative site design will be considered in combination with criteria listed in Section 14.88.298 if the design achieves the following:

(1)    The site design avoids impacts to the critical area; or

(2)    The site design increases the functions and/or values of the wetland and buffer with a combination of the following measures:

(i)    Improving water quality functions and values of the wetland and buffer by reducing fine sediment and pollutant input in the watershed by increasing hydrologic retention and filtration;

(ii)    Improving the hydrologic functions and values of the wetland and buffer by providing increased flood control adjacent to a stream channel or by improving water storage ability in the wetland system to increase groundwater recharge potential; and

(iii)    Increasing habitat for aquatic, amphibian and invertebrate species and associated wetland bird and mammal species.

(i)    Credit/Debit Method. As an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a-b, Olympia, WA, March 2006), the Director or designee may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report, (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised). (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 811, Sec. 92, 2010; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

Part IX.    Transfer of Development Rights


14.88.900 Definitions.

(a)    “Development rights” are those rights granted to a property owner under a particular zoning district.

(b)    “Transferable rights” include dwelling unit equivalents (density) and commercial/industrial square footage. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.910 Intent and General Regulations of Transferring Development Rights (TDR).

(a)    The purpose in allowing the transfer of density is:

(1)    To allow for the transfer of development rights out of critical areas into buildable areas; and

(2)    To allow a property owner to recover a portion of the development value from property that may be used for a public purpose.

(b)    TDR is not a guarantee that full development value can be recovered from a parcel of land designated as a sending area. Certain market forces may limit demand for density transfers including limitations placed on critical area receiving district capacities; particularly where all such districts are built out. Value of development rights shall be determined by the market for said rights and shall in no way be the responsibility of the City of Lake Stevens.

(c)    All transfers must be consistent with the policies of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and the provisions of this chapter. In particular, land developed within a critical area receiving district through the transfer of development rights shall comply with all use, dimensional, parking, screening, etc., requirements as set forth in this title.

(d)    Development rights may be transferred out of areas designated as critical area sending districts and only into areas designated as critical area receiving districts. They may be transferred within or across ownership boundaries.

(e)    When development rights are transferred off site, the property owners shall provide and enter into a contract with one another which, at a minimum, shall acknowledge their participation and acceptance. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.920 Qualifications for Designation of Land as a Critical Area Sending or Receiving District.

(a)    All areas classified as a critical area by this chapter shall be considered critical area sending districts. Additionally, land that does not qualify as a critical area but which has been determined by City Council to be land suitable for a public purpose may be designated as critical area sending districts by the Planning and Community Development Director with the concurrence of the majority ownership of the land.

(b)    Any parcel or portion of a parcel on which development can occur per this title may be designated as a critical area receiving district by the Planning and Community Development Director with the concurrence of the majority ownership of the land. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.930 Designation Process.

(a)    Critical area sending or receiving districts are considered overlay zones allowed per Section 14.88.920, Qualifications for Designation of Land as a Critical Area Sending or Receiving District. Designation as a critical area sending or receiving district is the equivalent of a rezone and shall be accomplished by the same process as specified in Section 14.16C.090.

(b)    Underlying land use and zoning designations may be changed by the legislative authority granted to the City through its normal Comprehensive Plan amendment or rezoning procedures. However, the land will retain the critical area sending district designation until that designation is specifically removed.

(c)    Land designated as a critical area sending or receiving district shall be shown as an overlay district on the Official Zoning Map. The map shall be modified upon each designation or revocation.

(d)    Designation or revocation as a critical area sending or receiving district shall be recorded with the Snohomish County Recorder’s Office and shall run with the land. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 903, Sec. 55, 2013; Ord. 811, Sec. 74, 2010; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.940 Designation Revocation.

(a)    Land that has been designated as a critical area sending district shall retain its designation:

(1)    Until all development rights calculated for that parcel have been transferred; or

(2)    For a period of three years, whereby the designation may be reviewed for reconsideration. The designation may be continued upon all of the following findings being met:

(i)    The property retains the same characteristics that qualified it as a critical area receiving district in the first place.

(ii)    The owner(s) of the property desire a continuation of the designation.

(iii)    It is still in the public interest to continue the designation.

(b)    Land that has been designated a critical area receiving district shall retain its designation until the property has yielded its development potential.

(c)    The Council may reconsider designation revocation of a noncritical area when it determines that the property is no longer suitable for public use.

(d)    Revocation of a critical area sending or receiving district designation shall not affect the underlying land use designation or zone. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)


14.88.950 Calculating Transferable Development Rights.

(a)    Maximum transferable development rights shall be calculated for each parcel or portion of a parcel by calculating the theoretical development capacity were the land not classified as a critical area. Theoretical development capacity is calculated based on the requirements of this title, in particular Chapter 14.48, Density and Dimensional Regulations, but also taking into account the requirements of all other chapters (e.g., parking, screening, fire code, building code, etc.).

(b)    Only like development rights may be transferred, and may only be transferred to a zone allowing a similar use, e.g., commercial square footage may be transferred out of a commercial district and into another commercial district or an industrial district that allows commercial uses. (Ord. 984 Sec. 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 773, Sec. 2, 2008; Ord. 741, Sec. 2, 2007)

14.100.010 Purposes.

The purposes of this chapter are:

(1)    To ensure that adequate school facilities are available to serve new growth and development; and

(2)    To require that new growth and development pay a proportionate share of the costs of new school facilities needed to serve new growth and development.


14.100.020 Applicability.

The terms of this chapter shall apply to all development which increases the number of dwelling units and for which a complete application for approval is submitted on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, except for development that was the subject of a prior SEPA threshold determination that provided for school mitigation.


14.100.030 Definitions.

Average assessed value means the district’s average assessed value for each dwelling unit type.

Boeckh Index means the current construction trade index of construction costs for each school type.

Capital facilities means school facilities identified in the school district’s capital facilities plan and are “system improvements” as defined by the GMA as opposed to localized “project improvements.”

Development means construction of new single-family and multifamily residential dwellings, including residential subdivisions, short platsbinding site plans, mobile home parks, condominiums and building permits.

Development activity means any residential construction or expansion of a building, structure or use of land, or any other change in use of a building, structure, or land that creates additional demand and need for school facilities, but excluding building permits for remodeling or renovation permits which do not result in additional dwelling units. Also excluded from this definition is “housing for older persons” as defined by 46 U.S.C. Section 3607, when guaranteed by a restrictive covenant, and new single-family detached units constructed on legal lots created prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

District property tax levy rate means the school district’s current capital property tax rate per $1,000 of assessed value.

Encumbered means school impact fees identified by the school district to be committed as part of the funding for capital facilities for which the publicly funded share has been assured, development approvals have been sought or construction contracts have been let.

Estimated facility construction cost means the planned costs of new schools or the actual construction costs of schools of the same grade span recently constructed by the district, including on site and off-site improvement costs. If the district does not have this cost information available, construction costs of school facilities of the same or similar grade span within another district are acceptable.

Facility design capacity means the number of students each school type is designed to accommodate, based on the district’s standard of service as determined by the district.

Grade span means a category into which a district groups its grades of students (e.g., elementary, middle or junior high, and high school).

Interest rate means the current interest rate as stated in the Bond Buyer Twenty Bond General Obligation Bond Index.

Land cost per acre means the estimated average land acquisition cost per acre (in current dollars) based on recent site acquisition costs, comparisons of comparable site acquisition costs in other districts, or the average assessed value per acre of properties comparable to school sites located within the district.

Permanent facilities means school facilities of the district with a fixed foundation.

Relocatable facilities means factory-built structures, transportable in one or more sections, that are designed to be used as education spaces and are needed to prevent the overbuilding of school facilities, to meet the needs of service areas within a district, or to cover the gap between the time that families move into new residential developments and the date that construction is completed on permanent school facilities.

Relocatable facilities cost means the total cost, based on actual costs incurred by the district, for purchasing and installing portable classrooms.

Relocatable facilities student capacity means the rated capacity for a typical portable classroom used for a specified grade span.

School impact fee means a payment of money imposed upon development as a condition of development approval to pay for school facilities needed to serve new growth and development. The school impact fee does not include a reasonable permit fee, an application fee, the administrative fee for collecting and handling impact fees, or the cost of reviewing independent fee calculations.

Standard of service means the standard adopted by each district which identifies the program year, the class size by grade span and taking into account the requirements of students with special needs, the number of classrooms, the types of facilities the district believes will best serve its student population, and other factors as identified in the district’s capital facilities plan. The district’s standard of service shall not be adjusted for any portion of the classrooms housed in relocatable facilities which are used as transitional facilities or from any specialized facilities housed in relocatable facilities.

State match percentage means the proportion of funds that are provided to the district for specific capital projects from the State’s common school construction fund. These funds are disbursed based on a formula which calculates district assessed valuation per pupil relative to the whole state assessed valuation per pupil to establish the maximum percentage of the total project eligible to be paid by the state.

Student factor (student generation rate) means the number of students of each grade span (elementary, middle/junior high, high school) that a district determines are typically generated by different dwelling unit types within the district. Each school district will use a survey or statistically valid methodology to derive the specific student generation rate; provided, that the survey or methodology is approved by the Lake Stevens City Council as part of the adopted capital facilities plan for each school district.


14.100.040 Capital facilities plan required.

The Lake Stevens School District shall be eligible to receive school impact fees upon approval, by the City Council, of a district capital facilities plan (SDCFP) which meets the requirements of the GMA. Approval of the SDCFP will also constitute adoption the schedule of school impact fees contained therein.


14.100.050 Expiration of district plans.

For purposes of school impact fee eligibility, the district’s capital facilities plan shall expire two years from the date of its adoption by the Council, or when an updated plan meeting the requirements of the GMA is adopted by the Council, whichever date first occurs.


14.100.060 Updating of district plans.

(a)    The district’s capital facilities plan shall be updated by the district and transmitted to the City at least 60 days prior to its biennial expiration date. The updated plan shall be submitted by the Planning Director to the Council for its consideration within 45 days of receipt. In the event the district desires to amend its capital facilities plan prior to the biennial expiration date, they may propose an amendment to be considered by the City, provided such amendments shall be made no more than once per year unless the board of directors of such district declares, and the City finds, that an emergency exists.

(b)    The district’s updated capital facilities plan may include revised data for the fee calculation and a corresponding modification to the impact fee schedule, consistent with the City GMA Comprehensive Plan.


14.100.070 Minimum requirements for district capital facilities plans.

Capital facilities plans shall contain data and analysis necessary and sufficient to meet the requirements of the GMA. The plans must provide sufficient detail to allow computation of school impact fees according to the formula contained in Section 14.100.130.


14.100.080 Department review and acceptance.

Upon receipt of the district’s capital facilities plan (or amendment thereof) the Planning Director shall determine the following:

(a)    That the analysis contained within the capital facilities plan is consistent with current data developed pursuant to the requirements of the GMA.

(b)    That any school impact fee proposed in the district’s capital facilities plan has been calculated using the formula contained in Section 14.100.130.

(c)    That the capital facilities plan has been adopted by the district’s board of directors.

Upon finding that these requirements have been satisfied, the capital facilities plan shall be transmitted to the Council for consideration and adoption.


14.100.090 Council Adoption.

The City Council shall consider adoption of the school district capital facility plan or amendment by reference as part of the capital facilities element of the City Comprehensive Plan.


14.100.100 Correction of Deficiencies.

Prior to its adoption by the Council, should the planning director find the school district capital facility plan to be deficient, the district shall be notified of the deficiency, identifying the specific matters found to be deficient, and the necessary corrections indicated. The district shall then have 45 days (or such longer period as may be necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements) to correct the deficiencies and resubmit its revised, adopted capital facilities plan.


14.100.110 Delays.

If the district fails to submit its biennial update of the capital facilities plan prior to 60 days before the expiration date, or if the Planning Director notifies the district of deficiencies in the school district capital facility plan and the district fails to correct the deficiencies within 45 days (or such longer period as may be necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements), the City shall endeavor, but shall not be obligated, to complete review prior to the plan expiration date. If an updated capital facilities plan has not been adopted by the Council prior to the existing plan’s expiration date due to the district’s failure to submit an updated plan, the district shall be ineligible to receive school impact fees until the updated plan has been adopted by the Council. (Ord. 675, 2003)


14.100.120 Fee Required.

Each development activity, as a condition of approval, shall be subject to the school impact fee established pursuant to this chapter. The school impact fee shall be calculated in accordance with the formula established in Section 14.100.130 and multiplied by 0.50 to determine the school impact fee due and payable by the applicant. (Ord. 727, Sec. 2, 2006; Ord. 711, Sec. 1, 2005; Ord. 699, Sec. 3, 2005; Ord. 675, 2003)


14.100.130 Impact Fee Calculation Formula.

(a)    The formula in this section provides the basis for the impact fee schedule for Lake Stevens School District serving the City of Lake Stevens. District capital facilities plans shall include a calculation of its proposed impact fee schedule, by dwelling unit type, utilizing this formula. In addition, a detailed listing and description of the various data and factors needed to support the fee calculation is included herein and Section 14.100.030, Definitions.

(b)    Determination of Projected School Capacity Needs. The district shall determine, as part of its capital facilities plan, projected school capacity needs for the current year and for not less than the succeeding five-year period. The capital facilities plan shall also include estimated capital costs for the additional capacity needs, and those costs shall provide the basis for the impact fee calculations set forth in this section.

(c)    Cost Calculation by Element. The fees shall be calculated on a “per dwelling unit” basis, by “dwelling unit type” as set forth below.

(1)    Site Acquisition Cost Element.

    {[B(2) x B(3)] ÷ B(1)} x A(1) = Site Acquisition Cost Element

    Where:

    B(2) = Site Size (in acres, to the nearest 1/10th)

    B(3) = Land Cost (per acre, to the nearest dollar)

    B(1) = Facility Design Capacity

    A(1) = Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type)

    The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle, junior high and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added with the result being the “total site acquisition cost element” for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below.

(2)    School Construction Cost Element.

    [C(1) ÷ B(1)] x A(1) = School Construction Cost Element

    Where:

    C(1) = Estimated Facility Construction Cost

    B(1) = Facility Design Capacity

    A(1) = Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type)

    The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle, junior high and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added and multiplied by the square footage of permanent facilities divided by the total square footage of school facilities, with the result being the total school construction cost element for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below.

(3)    Relocatable Facilities (Portables) Cost Element.

[E(1) ÷ E(2)] x A(1) =Relocatable Facilities Cost Element

Where:

E(1) =Relocatable Facilities Cost

E(2) =Relocatable Facilities Student Capacity

A(1) =Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type)

The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle, junior high and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added and multiplied by the square footage of relocatable facilities divided by the total square footage of school facilities, with the result being the total relocatable facilities cost element for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below.

(d)    Credits Against Cost Calculation – Mandatory. The following monetary credits shall be deducted from the calculated cost elements defined above for purposes of calculating the final school impact fee below.

(1)    State Match Credit.

D(1) x D(3) x D(2) x A(1) =State Match Credit

Where:

D(1) =Boeckh Index

D(3) =Square footage of school space allowed per student, by grade span, by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction

D(2) =State Match Percentage

A(1) =Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type)

The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle, junior high and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added with the result being the total state match credit for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below.

(2)    Tax Payment Credit.

[(1 + F(1))10] - 1x F(2) x F(3) = Tax Credit

F(1)(1 + F(1))10

Where:

F(1) =Interest Rate (see MMC 18C.04.020)

F(2) =District Property Tax Levy Rate

F(3) =Average Assessed Value (for each dwelling unit type)

(e)    Adjustments Against Cost Calculation – Elective by District. Recognizing that the availability of other sources of public funds varies among districts, each district may provide an additional credit against school impact fees which the district determines will provide the best balance in system improvement funding within the district, between school impact fees and other sources of local public funds available to the district. This adjustment may reduce, but may not increase, the school impact fee from the amount determined by application of the elements identified above. The adjustment, if any, applied by the district shall be specified within the capital facilities plan adopted by the city.

(f)    Calculation of Total Impact Fee.

(1)    The total school impact fee, per dwelling unit, assessed on a development activity shall be the sum of:

(i)    Total Site Acquisition Cost Element

(ii)    Total School Construction Cost Element

(iii)    Total Relocatable Facilities Cost Element

Minus the sum of:

(iv)    Total State Match Credit

(v)    Total Tax Payment Credit

(vi)    Elective Adjustment by District

Expressed in total dollars per dwelling unit, by dwelling type.

(2)    The total school impact fee obligation for each development activity pursuant to the school impact fee schedule of this chapter shall be calculated as follows:

Number of Dwelling Units, by Dwelling Unit Type multiplied by School Impact Fee for Each Dwelling Unit Type

Less

The value of any in-kind contributions proposed by the developer and accepted by the school district, as provided in this chapter.


14.100.140 Impact Fee Schedule.

The school impact fees specified in the district’s capital facilities plan and adopted by the Council shall constitute the City’s schedule of school impact fees. The Planning Department shall, for the convenience of the public, keep available an information sheet summarizing the schedule of school impact fees applicable throughout the City.


14.100.150 Service Areas Established.

For purposes of calculating and imposing school impact fees for various land use categories per unit of development, the geographic boundary of the district constitutes the service area.


14.100.160 Impact Fee Limitations.

(a)    School impact fees shall be imposed for district capital facilities that are reasonably related to the development under consideration, shall not exceed a proportionate share of the costs of system improvements that are reasonably related to the development, and shall be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development.

(b)    School impact fees must be expended or encumbered for a permissible use within six years of receipt by the district.

(c)    To the extent permitted by law, school impact fees may be collected for capital facilities costs previously incurred to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed capital facilities; provided, that school impact fees shall not be imposed to make up for any existing system deficiencies.

(d)    A developer required to pay a fee pursuant to RCW 43.21C.060 for capital facilities shall not be required to pay a school impact fee pursuant to RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.090 and this title for the same capital facilities.


14.100.170 Fee Determination.

(a)    On or before the time of development approval, the City shall determine whether school impact fees will be due pursuant to this chapter. Where such fees are due, the development approval shall state that the payment of school impact fees will be required. The amount of the impact fee due shall be based on the fee schedules in effect at the time a building permit application is accepted by the City. The impact fees shall be paid at building permit issuance, unless the applicant elects to defer payment of school impact fees pursuant to Chapter 14.124.

(b)    Credit amounts and allocation of credits to be applied against the fees shall be determined at the time of development approval in accordance with Section 14.100.180.

(c)    The final determination of a development activity’s fee obligation under this chapter shall include any credits for in-kind contributions provided under Section 14.100.180. Final determinations of the amounts of the fee or credit due may be appealed pursuant to the procedures established in Section 14.16A.265. (Ord. 970, Sec. 3, 2016; Ord. 811, Sec. 85, 2010)


14.100.180 Credit for In-kind Contributions/Existing Lots.

(a)    A developer may request and the Planning Director may grant a credit against school impact fees otherwise due under this title for the value of any dedication of land, improvement to, or new construction of any capital facilities identified in the district’s capital facilities plan provided by the developer. Such requests must be accompanied by supporting documentation of the estimated value of such in-kind contributions. All requests must be submitted to the Planning Department in writing prior to its determination of the impact fee obligation for the development activity. Each request for credit will be immediately forwarded to the affected school district for its evaluation.

(b)    Where the district determines that a development activity is eligible for a credit for a proposed in-kind contribution, it shall provide the planning department and the developer with a letter setting forth the justification for and dollar amount of the credit, the legal description of any dedicated property, and a description of the development activity to which the credit may be applied. The value of any such credit may not exceed the impact fee obligation of the development activity in question.

(c)    Where there is agreement between the developer and the school district concerning the value of proposed in-kind contributions, their eligibility for a credit, and the amount of any credit, the Planning Director may (1) approve the request for credit and adjust the impact fee obligation accordingly, and (2) require that such contributions be made as a condition of development approval. Where there is disagreement between the developer and the school district regarding the value of in-kind contributions, however, the Planning Director may render a decision that can be appealed by either party pursuant to the procedures in Section 14.16A.265.

(d)    For subdivisions, PRDs and other large-scale developments where credits for in-kind contributions or pre-existing lots are proposed or required, it may be appropriate or necessary to establish the value of the credit on a per-unit basis as a part of the development approval. Such credit values will then be recorded as part of the plat or other instrument of approval and will be used in determining the fee obligation, if any, at the time of building permit application for the development activity. In the event that such credit value is greater than the impact fee in effect at the time of permit application, the fee obligation shall be considered satisfied, and the balance of the credit may be transferable to future developments by the applicant within the same school district by agreement with the school district. (Ord. 811, Sec. 86, 2010)


14.100.190 Relationship to SEPA and Other Laws.

(a)    The City shall review development permit applications pursuant to all applicable state and local laws and regulations, including the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW), the state subdivision law (Chapter 58.17 RCW), and the Lake Stevens Municipal Code. Base on such review, the city may condition or deny development approval as necessary or appropriate to mitigate or avoid significant adverse impacts to school services and facilities, to assure that appropriate provisions are made for schools, school grounds, and safe student walking conditions, and to ensure that development is compatible and consistent with each district’s services, facilities and capital facilities plan.

(b)    Impact fees required by this chapter for development activity, together with compliance with development regulations and other mitigation measures offered or imposed at the time of development review and development activity review, shall constitute adequate mitigation for all of a development’s specific adverse environmental impacts on the school system for the purposes of Title 16. Nothing in this chapter prevents a determination of significance from being issued, the application of new or different development regulations, and/or requirements for additional environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures to the extent required by applicable law.


14.100.200 Collection and Transfer of Fees, Fund Authorized and Created.

(a)    School impact fees shall be due and payable at or before the time of issuance of residential building permits for all development activities, unless deferred pursuant to Chapter 14.124.

(b)    When a short subdivision or subdivision is approved, a note shall be included on the face of the short plat/plat indicating that the impact fee is due upon issuance of the building permit, unless deferred pursuant to Chapter 14.124. The specific language of the note shall be approved by the Planning Director or designee.

(c)    The district shall establish an interest-bearing account for collected school impact fees separate from all other district accounts.

(d)    The district shall institute a procedure for the disposition of impact fees and providing for annual reporting to the City that demonstrates compliance with the requirements of RCW 82.02.070 and other applicable laws. (Ord. 970, Sec. 4, 2016)


14.100.210 Use of Funds.

(a)    School impact fees may be used by the district only for capital facilities that are reasonably related to the development for which they were assessed and may be expended only in conformance with the district’s adopted capital facilities plan.

(b)    In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advance provision of capital facilities for which school impact fees may be expended, and where consistent with the provisions of the bond covenants and state law, school impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the capital facilities provided are consistent with the requirements of this title.

(c)    The responsibility for assuring that school impact fees are used for authorized purposes rests with the district. All interest earned on a school impact fee account must be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which the school impact fees were imposed, subject to the provisions of Section 14.100.220.

(d)    The district shall provide the City an annual report showing the source and the amount of school impact fees received by the district and the capital facilities financed in whole or in part with those school impact fees.


14.100.220 Refunds.

(a)    School impact fees not spent or encumbered within six years after they were collected by the school district shall, upon receipt of a proper and accurate claim, be refunded by the school district together with interest to the then-current owner(s) of the property(ies). In determining whether school impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis. The school district shall report annually to the City Finance Director any funds collected by the school district that have not been spent or encumbered. The City shall, based on the annual report received from the school district pursuant to Section 14.100.210(d), give notice to the last known address of potential claimants of any funds collected by the school district that have not been spent or encumbered and that a claim for a refund may be made.

(b)    Any claim for a refund of school impact fees paid to the school district shall be filed with the City Finance Director and the school district within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises, or the date of notification provided for above, whichever is later. Refunds for school impact fees shall be paid by the school district.


14.100.230 Reimbursement for City Administrative Costs, Legal Expenses, and Refund Payments.

The district shall enter into an interlocal agreement with the City of Lake Stevens providing for the collection, distribution and expenditure of fees and for reimbursement of any legal expenses and staff time associated with defense of this chapter, and payment of any refunds provided under Section 14.100.220.


14.100.240 Adjustment of Fee Amount.

(a)    Within 14 days of acceptance by the city of a building permit application, a developer or school district may appeal to the Planning Director for an adjustment to the fees imposed by this title. The Director may adjust the amount of the fee, in consideration of studies and data submitted by the developer and or the district, if one of the following circumstances exists:

(1)    It can be demonstrated that the school impact fee assessment was incorrectly calculated;

(2)    Unusual circumstances of the development activity demonstrate that application of the school impact fee to the development would be unfair or unjust;

(3)    A credit for in-kind contributions by the developer, as provided for under Section 14.100.180, is warranted; or

(4)    Any other credit specified in RCW 82.02.060(1)(b) may be warranted.

(b)    To avoid delay pending resolution of the appeal, school impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a development approval.

(c)    Failure to exhaust this administrative remedy shall preclude appeals of the school impact fee pursuant to Section 14.16A.265. (Ord. 811, Sec. 87, 2010; Ord. 675, Sec. 1 & 2, 2003: Ord. 371, 1991)

14.110.115    Concurrency of Projects Vested in the County Pre-Annexation

14.110.120    Appeals


14.110.010 Purpose.

This chapter provides the necessary regulatory mechanism for determining if a development proposal meets the concurrency provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and to ensure that public facilities are available to support the development’s impact at adopted levels of service.


14.110.020 Applicability.

(a)    This chapter applies to:

(1)    All development approval applications filed after its effective date.

(2)    Changes of occupancy that result in increased demand on public parks, roads or sewer.

(3)    Reconstruction of buildings that results in an increase in vehicular trips, housing units or sewage demand in excess of the pre-existing demand on roads, parks and/or sewer facilities.


14.110.030 Exemptions.

(a)    No Impact. Development which creates no measurable additional impacts on any transportation or parks facility is exempt from the requirements of this chapter. This type of development includes, but is not necessarily limited to:

(1)    Any addition or accessory structure to a residence with no change in use or increase in the number of dwelling units.

(2)    Interior renovations with increase in floor area and no change of use or, if a residential use, no increase in the number of dwelling units.

(3)    Replacement structure with no change in use, no increase in floor area or, if a residential use, no increase in the number of dwelling units.

(4)    Temporary construction trailers.

(5)    Driveway resurfacing or parking lot paving.

(6)    Normal repair and maintenance which do not increase floor area or add residential dwelling units, such as re-roofing.

(7)    Demolitions.

(8)    Clearing, grading, filling.

(9)    The Public Works and Planning and Community Development Departments shall jointly be responsible for determining if other types of development also meet this “no impact” standard so as to be included under this exemption.

(b)    Exempt Permits and Decisions. The following development permits and decisions are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

(1)    Boundary line adjustment.

(2)    Final plat.

(3)    Land use permit for temporary uses such as fireworks stands and Christmas tree lots.

(4)    Variance when not associated with a development that is subject to this chapter.

(5)    Clearing, filling and grading permit.

(6)    Sign permit.

(7)    Building permit for a fence.

(8)    Right-of-way use permit.

(9)    Rezones/comprehensive plan amendments. 

(10)    Planned action projects. (Ord. 876, Sec. 22, 2012; Ord. 811, Sec. 88, 2010)


14.110.040 Level of Service Standards.

(a)    Transportation. All City streets shall maintain an LOS C or better at peak hour traffic in residential areas and LOS E along arterials and collectors in other areas at peak hour.

(b)    As part of the subarea plans, the level of service for the subareas has been modified from an intersection LOS Standard “C” or “E” to a system LOS Standard “E” for each subarea. The system would consist of key intersections and connecting roads servicing each subarea. Under this approach, the LOS analysis would take the accumulative average LOS from intersections within the transportation network, while excluding intersections with State Route facilities. 

(1)    For the 20th Street SE Corridor Subarea, this would include all intersections within the defined subarea boundaries of the 20th Street SE Corridor with the exclusion of SR-9 intersections.

(2)    For the Lake Stevens Center Subarea, this would include all intersections within the defined subarea boundaries of the Lake Stevens Center excluding SR-9 and SR-204 intersections.

(3)    For the Downtown Lake Stevens Subarea, this would include all intersections within the defined subarea boundaries. The westbound leg of the intersection at Main Street/20th Street NE may fall below the defined LOS standard in 2035. Over the plan horizon, it is reasonable to accept a reduced LOS standard for the PM peak at this intersection because of physical constraints and given the vision for a mixed use district that functions as a local and regional destination, with the inclusion of multimodal transportation elements that emphasizes safe pedestrian amenities to maintain the character of the district.

(c)    For the purpose of this section, transportation level of service shall be the percentage of the capacity of the roadway (number of cars that a road is capable of handling) which is actually used by traffic during any one hour. For example, if the roadway has a capacity to serve 100 cars per hour, and it is observed that there are 70 cars per hour on that road, the percentage is 70 percent, which is also called a volume/capacity ratio. LOS C shall be defined as having a volume/capacity ratio greater than 70 percent and less than or equal to 80 percent. For LOS D, that ratio is greater than 80 percent and less than or equal to 90 percent. For LOS E, that ratio is greater than 90 percent and less than or equal to 100 percent.

(d)    Parks. Per the Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 1027, Sec. 8, 2018; Ord. 876, Sec. 23, 2012)


14.110.050 Relationship to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

This chapter establishes minimum standards which are to be applied to all proposals in order to provide transportation, parks and sewer improvements and is not intended to eliminate the application of SEPA to specific proposals. Each proposal shall be reviewed and be subject to the substantive authority of SEPA.


14.110.060 Administration

The Directors of Public Works and Planning and Community Development shall be responsible for the administration of this chapter including but not limited to determining application submittal requirements, records maintenance, monitoring and evaluation, and administration of a capacity waiting list.


14.110.070 Review of Development Proposals - Concurrency Testing

(a)    Application. Any proposed development which is subject to the chapter will be reviewed by the Planning and Public Works Directors to determine its impact on the transportation, parks, and sewer facilities. This review may be conducted before a development application is submitted to the City.

(b)    Certificate of Concurrency Approval. A certificate of concurrency will be issued under this chapter if it is determined that the adopted LOS for transportation, parks and sewer are met; and the project will not degrade the LOS below the adopted standard. Concurrency testing may rely on:

(1)    Capacity provided by fully funded projects, including projects in the current six-year Capital Facilities Plan;

(2)    Projects funded for construction within six years by other agencies or jurisdictions; and

(3)    Improvements under contract as part of other approved development proposals.



(4)    The concurrency testing shall take into account development projects already in the pipeline but not yet completed. Development in the pipeline includes projects that either were vested prior to the adoption of this chapter or have received a certificate of concurrency.

(c)    Transferability. A certificate of concurrency runs with the land, is valid only for the subsequent development approvals for the same parcel, and is transferable to new owners of the original parcel for which it was issued.

(d)    Expiration. A certificate of concurrency will expire when:

(1)    A complete land use or building permit application is not submitted within 120 days of the date of issuance; or

(2)    The underlying land use permit application expires; or

(3)    The accompanying land use or building permit expires. If that permit has no expiration date, the certificate of concurrency shall expire 12 months following its issuance; or

(4)    The permit application is denied or revoked.

(e)    Once a certificate of concurrency expires, is revoked, or if development does not use the total capacity allotted, the unused capacity will be returned to the available pool of capacity.

(f)    Certificate of Concurrency Denial. A certificate of concurrency will not be approved under this chapter if degradation is caused beyond the adopted LOS standard unless mitigated to meet the LOS standard.


14.110.080 Methods for Meeting Concurrency.

(a)    If mitigation is required to meet the LOS standard to maintain concurrency, the applicant may choose to:

(1)    Reduce the size of the development until the standard is met; or

(2)    Delay the development until the City and/or others provide needed improvements; or

(3)    Design and construct the facilities necessary to achieve the LOS in compliance with Section 14.110.090.


14.110.090 Requirements for Design and Construction of Facilities Necessary to Achieve Adopted Levels of Service.

(a)    If the developer chooses to design and construct the facilities necessary to achieve the adopted LOS standard(s), the following requirements must be met:

(1)    Issuance of a final plat or building permit approval, which ever comes first, will not be made unless improvements are made by the developer or sufficient financial security pursuant to Section 14.16A.180(e) is in place to ensure the improvements will be made within six years of the issuance of the approval. This allowance for up to a six-year deferral applies only to supplemental mitigation not normally required of the development.

(2)    The developer shall be responsible for engineering and design of the facilities and shall provide documentation showing the improvements will ensure the LOS is met. The developer shall receive City approval of the engineering and design of the facilities, which shall be consistent with accepted engineering standards and practices.

(3)    The developer shall enter into a detailed agreement with the City identifying the improvements required and the schedule for their completion. This shall include any necessary interim deadlines necessary to ensure the improvements are completed within the six-year time frame.

(4)    If a developer makes improvements to the sewer general facilities, those cost of those improvements shall be credited against the developer’s general facilities charges, except no such credit shall be given if the developer is to be reimbursed through a latecomer’s agreement. The credit shall not exceed the general facilities charge that would normally be applied to the project.

(5)    If a developer makes improvements to a transportation project that would otherwise require SEPA mitigation, the developer shall be given credit for the amount spent on that project against the SEPA mitigation required for that project, but not to exceed the mitigation that would normally be applied to the project.

(6)    The effect of the improvement shall not degrade another related objective. For example, adding a vehicular lane at the expense of eliminating a bike lane.

(7)    The project shall comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

(8)    The improvements shall not create a significant safety hazard.

(b)    Supplemental Mitigation Denial Process. If the City determines that the proposed supplemental mitigation does not meet the requirements of this section, the Public Works and Planning and Community Development Directors may deny the issuance of a certificate of concurrency. (Ord. 811, Sec. 89, 2010)


14.110.100 Implementation of Strategies in Lieu of Capital Improvements.

(a)    With approval from the Public Works and Planning and Community Development Directors, nonconstruction strategies for reducing demand for public facilities to assure LOS are met may be implemented if the following requirements are met:

(1)    The proponent clearly demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the proposed strategies have a demonstrated historical track record for effectiveness and reliability for projects similar to that being proposed.

(2)    The proponent shall provide an analysis as to how much capacity is available, which will provide a maximum amount of demand the project may put upon the public improvements.

(3)    The effectiveness of the strategies must be easily measured and annual reports must be provided to the City to ensure the demand actually put on the public improvements does not exceed the amount allocated to the development pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.

(4)    The developer shall provided a financial guarantee for a period of up to ten years which the City may use to construct the necessary improvements, at any time during that ten year period, where it finds the demands on the public system exceed the amounts allocated to the project.

(b)    For the purposes of this section, nonconstruction strategies include any programs which reduce demand for public facilities during peak hour constraints, including but not limited to car/van pooling, staggered work hours, or transfer flow of sewer use to off-peak hours.


14.110.110 Fees.

The City shall charge processing fees to any individual that requests a concurrency determination or approval of a supplemental mitigation program. The fees shall be set by Council resolution.


14.110.115 Concurrency of Projects Vested in the County Pre-Annexation.*

Pursuant to the terms of an interlocal agreement with Snohomish County, the City will accept the County’s concurrency determination for projects vested to the County Code, where the subject property of a vested application has been annexed to the City since the concurrency determination was made by the County. The terms of the concurrency, including expiration, shall be regulated by the vested County code. (Ord. 859, Sec. 2, 2011)

*    Code reviser’s note: Section 3 of Ordinance 859 adopts sections of the Snohomish County Code concerning mitigation fees and concurrency determination. The text of these sections is attached as Exhibit 1 to the ordinance, on file with the City Clerk’s office.


14.110.120 Appeals.

Appeals of requirements imposed pursuant to the chapter shall be governed by the appeal provisions of Section 14.16A.265. (Ord. 903, Sec. 56, 2013; Ord. 643, Sec. 1, 2001)

*    Code reviser’s note: Ordinance 955 establishes a temporary traffic impact fee adjustment to stimulate growth of new retail businesses within established subareas, pursuant to Section 14.112.080(d). The ordinance is effective from August 31, 2016, to August 22, 2019, unless extended by ordinance.


14.112.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the Capital Facilities Element of the Lake Stevens Comprehensive Plan and the Growth Management Act by:

(a)    Ensuring adequate public street system facilities are available to serve traffic from new development.

(b)    Ensuring adequate public streets are available to serve growth and maintain existing service levels for present businesses and residents.

(c)    Establishing procedures whereby new development pays its proportionate share of the costs of street system capacity improvements, reducing transaction costs for both the City and developers, ensuring new developments do not pay arbitrary or duplicative fees. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.020 Authority.

This chapter is adopted under RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100, which authorize cities planning under the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, to assess, collect, and use impact fees to help finance public facilities needed to accommodate growth. Under the authority of RCW 36.70A.070(3) and 82.02.050(4), the City is authorized to impose, collect, and use impact fees. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.030 Applicability.

This chapter applies to all new development, except as may be exempted below. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.040 Exemptions.

The exemptions for traffic impact fees are the same as for concurrency in Section 14.110.030 except for planned action projects identified in Section 14.110.030(b)(10), which are not exempt under this chapter. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.050 Service Areas.

For the provision of public streets, implementation of the Capital Facilities and Transportation Elements of the Comprehensive Plan and administration of this chapter, three traffic impact zones (TIZ) are established. They consist of TIZ 1 - East Lake Stevens, TIZ 2 - West Lake Stevens, and TIZ 3 - South Lake Stevens. The precise boundaries of these service areas are shown in Figure 14.112-I.

14.112.060 Mitigation of Traffic Impacts Required.

Any new development activity shall mitigate the development’s impacts on the City’s street system either by payment of an amount calculated pursuant to Section 14.112.080, or by dedication of land pursuant to Section 14.112.090, by construction of off-site street system capacity improvements pursuant to Section 14.112.090, or as otherwise provided in Section 14.112.070. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.070 Relationship to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

This chapter establishes minimum impact fees, applied to all developments. These fees are presumed to mitigate traffic demand on the capacity of the city street system. However, each development shall be reviewed and be subject to the substantive authority of SEPA for potential adverse traffic impacts on the street system not mitigated by this fee. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.080 Calculation of Street System Impact Fees.

(a)    The traffic impact fees will be collected and spent for capacity improvements to the public street system identified in the City’s Capital Facilities Plan. In accordance with RCW 82.02.050(3), the impact fees shall only be imposed for system improvements reasonably related to development impacts and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the costs of the identified system improvements in the adopted Capital Facilities Plan.

(b)    The street system impact fee cost basis is established in the Traffic Impact Fee Cost Basis for the City of Lake Stevens, as amended, based on methodology consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100 including, but not limited to, the following:

(1)    Street system capacity improvements identified in the City GMA Capital Facilities Plan that are reasonably necessary to maintain adopted street system levels of service while accommodating the future development envisioned in the City’s adopted GMA Comprehensive Plan.

(2)    The costs of the needed street system capacity improvements estimated by the Public Works Director using generally accepted engineering practices.

(3)    The estimated costs adjusted (reduced) to account for portions of the identified street system improvements that will likely be constructed by new development as part of their required on-site public street improvements and/or frontage improvements.

(4)    The estimated costs adjusted (reduced) to provide a credit for taxes (excluding impact fees paid under this section) paid by new development which help pay for the identified capacity improvements.

(5)    The estimated costs adjusted (reduced) to account for any improvements needed to remedy any level of service deficiencies in the street system serving existing uses. 

(6)    The estimated costs adjusted (reduced) to reflect impacts on the capacity of the street system from new vehicle trips which have neither origin nor destination within the City of Lake Stevens (often referred to as “pass-through” trips).

(7)    The final adjusted total costs of the identified improvements, as adjusted above, and aggregated for each traffic impact zone, are the cost basis of the impact fee.

(8)    The number of weekday afternoon (PM) peak hour trips likely generated by existing land uses and future land uses (i.e., new development) are estimated based on current land use data and the adopted GMA Comprehensive Plan future land use map. The total existing and new trips are aggregated into the traffic impact zones.

(9)    The maximum impact fee that can legally be charged to new development for each new weekday PM peak hour trip generated equals the cost basis of the impact fee divided by the new weekday PM peak hour trips for each traffic impact zone.

(10)    The actual level of impact fees as established in Traffic Impact Fee Cost Basis for the City of Lake Stevens, as amended, shall not exceed the maximum as calculated above.

(c)    A development shall mitigate its traffic impact upon the future capacity of the street system by paying an impact fee reasonably related to the impact of the development on public streets located in the same traffic impact zone as the development. A development’s street system impact fee will equal the number of new average weekday afternoon (PM) peak-hour trips generated by the development, based on the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Report, times the per trip amount identified in the currently adopted fees resolution, for the type and location of the development, except that the following adjustments may be made:

(1)    In accordance with RCW 82.02.060(5), the Public Works Director shall have the authority to adjust the amount of the impact fee to consider unusual circumstances in specific cases, based on analysis of specific trip generating characteristics of the development (e.g., mixed-use characteristics, ridesharing programs, transit availability, etc.), to ensure that impact fees are fairly imposed; and

(2)    In accordance with RCW 82.02.060(5), the Public Works Director shall have the authority to adjust the amount of the impact fee to be imposed on a particular development to reflect local information when available, including studies and data submitted by the developer. 

(d)    The City Council shall have the authority to adjust the amount of the impact fees pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(2) to reflect other public benefits resulting from proposed development or redevelopment in accordance with specific programs as determined and adopted by the City Council. Public benefits and/or broad public purposes for adjustments primarily include the economic development goals identified in the City’s Comprehensive Plan related to job creation and growth of new retail sales tax receipts. The City Council shall identify the public funding source other than impact fees collected to compensate for any reductions in impact fees pursuant to this provision. (Ord. 922, Sec. 1, 2014; Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.090 Offsets.

(a)    The required traffic impact fees shall be reduced by the amount of any payment for public street system improvements previously made for the development either as a condition of approval or under voluntary agreements with the City entered into after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(b)    Whenever a development has agreed to, pursuant to the terms of a voluntary agreement with the City, or is granted approval subject to a condition that the developer provide right-of-way for or construct off-site street system capacity improvements that are identified in the Traffic Impact Fee Cost Basis for the City of Lake Stevens, as amended, as being part of the street system impact fee cost basis, the developer shall be entitled to an offset for up to the value of land or up to the actual cost of construction against the impact fee assessed under Section 14.112.060.

(c)    The land value or cost of construction shall be estimated at the time of approval and shall be based on acceptable evidence and documentation provided by the developer. The evidence and documentation shall be reviewed and, if acceptable, approved by the Public Works Director or designee. When land is proposed for dedication, the person required to pay impact fees shall present either a Member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI) appraisal or evidence of the assessed value as determined by the County Assessor’s Office. If construction costs are estimated, the documentation shall be confirmed after the construction is completed to assure that an accurate offset amount is provided. If the land value or construction cost is less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as an impact fee. 

(d)    The amount of the offset for a development activity shall not exceed the amount of the impact fee the development activity is required to pay.

(e)    Any claim for offset should be made at least 30 days prior to application for a building permit so as to eliminate or minimize any delays in issuance of a permit. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.100 Collection of Impact Fees.

Impact fees for each development shall be assessed and collected at the time of issuance of a building permit, unless deferred pursuant to Chapter 14.124. Where no building permit will be associated with the development, such as a development requiring a conditional use permit, payment is required as a precondition to approval. (Ord. 970, Sec. 5, 2016; Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.110 Uses of Traffic Impact Fee Revenues.

(a)    Traffic impact fee revenue will be used for capital improvements on the public street system, not operating or maintenance expenses.

(b)    Traffic impact fees shall be used for costs associated with City street system capacity improvements, including, but not limited to, planning, design, engineering, right-of-way acquisition, financing, project administration, construction, and/or construction engineering.

(c)    In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of system improvements, for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with provisions of the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.

(d)    Traffic impact fees are collected and spent on street system improvements as opposed to project improvements, in accordance with RCW 82.02.090. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.120 Expenditure Requirements for Impact Fees.

Traffic impact fee payments not expended within 10 years shall be refunded, pursuant to Section 14.112.130; unless the City Council makes written findings that there exists an extraordinary and compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years. In order to verify these two requirements, impact fee revenues must be deposited into separate accounts of the City, and annual reports must describe revenue and expenditures. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)


14.112.130 Refund of Fees Paid.

(a)    Traffic impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into an interest bearing account established for the City.

(b)    If a development approval expires without commencement of construction, then the developer shall be entitled to a refund of impact fees paid, with interest, of the impact fee paid for that development. The developer must submit an application for such a refund to the Finance Director within 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit. By resolution, the City Council may adopt fees to offset administrative costs of collecting and refunding mitigation fees.

(c)    Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of 10 years from the date the fee was paid shall be returned to the developer/owner with interest; provided, that the developer/owner submits a request for a refund to the City of Lake Stevens within one year of the expiration of the 10-year period.

(d)    Impact fees that are not expended or encumbered within these time limitations, and for which no application of a refund has been made in accordance with this section, shall be retained and expended on public street system facilities.

(e)    Interest due upon the refund of impact fees shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the City on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 876, Sec. 6 (Exh. 4), 2012)

14.120.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the capital facilities element of the Lake Stevens comprehensive plan and the Growth Management Act by:

(a)    Ensuring adequate park, recreation, open space and trail facilities are available to serve new development.

(b)    Maintaining the high quality of life in Lake Stevens by ensuring adequate facilities are available to serve growth and maintaining existing service levels for present businesses and residents.

(c)    Establishing standards and procedures whereby new development pays its proportionate share of the costs of park, recreation, open space and trail facilities, thereby reducing transaction costs for both the City and developers and ensuring new developments are not required to pay arbitrary or duplicative fees. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.020 Authority.

This chapter is adopted under RCW 82.02.050(2), which authorizes cities planning under the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, to assess, collect, and use impact fees to pay for park, recreation, open space and trail facilities needed to accommodate growth. The City of Lake Stevens is required to plan under the Growth Management Act and has adopted a comprehensive plan, which includes a capital facilities element which complies with RCW 36.70A.070(3) and 82.02.050(4), and all other applicable requirements. Consequently, the City of Lake Stevens is authorized to impose, collect, and use impact fees. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.030 Applicability.

This chapter applies to all new residential development, except as may be exempted below. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.040 Exemptions.

The following development activities shall be exempted from payment of impact fees:

(a)    Reconstruction, remodeling or construction of the following facilities:

(1)    Shelters or dwelling units for temporary placement which provide housing to persons on a temporary basis for not more than four weeks.

(2)    Construction or remodeling of transitional housing facilities or dwelling units that provide housing to persons on a temporary basis for not more than 24 months, in connection with job training, self-sufficiency training and human services counseling the purpose of which is to help persons make the transition from homelessness to placement in permanent housing.

(b)    Rebuilding or replacement of legally established dwellings that have been destroyed or damaged; provided, that such rebuilding takes place within one year after destruction.

(c)    Alteration or expansion of an existing building where no additional dwellings are created.

(d)    Care homes for the elderly, except portions thereof which provide independent living dwellings. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.050 Service Areas.

For the provision of parks, implementation of the capital facilities and parks and recreation elements of the comprehensive plan and administration of this chapter, a single parks service area encompassing the entire City is hereby established. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.060 Mitigation of Park and Recreation Impacts Required.

Any person who applies for a building permit for any development activity shall mitigate the development’s impacts on the City’s park and recreation service levels either by payment of an amount calculated pursuant to Section 14.120.080 or 14.120.090, or by dedication of land pursuant to Section 14.120.100 or as otherwise provided in Section 14.120.070. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.070 Relationship to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

This chapter establishes minimum impact fees which are to be applied to all residential developments. These fees are presumed to mitigate demand impacts of residential uses on parks. However, each development shall be reviewed and be subject to the substantive authority of SEPA for potential adverse impacts on parks not mitigated by this fee. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.080 Calculation of Impact Fee.

Impact fees may be calculated based on the adopted capital facilities plan and computed either by using adopted impact fee schedules (subsection (a) of this section), calculation using a specified formula (subsection (b) of this section), or by independent fee calculation (Section 14.120.090). 

(a)    Impact Fee Schedules for Park Acquisition and Park Development. When a capital facilities plan for park facilities and acquisition has been adopted, the impact fee shall be calculated using the impact fee schedules.

(1)    When using the impact fee schedules in subsection (a)(6) of this section, the impact fees shall be calculated by using the following formula:

	Number of units of each type of residential use	x	Impact fee amount for a facility type	=	Amount of impact fee that shall be paid for that facility type for that use

(2)    The number of units of each type of residential use shall be determined by the number and type of housing units for which a building permit application has been made; and 

(3)    Using the formula in subsection (a)(1) of this section, impact fees shall be calculated separately for each residential use and each facility type. The impact fees that shall be paid are the sum of these calculations.

(4)    If the type of use or development activity is not specified on the impact fee schedules in this section, the Planning Director shall use the impact fee applicable to the most comparable type of residential use on the fee schedules. The Planning Director shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the most recent Standard Industrial Code Manual and the Lake Stevens development code. If the Planning Director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the above fee schedule, the Planning Director shall determine the proper fee by considering demographic or other documentation which is available from state, local, and regional authorities.

(5)    In the case of a change in use, development activity, redevelopment, or expansion or modification of an existing use, the impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the impact fee based on either the number of dwelling units or square feet of commercial or industrial area for the new development activity as compared to the previous development activity. The Planning Director shall be guided in this determination by the sources and agencies listed above.

(6)    Facility-Type Impact Fee Schedule.

	Residential Use	Units 	Impact Fee per Unit 

	Single-family residences (including mobile/manufactured homes, duplexes and attached single-family homes)	1 housing unit	Established in capital facilities plan using formula below

	Multifamily residences	1 housing unit	Established in capital facilities plan using formula below

Formula for Determining per Unit Amount of Park Impact Fee. For assessing impacts of residential properties, the capital facility plan is used as the basis for the fee calculation.

IF:

A =    Parks, recreation, open space or trails capital facility program

B =    City of Lake Stevens contribution

C =    Percent of total park use demanded by land use category

D =    Projected growth by number of units per land use category

F =     Developer fee obligation

THEN:

F = [(A - B) x C]/D

(b)    Impact Fee Formula for Park Acquisition. The formula below shall be used to develop mitigation fees for public park and recreation facilities when a capital facilities plan for park property acquisition, but not for park facilities, has been adopted.

(1)    The formula shall be reviewed with the annual comprehensive plan amendment and modified to reflect changes in acquisition baseline costs.

(2)    Park Land Acquisition Costs. The average costs of developable land suitable for public park purposes within the general vicinity of the City of Lake Stevens has been determined to be at least $150,000 an acre.

(3)    Level of Service. The level of service standard for parks established in the capital facilities element of the comprehensive plan is 7.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents.

(4)    Household Size. In determining the average household size various sources have been consulted including the City of Lake Stevens Comprehensive Plan, City of Lake Stevens Land Use Code, and the Office of Financial Management. As a result, for the purpose of implementing this section, the average household sizes are as follows:

(i)    Single-Family Residential – 3.0 persons.

(ii)    Duplex – 2.2 persons.

(iii)    Zero to One Bedroom Apartment – 1.4 persons.

(iv)    Two Bedroom Apartment – 2.2 persons.

(v)    Three Plus Bedroom Apartment – 3.0 persons.

(5)    Adjustment Rate. In accordance with RCW 82.02.050 and 82.02.060, the City shall provide a balance between impact fees and other sources of public funds to meet its capital projects needs. Revenues from property taxes, user fees (if imposed), sales taxes, real estate excise taxes, grants, and other revenue sources need to be used to pay the proportionate share of the growth-generated capital facilities costs.

(6)    For the purpose of calculating park impact fees, 70 percent of the cost of park development is anticipated to be generated locally. The remaining 30 percent is expected to originate from City, county or state sources. Thus the mitigation assessment reflects a 30 percent discount from the actual acquisition costs.

(7)    The formula is thus:

(i)    X acres per person x capital cost per acre = park capital cost per person = 0.0075 x $150,000 = $1,125 per person.

(ii)    Capital cost per person x persons per household = capital cost per household =

a.    Single-Family Residential = $1,125 x 3.0 = $3,375.

b.    Duplex = $1,125 x 2.2 = $2,475.

c.    Apartment 0 – 1 bedrooms = $1,125 x 1.4 = $1,575.

d.    Apartments 2 bedrooms = $1,125 x 2.2 = $2,475.

e.    Apartments 3+ bedrooms = $1,125 x 3.0 = $3,375.

(iii)    Capital Cost per Household x Adjustment Rate per Household = Impact Fee per Household =

a.    Single Family = $3,375 x 0.70 = $2,363.

b.    Duplex = $2,475 x 0.70 = $1,733.

c.    Apartment 0 – 1 bedrooms = $1,575 x 0.70 = $1,103.

d.    Apartments 2 bedrooms = $2,475 x 0.70 = $1,733.

e.    Apartments 3+ bedrooms = $3,375 x 0.70 = $2,363. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.090 Independent Fee Calculations.

If a developer elects not to have the impact fee determined according to Section 14.120.080, then:

(a)    The developer shall prepare and submit to the City an independent fee calculation study for determining the development’s mitigation obligation. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

(b)    The Planning Director shall consider the documentation submitted by the developer but is not required to accept such documentation if it is found to be inaccurate or not reliable. If such findings are made, the director shall require the developer to submit additional documentation for consideration.

(c)    If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is presented, the director may adjust the fee as may be appropriate to the particular development, in consideration of the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness.

(d)    When a developer requests an independent fee calculation, all costs of such calculation shall be borne by the developer.

(e)    Following approval of a fee pursuant to this section, the Planning Director shall report the facts and decision to the Planning Commission and City Council, who in turn, may provide feedback as to the future administration and implementation of this section. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.100 Credits.

(a)    Credits.

(1)    The required park impact fees shall be reduced by the amount of any payment for park, recreation, open space or trail facilities system improvements previously made for the lot on which the development activity will take place either as a condition of approval or under voluntary agreements with the City entered into after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(2)    Whenever a development is granted approval subject to a condition that the developer actually provide sites, facilities, or improvements for parks, recreation, open space, or trails acceptable to the City, or whenever the developer has agreed, pursuant to the terms of a voluntary agreement with the City, to provide land, park capital facilities, or to improve existing facilities, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for up to the value of land or up to the actual cost of construction against the impact fee that would be chargeable under Section 14.120.060.

(i)    The land value or cost of construction shall be estimated at the time of approval and shall be based on acceptable evidence and documentation. The evidence and documentation shall be reviewed and, if acceptable, approved by the Planning Director. When land is proposed for dedication, the person required to pay impact fees shall present either an MAI appraisal or evidence of the assessed value as determined by the county assessor’s office. If construction costs are estimated, the documentation shall be confirmed after the construction is completed to assure that an accurate credit amount is provided. If the land value or construction cost is less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as an impact fee for the facility for which the land, system facilities, or improved system facilities were provided.

(ii)    In certain cases a park, recreation, open space or trail system improvement may function as a project improvement. Where a system improvement functions as a project improvement, the person who is required to pay impact fees shall only receive a credit for the amount of the improvement that functions as a park improvement.

(3)    The amount of the credit for a development activity shall not exceed the amount of the impact fee the development activity is required to pay.

(4)    If a development activity includes construction of park, recreation, open space or trail facilities, which meet the requirements of this subsection, then the applicant shall be entitled to a credit for that portion of the park impact fee to be used for that park, recreation, open space or trail facility-type to the extent that the park, recreation, open space or trail system satisfies the needs of the occupants of the development activity and the public.

(i)    The credit shall equal either:

a.    The reduction in demand by occupants of the development on the City’s park system that is met by the facility; or 

b.    The reduction in demand by the general public on the City’s park system that is met by the facility, if the facility is open to the general public and signs at the facility notify the public that they can use the facility. To be eligible for the credit in this subsection, the facility shall be located in an area which, based upon adopted level of service standards, is lacking in needed park, recreation, open space or trail facilities. Credit under this subsection shall not be given for the portion of any facility which provides a higher level of service than that set by the level of service standard for that facility.

(ii)    To be eligible for a credit, the park, recreation, open space or trail facilities shall function as a park, recreation, open space or trail system improvement and not as a project improvement as defined by this chapter.

(b)    Any claim for credit should be made at least 30 days prior to application for a building permit so as to eliminate or minimize any delays in issuance of a permit. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.110 Reserved.

Reserved. (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.120 Collection of Impact Fees.

Impact fees for each lot shall be assessed and collected at the time of issuance of a building permit, unless deferred pursuant to Chapter 14.124. (Ord. 970, Sec. 6, 2016; Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.130 Uses of Impact Fee Revenues.

(a)    Park impact fee revenue can be used for the capital cost of public facilities, not operating or maintenance expenses.

(b)    Park impact fees shall be used for park planning, architectural and/or engineering design studies, land surveys, land acquisition, engineering, permitting, financing, administrative expenses, construction, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, applicable application or impact fees, required mitigation costs, and capital equipment pertaining to recreation facilities, relocatable improvement costs previously incurred by the City to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the system improvements, and any other expenses which could be capitalized and are consistent with the capital facilities element.

(c)    In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with provisions of the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.

(d)    Park facilities that can be paid for by impact fees are system improvements, which are typically located outside the development, and designed to provide service to the community at large as provided in RCW 82.02.090(9), as opposed to project improvements, which are typically provided by the developer on-site within the development or adjacent to the development, and designed to provide service for a development project, and that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the project as provided in RCW 82.02.090(6). (Ord. 794, Sec. 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


14.120.131 Expenditure Requirements for Impact Fees.

By resolution, the City Council may adopt fees to offset administrative costs of collecting and refunding mitigation fees.

(c)    Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of six years from the date the fee was paid shall be returned to such landowner with interest; provided, that the landowner submits a request for a refund to the City of Lake Stevens within one year of the expiration of the six-year period.

16.04.030 Lead Agency Determination and Responsibilities.

(a)    When receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action, the City shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050, 197-11-253, and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the City is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

(b)    When the City is not the lead agency for a proposal, the City shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. The City shall not prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the City may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

(c)    If the City receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within fifteen days of receipt of the determination, or the City must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period.

(d)    The City, by decisions of the responsible official, can make agreements as to lead agency status or share lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944.

(e)    In making a lead agency determination for a private project, the City shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal.

(f)    When the City is lead agency for a Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) remedial action, the City shall provide the Department of Ecology an opportunity, under WAC 197-11-253(5), to review the environmental documents prior to public notice being provided. If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with one public comment period, under WAC 197-11-253(6), the City shall decide jointly with the Department of Ecology who receives the comment letters and how copies of the comment letters will be distributed to the other agency. (Ord. 870, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2012)


16.04.035 Transfer of Lead Agency Status to a State Agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the City would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the City’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the City shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the City’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer with any available relevant information, on the proposal, to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The City’s responsible official shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 870, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2012)


16.04.040 Additional Timing Considerations.

(a)    For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the City’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body.

(b)    If the City’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license, not subject to the notice of application requirements of RCW 36.70B.110 or Section 14.16A.225, but that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the City conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications.

Local conditions, including zoning or other land use plans or regulations, implemented by ordinance, shall support any raised categorical exemption level. If the City increases any categorical exemptions levels, they shall send these to the Department of Ecology. The maximum level that any such category exemption may be raised is specified in WAC 197-11-800(1)(c). (Ord. 870, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2012)


16.04.055 Use of Exemptions.

(a)    When the City receives an application or request for a proposed project or non-project action, the responsible official shall determine if the action is properly defined per WAC 197-11-060 and categorically exempt per WAC 197-11-800. The determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter applies to the proposal. The City shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

(b)    If a proposed project or nonproject action includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the City may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that the City shall not authorize:

(1)    Any nonexempt action;

(2)    Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or

(3)    Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives. (Ord. 870, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2012)


16.04.060 Environmental Checklist.

(a)    A project proponent shall submit a completed environmental checklist (or a copy), substantially in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960 or as hereafter amended, when they submit a permit application, license, certificate, or other project proposal not specifically exempted in this chapter. The City shall use the completed environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the City is the lead agency, for making the threshold determination.

(b)    The City will not require an environmental checklist when the City and applicant agree that an EIS is required; another agency, acting as lead agency, has prepared its own EIS for a public proposal; or when the proposed project or non-project action qualifies as a planned action, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.

(c)    For private proposals, the City will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist and the City will provide assistance as necessary, for example the City may provide relevant, available technical information to the private applicant; or notify them if material provided is inaccurate.

(d)    For City proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

(e)    For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the City shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with the planned action ordinance, or developed after adoption of the planned action ordinance. In either case, the City must send the Department of Ecology the modified environmental checklist form to allow the Department at least a 30-day review of the form prior to its use. (Ord. 870, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2012)


16.04.065 Mitigated DNS.

(a)    As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

(b)    An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(1)    Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

(2)    Precede the City’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

(c)    The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 14 days in conformance with the timing requirements found in Section 14.16A.230. The response shall:

(1)    Be written;

(2)    State whether the City currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the City to consider a DS; and

(3)    State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

(d)    The City should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

(e)    When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the City shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal.

(1)    If the City indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the City shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

(2)    If the City indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the City shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

(3)    The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent stormwater runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

(4)    Mitigation measures, which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS, may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

(f)    A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period in conformance with the timing requirements found in Section 14.16A.230.

(g)    The City shall deem mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS conditions of approval of the permit decision and enforce them in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit.

(h)    The City’s written response, under subsection (c) of this section is not a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the City to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 870, Sec. 2 (Exh. 1), 2012)

(b)    City staff, the applicant, or a consultant selected by the City or the applicant shall prepare the DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the City will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the City’s procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.

(c)    The City may require an applicant to provide information the City does not possess, including but not limited to specific investigations and reports, that the responsible official deems necessary to prepare the DEIS and/or FEIS.

(Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.100 Scheduling of Hearing to Contest or Mitigate - Correction Prior to Hearing.

The hearing may be cancelled and the party requesting the hearing need not appear only if, at least two business days prior to the scheduled hearing, the applicable department director determines that the violation has been satisfactorily corrected or abated and the monetary penalty paid in full. Where the scheduled hearing involves a repeat violation as defined in this chapter, the hearing shall not be cancelled unless the new violation has been corrected or abated to the satisfaction of the applicable department director and the monetary penalty and costs for the new violation(s) and any monetary penalty and costs owing for the previous violation(s) have been paid in full. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.110 Contested Hearing - Procedure.

The City and the person or entity to whom the notice of civil violation was issued may participate in the hearing and each party, or its legal representatives, may call witnesses and present evidence and rebuttal, subject to the following:

(a)    The City shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred.

(b)    The parties are responsible for securing the appearance of any witnesses they may wish to call; neither the City nor the Hearing Examiner shall have the burden of securing any witnesses on behalf of the person who is contesting the violation(s) or seeking to mitigate the penalties.

(c)    Because formal rules of evidence shall not apply to any such hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall allow hearsay testimony by the parties and not require proof of chain of custody for evidence that is presented, provided the Hearing Examiner shall determine the weight to be assigned to any evidence presented.

(d)    Any notes, reports, summaries, photographs, or other materials prepared by the parties shall be admitted into evidence if requested; provided, the parties are free to argue the weight that should be assigned by the Hearing Examiner to any evidence submitted. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.120 Contested Hearing - Decision of the Hearing Examiner.

(Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.130 Mitigation Hearing - Procedure.

The Hearing Examiner shall conduct a hearing to mitigate the penalty on a violation when such hearing is properly and timely requested; provided, that in the event a person has requested a hearing to contest a violation and prior to the start of the hearing indicates to the Hearing Examiner a desire to mitigate rather than contest, the Examiner shall permit the person to seek mitigation of the monetary penalty. The mitigation hearing shall be conducted according to the following general procedures:

(a)    The person responsible for the violation shall, as a condition of proceeding with the mitigation hearing, agree that he or she has committed the violations as set forth in the notice of the violation. The City shall be relieved of any burden of proving that the violations were committed, and such agreement by the person responsible for the violations shall be sufficient basis for the Hearing Examiner to find the violations committed.

(b)    If the person who has requested the mitigation hearing decides at the time of the hearing that he or she wishes to contest all or some of the alleged violations, the matters wishing to be contested shall, at the request of the City, be rescheduled.

(c)    The person responsible for the violations shall be given the opportunity to explain or provide evidence regarding the nature of the violations, why the violations exist, why the violations have not been abated or corrected, and any other information the Hearing Examiner determines is relevant.

(d)    The City shall be given the opportunity, at its discretion, to provide evidence of the nature of the violation, evidence to rebut assertions made by any party, and any other information or evidence the Hearing Examiner deems is relevant.

(e)    At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding the violations committed pursuant to Section 17.20.140, and shall assess a monetary penalty in accordance with Section 17.20.160. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.140 Mitigation Hearing - Decision of the Hearing Examiner.

(a)    Order to Be Issued at Close of Hearing. Upon the conclusion of a penalty mitigation hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall issue, at that time, a written decision and order using a standard form that contains the following findings and conclusions based on the record:

(1)    For each alleged violation of the City code, a statement indicating whether that violation has been found committed;

(2)    For violations found committed, the monetary penalties and costs being assessed pursuant to this chapter and other applicable provisions of the Lake Stevens Municipal Code;

(3)    For violations found committed, any required corrective actions and a timeline for such corrective actions;

(4)    A statement notifying the person responsible for the violation that he or she is subject to additional civil and/or criminal penalties if any violation that was the subject of the hearing has not been corrected or abated in accordance with Hearing Examiner’s order and applicable provisions of the Lake Stevens Municipal Code;

(b)    Notice of Decision. The City shall provide a copy of the decision and order to the parties at the close of the mitigation hearing. When the City, for good cause shown, requires more time to prepare a written order, or when a party fails to appear after requesting a hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall cause a copy of the decision and order to be served on the parties by mailing a copy to the last known addresses of the parties within 10 business days of the hearing. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.150 Failure to Appear - Default Order.

If the person who requests a hearing to contest a violation or mitigate the penalty then fails to appear at the scheduled hearing after having been given notice in the manner provided for by this chapter, the Hearing Examiner shall use a standard form to immediately issue a default order, which finds committed all the violations set forth in the notice of violation and which assesses a penalty in the full amount indicated in the notice of violation. In addition, at the request of the City, the Hearing Examiner shall also impose upon the non-appearing party any costs to the City related to preparation for the hearing as allowed by law. The Hearing Examiner shall cause a copy of the decision to be served upon the non-appearing party by mailing a copy to the last known address of the non-appearing party within 10 business days of the hearing. Upon the motion of a party, the Hearing Examiner may rescind a default judgment only upon a showing of good cause to do so and only if such motion has been brought within 30 calendar days of the date of the hearing at which the default judgment was ordered. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.160 Monetary Penalty.

(a)    Monetary Penalty. Each violation of a City code provision deemed committed by the Hearing Examiner is subject to a monetary penalty in an amount of $500.00 unless a different penalty amount for a given violation is expressly authorized or required by a more specific City code provision. Except where the person responsible for the violation has requested mitigation of the monetary penalty in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the Hearing Examiner shall have no authority to reduce the amount of the monetary penalty. Where the person has requested to mitigate the monetary penalty, the Hearing Examiner may reduce the monetary penalty for each violation, but in no case shall the penalty be reduced to an amount less than $100.00 for each violation found committed.

(b)    Payment of Monetary Penalty. Any monetary penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter constitute a personal obligation of the person to whom the notice of civil violation is directed. In addition, the monetary penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter may be assessed against the property that is the subject of the enforcement action. Any monetary penalty assessed must be paid in full to the City within 30 days from the date of service of an uncontested notice of violation or any order of the Hearing Examiner that assesses monetary penalties.

(c)    Continuing Duty to Abate Violations. Payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve the person responsible for the violation of the duty to correct or abate the violation. Additional notices of violation may be issued and/or criminal charges filed for continuing failure to correct or abate a violation. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.170 Appeal.

An appeal of the decision of the Hearing Examiner must be filed with the Snohomish County Superior Court within 21 calendar days of service of the decision, which shall be the exclusive means to appeal a decision of the Hearing Examiner rendered under this chapter. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.180 Repeat Violation or Failure to Abate.

Where a person or entity has been found to have committed a violation under this chapter, regardless of whether the violation was resolved without penalty, the failure to abate the violation, or the commission of a subsequent violation, or the violation of a written order of the Hearing Examiner after having received notice of the order as provided in this chapter, shall each constitute a repeat violation and shall each be subject to the penalties and provisions of Section 17.20.015. The City Attorney or designee shall, at his or her discretion, have authority to file a repeat violation as a civil violation with all filing fees and costs of the hearing(s) to be the responsibility of the party responsible for the violation. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.190 Abatement by the City.

(a)    Other Abatement Proceedings Not Precluded. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the City from pursuing abatement of a violation pursuant to any other laws of the state of Washington or the City of Lake Stevens.

(b)    Urgent Abatement. Whenever a condition, the continued existence of which constitutes an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, exists, the City may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. No right of action shall lie against the City or its agents, officers, or employees for actions reasonably taken to prevent or cure any such immediate threats, but neither shall the City be entitled to recover any costs incurred for summary abatement, prior to the time that actual notice of same is provided to the person responsible for the violation.

(c)    Judicial Abatement. The City may seek judicial process, as it deems necessary to abate a condition which was caused by or continues to be a violation of the Lake Stevens Municipal Code and other method of remedial action fails to produce compliance. An order of abatement is issued through the appropriate court of jurisdiction.

(d)    Costs of Abatement. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the costs of any abatement action taken by the City shall become a charge to the person responsible for the violation. These charges may be assessed against the person responsible for the violation or the property upon which the violation occurred, or both. The City may use any lawful means to collect these charges. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.200 Collection of Penalties and Costs.

(a)    Collection of Monetary Penalty. The monetary penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a personal obligation of the person to whom the notice of civil violation is directed or the person responsible for the violation. In addition, the monetary penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter may be assessed against the property that is the subject of the enforcement action. Any monetary penalty assessed must be paid to the City within 10 calendar days from the date of mailing of the Hearing Examiner’s decision or a notice from the City that penalties are due. The City Attorney or designee is authorized to take legal action to collect the monetary penalty.

(b)    Use of Collection Agency. Pursuant to Chapter 19.16 RCW, as currently enacted or hereafter amended, the City may, at its discretion, use a collection agency for the purposes of collecting penalties and costs assessed pursuant to this chapter. The collection agency may add fees or interest charges to the original amount assigned to collections as allowed by law. No debt may be assigned to a collection agency until at least 30 calendar days have elapsed from the time that the City attempts to notify the person responsible for the debt of the existence of the debt and that the debt may be assigned to a collection agency for collection if the debt is not paid. Notice of potential assignment to collections shall be made by certified mail - return receipt requested and first class mail to the last known address of the person responsible for the violation; provided, inability to ascertain a current mailing address shall not prohibit the debt from being assigned to collections.

(c)    Costs of Abatement as Personal Obligation. The costs of any abatement action taken by the City shall become a charge to the person responsible for the violation. These charges may be assessed against the person responsible for the violation or the property upon which the violation occurred. The City may use any lawful means to collect charges.

(d)    Lien Authorized for Abatement. The City of Lake Stevens shall have a lien for any monetary penalty imposed, to the extent allowed by law, the cost of any abatement proceedings under this chapter, and all other related costs, including attorney and expert witness fees, against the real property on which the monetary penalty was imposed or any of the work of abatement was performed. Such costs shall be forwarded by the applicable department director to the Finance Director, who shall certify them to the County Treasurer for assessment on the tax rolls, and to the City Attorney, who shall file a lien for such costs against the real property. The lien shall be subordinate to all previously existing special assessment liens imposed on the same property and shall be superior to all other liens, except for state and county taxes, with which it shall be on parity.

(e)    Contests of Abatement Costs. Any challenge to the amount of the abatement costs shall be heard by the Hearing Examiner in an informal hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall then make a written determination as to whether or not the City’s costs were accurate and necessary for accomplishing the abatement. If the costs are confirmed, then they shall be subject to collection as set forth in this section. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.210 Additional Enforcement Procedures.

The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and may be used in addition to other enforcement and penalty provisions authorized by the Lake Stevens Municipal Code or any other law. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.220 Conflicting Code Provisions.

In the event a conflict exists between the enforcement provisions of this chapter and the enforcement provisions of any international or uniform code, statute, or regulation that is adopted in the Lake Stevens Municipal Code and subject to the enforcement provisions of this chapter, the enforcement provisions of this chapter will prevail, unless the enforcement provisions of this chapter are preempted or specifically modified by said code, statute, or regulation. (Ord. 891, Sec. 7, 2013)


17.20.230 Duty Not Creating Liability.
