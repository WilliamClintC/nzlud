a. Applications for building, demolition or sign permits pertaining to building or demolition shall
be forwarded by the building inspection department to the historic preservation commission
prior to their issuance;
b. A permit applicant, in order to obtain a permit from the building inspection division, shall file a
request for a certificate of appropriateness with the historic preservation commission on a form
furnished by that commission;
c. At its next scheduled meeting, the historic preservation commission shall review the
application and proposed work for compliance with the standards for rehabilitation, hereafter
referred to as the "standards", and any design guidelines adopted by the historic preservation
commission and city council;
(1) Applicants whose proposed projects comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be
issued a "certificate of historic appropriateness" within ten (10) days, which authorizes the
issuance of the appropriate permit;
(2) Applicants whose proposed projects are found to be in noncompliance with this chapter
shall be offered a negotiating period of sixty (60) days, during which time the commission
and applicant shall explore all options for an acceptable solution. These may include the
feasibility of modifying the plans, using the historic landmark for alternative purposes, and
reselling the property to another party. The commission may extend the negotiating period
an additional sixty (60) days for the purposes described above if deemed necessary to
accommodate a potential solution;

(3) If no solution has been agreed upon at the conclusion of either the initial sixty (60) day
period or the full one hundred twenty (120) day period, the certificate of historic
appropriateness will be denied; consequently, the building official shall not issue any
permits;
d. The historic preservation commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness for
rehabilitation or demolition of a landmark property if the owner has presented substantial
evidence demonstrating that unreasonable economic hardship will result from denial of the
certificate of appropriateness:
(1) In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic hardship, the historic preservation
commission may require the owner to provide information to whether the property is capable
of producing a reasonable return for the owner;
(2) Demonstration of economic hardship by the owner shall not be based on conditions
resulting from willful or negligent acts by the owner, purchasing the property for substantially
more than market value at the time of purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and
repairs, failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant
improvements;
5. Appeal: An applicant who has been denied any permit by the building official, based on the
historic preservation commission's refusal to issue a certificate of historic appropriateness, may
appeal that decision to the city council. The appeal must be made on or before thirty (30) days
after the commission's decision.
E. Removal Of Properties From Historic Landmark Register: Properties which, in the opinion of the
historic preservation commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility may be removed from
the historic landmark register after review and consideration by the historic preservation
commission.
F. Enforcement: The provisions of this section are subject to the enforcement provisions established in
the building code, code for building conservation, or in the housing code as adopted by the city.
(Ord. 2002-003, 2002)
2.66.060: STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION AND DESIGN GUIDELINES:
The following standards and guidelines shall be used by the historic preservation commission in
determining the historic appropriateness of any application pertaining to historic landmark properties.
This includes individually designated landmark properties and both contributing and noncontributing
properties in landmark designated historic districts. In approving an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the historic preservation commission shall find that the project substantially complies
will all of the following standards and guidelines that pertain to the application and that the decision is
in the best interest of the city:
A. Standards For Rehabilitation: These standards are based on the secretary of the interior's
standards for rehabilitation, which serve as a national and state model for appropriate preservation
treatment. The standards are as follows:
1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment;
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 40/407
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or
architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken;
4. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their
own right shall be retained and preserved;
5. Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a property shall be preserved;
6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in
design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence;
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using
the gentlest means possible;
8. Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If
such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;
9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and
shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment;
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.
B. General Design Guidelines; Landmark Buildings And Contributing Buildings In Landmark
Designated Historic Districts:
1. Avoid demolition of landmark and contributing buildings. They are a finite resource and cannot
be replaced;
2. Vacant buildings should be weather and vandal proofed in order to minimize further deterioration
and the threat to public safety;
3. Rehabilitation work, especially on the exterior and the principal facade, should preserve existing
historic features or replace them if absolutely necessary with features and materials known to
have existed on the building. Avoid dressing up buildings by adding features based on
speculation;
4. Avoid moving buildings whenever possible, especially to create artificial groupings of historic
buildings. If buildings must be moved, the new site should be similar to the original site, and the
original setback and orientation of the building on the lot should be replicated.
C. Additions To Landmark And Contributing Buildings And Construction Of New Buildings Within
Historic District:
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 41/407
1. New additions to landmark and contributing buildings should be subordinate to the original
building, lower in height, attached to the rear or set back along the side, and subordinate in scale
and architectural detailing;
2. Height, width, setback, roof shape and the overall scale and massing of new buildings should be
compatible with surrounding historic buildings and the overall streetscape;
3. Materials on at least the primary facade should be similar to original materials on facades of
surrounding historic buildings (usually brick, stucco, stone or wood siding, depending on the
specific characteristics of the district);
4. Architectural details (including wood or metal trim, porches, cornices, arches, window and door
features, etc.) should not replicate historic features on surrounding historic buildings;
5. Window and door openings should be similar in size and orientation (vertical or horizontal) to
openings on historic buildings and should take up about the same percentage of the overall
facade as those on surrounding historic buildings;
6. The relationship of the width to the height of the principal elevations shall be in scale with
surrounding structures and streetscape. Wider new buildings can be divided into segments that
more closely resemble the facade widths of historic buildings;
7. The roof shape of a building shall be visually compatible with the surrounding structures and
streetscape. Unusual roof shapes, pitches and colors are discouraged. (Ord. 2002-003, 2002)

determined upon by the city council after the opening of bids, and after publication of notice to
contractors at least one time in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least fifteen
(15) days before the date specified in the notice for the receipt of bids. Such notice may be

rates in accordance with the character, width or extent of the improvement upon that portion of the
street immediately abutting or adjacent to the property.
C. There may be included in any contract for work in such district any one or more of the
improvements provided for in this chapter. Where assessment is levied for the cost of opening,
widening or extending streets or alleys, the purchase or condemnation price of the land shall be
deemed the contract price, and notice to contractors may be dispensed with.
D. The city council may, from time to time as work proceeds in any improvement district pursuant to
contract duly entered into, issue to the contractor interim warrants against the improvement district
for not to exceed ninety percent (90%) in value of the work theretofore done upon estimates of the
city engineer, which warrants shall bear interest at not to exceed six percent (6%) per year from
date of issue until fifteen (15) days after levy of assessment. The interest accruing on such
warrants shall be included in the cost of the improvement.

payment of assessments, or from any or all of such sources. (Prior code § 3-1-6)
3.20.070: BASIS OF ASSESSMENT; PAYMENTS AND DELINQUENT PAYMENTS:
A. The assessment of special taxes for special improvements shall be made as follows: That part of
the cost of engineering, inspection, publishing and mailing notice, making the tax levy, and any
incidental costs upon any such improvement above ten percent (10%) of the contract price of such
improvement shall be paid out of the general funds of the city. The total cost of the improvement,
which shall include the cost of acquisition of any real property involved, the interest on interim
warrants and the total contract price, plus an amount equal to but not exceeding ten percent (10%)
thereof to cover the actual cost of engineering, inspection, publishing and mailing notice and
making the levy, shall be levied at one time upon the property, and shall become due in not more
than ten (10) equal annual installments, as may be provided in the ordinance levying the tax, with
interest on the whole sum unpaid at not to exceed seven percent (7%) per year until due, and
thereafter at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year until paid, payable semiannually or annually, as
provided in the ordinance; provided, that where the assessment is for light service or park
maintenance, interest shall be charged only from and after the due date of each installment, which
date for the first installment shall be fifteen (15) days after the date on which the levy becomes
effective. One or more of such installments, in the order payable, or the whole tax, may be paid
without interest within fifteen (15) days after such ordinance becomes effective.
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 82/407
B. All sums so collected shall be paid to the contractor having the contract to make the improvement,
to pay for which such tax is levied or the cost of the acquisition of any real property involved, or to
pay interim warrants, or for both such purposes, less not exceeding ten percent (10%) to be
retained by the city on account of levying, engineering, inspecting, publishing notices, and other
expenses by the city incident to such improvement and the levy and collection of such tax.
C. All unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may (but only in their
entirety) be paid prior to the dates on which they become due, but any such prepayment must
include an additional amount equal to the interest which would accrue on the assessment to the
next succeeding date on which interest is payable on the warrants or bonds issued in anticipation
of the collection of the assessments, plus such additional amount as, in the opinion of the city
council or of any officer of the city designated by the city council, is necessary to assure the
availability of money to pay interest on the warrants or bonds as interest becomes due and any
premiums which may become payable on redeemable warrants or bonds which may be called in
order to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance.
D. Default in the payment of any such installment of principal or interest when due shall cause the
whole of the unpaid principal or interest to become due and payable immediately, and the whole
amount of the unpaid principal shall thereafter draw interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per
year until paid; but at any time prior to the date of sale or foreclosure, the owner may pay the
amount of all unpaid installments past due, with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year to
date of payment on the delinquent installments, and all accrued costs, and shall thereupon be
restored to the right thereafter to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not
occurred.
E. In case any such tax becomes or has become delinquent, and the property subject thereto has
been or shall be sold to the city therefor, no redemption of such property shall be permitted except
upon payment of the full amount due, interest and taxes paid by the city, and accrued costs and
redemption fees, unless in the judgment of the city council the interest of the city will be subserved
by accepting a less sum in settlement therefor.
F. After sale, if tax sale certificates thereon have issued to the city, the city may provide by ordinance
for payment in installments of unpaid principal, interest and all costs and charges, and for giving
credit for the amount so paid against the amounts so due; provided, that the installment shall be in
such amount as will discharge the indebtedness within not more than the period in which the right
to redeem from such tax sale shall expire.
G. Credit shall be given for each installment as paid, and interest thereby reduced proportionally, and
on all unpaid installments interest shall be paid and charged at the rate of ten percent (10%) per
year.
H. In case any owner electing to take advantage of the provisions of such ordinance fails to make
payment of such installments when due, the right of the city to receive a tax deed for such real
estate shall not be impaired, nor shall the owner be entitled to receive any refund of any amounts
so paid. Such ordinance may also provide for the payment with each installment of a sum, not
exceeding one dollar ($1.00) per installment, to cover the additional bookkeeping expense incurred
in connection therewith, and not to be credited against the delinquent tax.

CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING OF PRIVATE REAL
PROPERTY
3.34.010: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS:
There is an underlying policy in the city, strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving
constitutional taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view
of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same time,
the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the
public's right to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the constitution must be
honored. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of
actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist
governments in considering decisions that may involve constitutional takings. It is intended that a
procedure for such a review be provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is
further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a
specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of
the city to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other duties and functions. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)
3.34.020: CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING DEFINED:
As used in this chapter:
A. "Constitutional taking" means actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of private
real property that might require compensations to a private real property owner because of:
1. The fifth or fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States; or
2. Article I, section 22, of the Utah constitution; or
3. Any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of private real property by a
governmental entity.
B. Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property is not a
"constitutional taking" if the physical taking or exaction bears an essential nexus to a legitimate
governmental interest and, is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an individualized
property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development of the
legitimate government interest. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)

constitutional taking. The reviewing body or person shall not be required to make any determination
under this chapter except pursuant to section 3.34.040 of this chapter. (Ord. 94-003, 1994)
3.34.040: REVIEW OF DECISION:

real property shall request a review of a final decision of any officer, employee, board, commission or
council. The following are specific procedures established for such a review:
A. The person requesting a review must have obtained a final and authoritative determination,
internally, within the city, relative to the decision from which he/she is requesting review.
B. Within thirty (30) days from the date of the final decision that gave rise to the concern that a
constitutional taking has occurred, the person requesting the review shall file in writing, in the office
of the city recorder, a request for review of that decision. A copy shall also be filed with the city
attorney.
C. The city council, or an individual, or body designed by the city council, shall immediately set a time
to review the decision that gave rise to the constitutional takings claim.
D. In addition to the written request for review, the applicant must submit, prior to the date of the
review, the following:
1. Names of the applicant requesting review;

9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 139/407
B. Notice; Updates: The state or designated database provider that provides or maintains an

C. User Held Harmless: A home service provider using the data contained in an electronic database
described above shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would
be due solely as a result of any error or omission in such database provided by the city or a
designated database provider. The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such
database during a calendar quarter, not later than thirty (30) days after the end of such calendar
quarter the state has issued notice of the availability of an electronic database reflecting such
changes under subsection B of this section.
D. Procedure If No Electronic Database Provided:
1. Safe Harbor: If neither the state nor the designated database provider provides an electronic
database, a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in
the city that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an
incorrect taxing jurisdiction, if the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to
assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence to ensure
that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip
code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider
must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the
activity for such enhanced zip code. Any enhanced zip code assignment changed is deemed to
be in compliance with this section. For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable
presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if the home service
provider demonstrates that it has:
a. Expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed
electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;
b. Implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments
of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions; and
c. Used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations,
incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that
materially affect the accuracy of such database.
2. Termination Of Safe Harbor: Subsection D1 of this section applies to a home service provider
that is in compliance with the requirements of subsection D1 of this section with respect to a
state for which an electronic database is not provided, until the later of:
a. Eighteen (18) months after the nationwide standard numeric code has been approved by the
federation of tax administrators and the multistate tax commission; or
b. Six (6) months after the state or a designated database provider in the state provides such
database. (Ord. 2000-011, 2000)

Article I. Declaration Of Findings And Intent; Scope Of
Chapter
5.36.010: DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT:
A. Findings Regarding Rights Of Way: The city finds that the rights of way within the city:
1. Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of
the city;
2. Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;
3. Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering
utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and
general economic well being of the city and its citizens; and
4. Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the
efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the
inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction,
placement, relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
B. Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the city should receive fair and reasonable
compensation for use of the rights of way.
C. Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while telecommunications systems are in part
an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights of way, municipal
franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
D. Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city finds that it is in the best
interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications
services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to the community and public interest, and to

franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
1. Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory
basis as provided herein;
2. Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use
the rights of way to serve the public;
3. Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may flow from such
commercial use of rights of way;
4. Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of the city, in a manner
consistent with federal and state law;
5. Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the city infrastructure;
6. Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of way; and
7. Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such
franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
telecommunication services, within the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act").
F. Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts the telecommunications ordinance codified

Article III. Franchise Required
5.36.050: NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE:
The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation,
construction and maintenance of systems in the city rights of way, in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the city
and provider. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.060: EVERY PROVIDER MUST OBTAIN:
Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of
competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the rights
of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or
providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be
subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of
competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems
may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need of an operator of a cable system to
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same
system, the operator must also obtain a telecommunications franchise. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.070: NATURE OF GRANT:

occupy rights of way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated
in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or subleased. A franchise does not excuse
a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
system on the property of others, including the city's property. This section shall not be construed to
prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a
franchise. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)

course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not
granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of section 5.36.460 of this chapter. (Ord. 2000-
004, 2000)
5.36.090: NATURE OF FRANCHISE:
The franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive
franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on,
over and under the rights of way in order to provide services. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.100: REGULATORY APPROVAL NEEDED:

delinquent state taxes. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.180: NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION:
No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 148/407

claim the city may have for additional sums payable. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.190: NOT IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES OR FEES:
The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically

franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and the
franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the
period of such continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any,
available to the city as a result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to,
damages and restitution. (Ord. 2000-004, 2000)
5.36.210: COSTS OF PUBLICATION:

court for a review of said order, the officer shall cause the dog to be destroyed in a humane
manner.

appealed, or of the mayor and/or chief of police after appeal, shall constitute a class B
misdemeanor.

attached to the affidavit for search warrant so as to afford the magistrate the opportunity to
examine this material.
B. Upon the filing of an affidavit for a search warrant, the magistrate shall determine, by examination
of the material sought to be seized, if attached, by examination of the affidavit describing the
material, or by such other manner or means that he deems necessary, whether probable cause
exists for the immediate issuance of a search warrant. Upon making this determination, he shall
issue a search warrant ordering the seizure of the material described in the affidavit for a search
warrant according to the provisions of the Utah rules of criminal procedure.
C. In the event that a search warrant is issued and material alleged to be pornographic is seized under

(10) days after the date of the seizure, alleging that the material is not pornographic.
D. The magistrate shall set a hearing within seven (7) days after the filing of this notice, or at such
other time as the claimant might agree. At this hearing, evidence may be presented as to whether
there is probable cause to believe the material seized is pornographic, and at the conclusion of the
hearing, the magistrate shall make a further determination of whether probable cause exists to
believe that the material is pornographic. A decision as to whether there is probable cause to
believe the seized material is pornographic shall be rendered by the court within two (2) days after

is available to him, the court shall allow the film to be copied at the claimant's expense pending the

shall be restored unless it is subject to confiscation as contraband, in which case it shall not be

against which the summons is sought is pornographic, which finding shall be made upon affidavit
describing with specificity the material alleged to be pornographic or in such other manner or means
the magistrate deems necessary. Where practical, the material alleged to be pornographic shall be
attached to the affidavit so as to afford the magistrate the opportunity to examine this material. The
summons must be served upon the corporation by delivery of it to an officer, director, managing or
general agent, or cashier or the assistant cashier thereof. The production of material alleged to be

tests taken at the direction of a peace officer, nor preclude nor delay the test or tests to be taken at the
direction of a peace officer. Such additional test shall be subsequent to the test or tests administered

celebrations, etc.
C. Tree Districts: Districts may be formed to facilitate specialized tree plantings and formation of
management areas that address a beautification theme or similar effect. The trees may be under
one ownership, regardless of property boundaries or frontage. Areas where districts may be
formed include, but are not limited to, Main Street, city entryways, gardens, parks or cemeteries.
D. Tree Forestry: The city may organize and budget for a forestry crew with personnel, equipment,
training, supplies and materials. Contract labor and equipment may also be used.

unless designated otherwise. Existing trees within the public rights of way shall be under the
ownership and management of the adjacent and abutting property owner(s).
G. Tree Varieties: Only those tree varieties authorized by the city shall be planted within the public
rights of way. Acceptable trees are those whose roots, trunks, and branches will not encroach
upon adjacent improvements such as curbs, gutters, sidewalks, pipes, wires, streetlights, fire
hydrants, utilities, etc., and will not impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Only fruitless tree
varieties should be planted. A list of trees that may be planted in the public rights of way and a list
of trees that are prohibited are listed below.

Mulberry (fruitless variety)
Purple leaf plum (fruitless variety)
Note: Trees are not to be planted in parkways that are less than five feet (5') in width, to
avoid conflict with utilities (above or under ground) and/or obstruct sight distance.
TREES NOT RECOMMENDED
It is recommended that the following trees not be planted anywhere within Price City limits:
Box elder
Undesirable as an ornamental. Often becomes nearly completely defoliated in early
summer by the box elder leaf roller.
Box elder bugs can be a nuisance where female trees are found (they feed on the fruit).
Weak wooded and have poor branch structure. Difficult to prune and remove.
Trees get very large and require large amount of moist deep soil and area.
Chinese elm
Has many undesirable features and should not be planted in most cases.
Weak wood. Difficult to prune and remove.
Diseases and insects cause problems for this species.
Cottonwood
Weak wooded and have poor branch structure. Trees grow very large and are dangerous
to people and property. Difficult to prune and remove.
Requires large amounts of water.
The cotton like material that the tree produces becomes a large nuisance to all
surrounding properties.
Globe willow
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 308/407
Weak wood and/or branch structure. Susceptibility to slime flux and other disease and
insect problems. Overwhelming branch and canopy. Uproots sidewalks. Difficult to prune
and remove.
Prefers abundant water. Rarely should be planted.
Dropping limbs and branches are extremely obnoxious. The grass below the tree often
dies away.
Russian olive
This tree is very aggressive, weedy, drops many seeds, has thorns, and has been
declared a noxious weed in Carbon, Duchesne, and Uintah Counties in Utah. It has
caused some serious environmental degradation and should not be planted.
Tamarisk
This shrubby tree is a pest and should not be planted because of its weedy
characteristics.
Drops a lot of seeds that flourish and overtake the surrounding area.
H. Location Of Trees: Trees may be planted in the street parkway. The parkway is the space between
the street back of curb and front edge of sidewalk. Trees should not be planted in parkways that
are less than five feet (5') wide.
I. Spacing: Trees shall be planted so that they do not create a hedge or obscure adequate sight
distance important to pedestrians and vehicular traffic. On a street corner no trees shall be planted
within a forty foot by forty foot (40' x 40') triangle, from the intersecting property lines, in order to
provide adequate corner sight distance.
J. Planting: A hole of sufficient width and depth shall be excavated to allow adequate room for tree
roots. Following placement of the new tree, the hole should be backfilled with the excavated and/or
other suitable material that will encourage adequate growth of the tree. Generally accepted tree
planting procedures should be followed and Blue Stakes should always be called before digging.
K. Care: Once a tree is planted then it shall be maintained to promote the health of the tree, to prevent
unnecessary encroachment and to ensure public safety. Care shall include watering, fertilizing,
pruning, removal and applying herbicide or pesticides, if needed.
L. Clearances: No part of a tree shall overhang the public right of way such that it blocks pedestrian
passage, vehicle travel, streetlights and adequate sight distance. Trees shall not be planted closer
to: a driveway or alley than ten feet (10'), a fire hydrant than five feet (5') and a stop sign than thirty
feet (30'). Avoid planting in front of any sign. In all cases measure from the center of the tree trunk.
Be aware of what size the full grown tree trunk diameter will be.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 309/407
M. Growth: Tree growth shall be managed to enable a tree to reach its intended size and shape. The
height, trunk, limbs, roots, width and spread should be monitored to prevent: obscuring sight
distance, blocking pedestrian and vehicle passage, covering streetlight illumination or damage to
utilities and improvements. Seasonal cleanup of leaves, limbs, seeds, fruit droppings and other
debris associated with trees within the public rights of way shall be the responsibility of the
adjacent and abutting property owners.
N. Pruning: Trees shall be pruned to remove: overgrowth, diseased, dead, decayed or broken limbs,
parts of the tree causing a problem with utilities, tree limbs obstructing sight distance or inhibiting
pedestrian and vehicle movement or otherwise creating an unsafe condition. Tree limbs shall not
obstruct a clear space of eight feet (8') over sidewalks or thirteen feet (13') over streets. Trees with
multiple trunks shall be pruned to prevent bush like growth. The spoils from tree pruning shall not
be left in the public right of way, but shall be removed and disposed of properly in a timely way.
Weather related tree damage shall be removed.
O. Removal: Should a tree create a problem that cannot be resolved by pruning or other tree care
methods, then it is to be removed. Removal shall include bringing the entire tree down to the
ground. The stump shall be removed by excavating and/or grinding. If necessary, the tree shall be
treated before removal to prevent growth from the stump or spread of roots. When removing a
tree, the area around the tree impacted by falling branches, shall be secured including placement
of traffic control as needed. The spoils of the tree removal shall be removed from the public rights
of way and disposed of properly in a timely way. Blue Stakes should always be called before
digging.
P. Safety: Safety precautions should be implemented when climbing, cutting, pruning or removing a
tree. No one should ever attempt to work in or around a tree that has grown into surface,
underground or overhead utilities.
Q. Abuse; Mutilation Or Vandalism Of Trees: No person shall intentionally, maliciously or neglectfully
damage, cut, scalp, break, hit, treat, carve, burn, nail into, bind with wire, etc., any tree.
R. Notification: Blue Stakes should always be contacted prior to digging and the city should be alerted
if tree limbs extend into overhead wires (power, telephone, cable, etc.).
S. Emergency: The city shall have the right to prune or remove a tree that poses an immediate danger
to property, pedestrians, or vehicular traffic. The city shall make a reasonable effort to notify the
adjacent property owner and/or tree owner prior to commencement of pruning or tree removal.
T. Private Property: On private property small or medium size trees shall not be planted any closer to
the sidewalk than five feet (5') and large trees shall not be planted any closer to the sidewalk than
ten feet (10'). Trees should not be planted such that they interfere with overhead, surface or
underground utilities, nor pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Removal or the avoidance of planting trees
considered undesirable, noxious or a nuisance is encouraged. (Res. 2011-04, 2011)

BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY: An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow.
Specifications for backflow prevention assemblies are contained within the Utah plumbing code,
chapter 10 (appendix J), and the cross connection control program for Utah.
CONTAMINATION: A degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by sewage, industrial
fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures which may allow
nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other material of questionable quality to come in contact with
potable water inside a distribution system. This would include any temporary connections, such as
swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel
or changeover devices or sliding multiport tubes, or other plumbing arrangements.
CROSS CONNECTION CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved backflow assembly at the
water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically
infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections within
the customer's water system; or, the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the
service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or
potential cross connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the
cross connection (isolation).
CROSS CONNECTION, CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system and a
nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and
maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.
WATER PURVEYOR: The person designated to be in charge of the water department of Price City, is
vested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross connection
control program, and for the enforcement of the provisions of this article. (Ord. 90-009, 1990)
13.04.300: POLICY:
A. Protection Required:
1. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the public water
purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by the state laws, regulations, codes
and this article. Service of water to a consumer found to be in violation of this article shall be
discontinued by the water purveyor after due process of written notification and an appropriate
time suspense for voluntary compliance, if:
a. A backflow prevention assembly required by this article for control of backflow and cross
connection is not installed, tested and maintained; or
b. If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or bypassed; or
c. If an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises; or
d. If the periodic system survey has not been conducted.
2. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 319/407
B. Inspections: The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to
authorized representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether cross connections or other
structural or sanitary hazards, including violation of this article, exist and to audit the results of the
required survey, as provided in subsection 13.04.250B of this article.
C. Assembly Required: Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service connection's water
usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow prevention
assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified consumer's water system, at or near
the property line, or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first
branch line leading off the service line.
D. Type Of Assembly: The type of protective assembly required under subsection C of this section
shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists at the point of cross connection (whether
direct or indirect), applicable to local and state requirements or resulting from the required survey.
E. Presently Installed Assemblies: All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not
meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purposes described
herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the
inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection F of this section, be excluded from the
requirements of these rules so long as the water purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily
protect the public water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present
location or requires more than minimum maintenance or, when the water purveyor finds that the
operation or maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be
replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the local and state requirements.
F. Maintenance, Testing: It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where backflow
prevention assemblies are installed to have certified surveys/inspections, and operational tests
made at least once per year at the consumer's expense. In those instances where the public water
purveyor deems the hazard to be great, he may require certified surveys/inspections and tests at a
more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the public water purveyor to see that these tests are
made according to the standards set forth by the state department of health, bureau of drinking
water/sanitation.
G. Initial Testing: All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10) working days of
initial installation.
H. Safety Hazard Prohibited: No backflow prevention assembly shall be installed so as to create a
safety hazard. Example: Installed over an electrical panel, steam pipes, boilers, pits or above
ceiling level. (Ord. 90-009, 1990)
13.04.310: FAILURE TO CORRECT; PENALTY:
If violations of this article exist or if there has not been any corrective action taken by the consumer
within ten (10) days of the written notification of deficiencies noted within the survey, then the public
water purveyor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical
break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with the state
and city statutes relating to plumbing, safe drinking water supplies and the regulations adopted

Chapter 15.36
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
15.36.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND
METHODS:
A. Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Utah has in Utah Code Annotated 10-3-701
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations assigned to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore the city council of Price City,
Utah, does ordain as follows.
B. Findings Of Fact:
1. Flood hazard areas are those specified by the federal emergency management agency (FEMA)
as they appear in the flood insurance study (FIS) and flood insurance rate maps (FIRM). Said
areas are primarily the 100-year flood boundaries along the Price River, Meads Wash, and
selected tributaries within the city.
2. The flood hazard areas of Price City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which
cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas
by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
C. Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas
by provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 346/407
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
D. Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses:
1. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
d. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)
15.36.020: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give
them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable
application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform
which originates at the apex and is characterized by high velocity flows; active processes of erosion,
sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that
formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an
average depth of one to three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one
percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A
on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in
preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99,
VO, V1-30, VE or V.
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 347/407
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without
which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not
limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations or storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE,
A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in
zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated
floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls
parallel to the floor of the water and b) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity
of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE,
A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill
or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building
otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the
national flood insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before July 12, 1983, for FIRMs
effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets,
and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of
the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the federal
emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency management
agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the

B. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have been
authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify
flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood
hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works
are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,
flood control works and floodplain management regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building
codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading
ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes
such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of
flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water
from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port
facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding
and ship repair facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:

structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance
with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of
section 60.3 of the national flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to
the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December
31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or subdivision
for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
A. Built on a single chassis;
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 350/407

D. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the
coastal barrier resources act (public law 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally
aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of
a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or
B. Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a "historic structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see section 60.6
of the national flood insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate,
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 351/407
other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic vertical datum
(NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in
the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)

existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another
ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the
more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
F. Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
1. Considered as minimum requirements;
2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
G. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be
increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or

to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
6. Variances may be issued for substantial improvements on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection C2 of this section have been fully
considered.
7. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purpose and objectives of this chapter (subsection 15.36.010C of this chapter).
8. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
9. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
10. Prerequisites for granting variances:
a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
b. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) Showing a good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure
will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 355/407
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
11. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements
and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided
that:
a. The criteria outlined in subsections D1 through D9 of this section are met, and
b. The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. (Ord. 2012-003, 2012)
15.36.050: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
A. General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all
new construction and substantial improvements:
1. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
2. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices
that minimize flood damage;
3. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage;
4. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating,

components during conditions of flooding;
5. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
6. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
7. On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding.
B. Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in subsections 15.36.030B and 15.36.040B8 of this chapter, or subsection C3
of this section, the following provisions are required:
1. Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated a minimum of one foot (1')
above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor
shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as
proposed in subsection 15.36.040C1 of this chapter, is satisfied.

(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood level or together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review
structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design
and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
floodplain administrator.
3. Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered

to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
b. Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-
30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 1) outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision, 2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, 3) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or 4) in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result
of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement.
c. Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's
FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection B4 be elevated so that either:
(1) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or
(2) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty six inches (36") in height
above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 357/407
5. Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30,
AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
a. Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days,
b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
c. Meet the permit requirements of subsection 15.36.040C1 of this chapter, and the elevation
and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection B4 of this section. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
C. Standards For Subdivision Proposals:
1. All subdivision proposals within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM including
the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with
subsections 15.36.010B, C and D of this chapter.
2. All proposals for the development of subdivisions within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community's FIRM including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall
meet development permit requirements of subsections 15.36.030C and 15.36.040C of this
chapter and the provisions of this section.

development within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM including the placement
of manufactured home parks and subdivisions greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to subsection 15.36.030B or 15.36.040B8
of this chapter.
4. All subdivision proposals within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM including
the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
5. All subdivision proposals within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM including
the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize
or eliminate flood damage.
D. Standards For Areas Of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones): Located within the areas of special flood
hazard established in subsection 15.36.030B of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow
flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is
specified).
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures:
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 358/407
a. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least
as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no
depth number is specified), or
b. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood
level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
3. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain
administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 15.36.040C1 of this
chapter, are satisfied.
4. Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
E. Floodways: Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection
15.36.030B of this chapter, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and
erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

Chapter 17.10
PRICE CITY GENERAL PLAN
Article I. Introduction
17.10.010: PLAN INTRODUCTION:
The Price City general plan, referred to herein as the "plan", is the official statement of both short and
long range goals and strategies to guide growth and development within the city. The plan focuses on
improving the physical environment of the city as well as the quality of life of the citizens. It is intended
to be an effective working tool employed by the city in making community decisions and achieving
planning goals.
An important companion and reference document to this plan is found in appendix A, "Price City: A
21st Century Community", on file in the city.
A. Plan Update: The process to update the Price City general plan began in September 2003. The city
general plan prior to that time had not been officially adopted or updated for several years. The
task set forth was to, in essence, start from scratch and create a new plan, which could serve as a
foundational plan for the community into future years.
A general plan advisory committee was created to work with the planning consultants, the planning
group at J-U-B Engineers. The committee was made up of various members of the community, as
well as representatives from city staff, the planning commission and the city council. In the scope
of four (4) meetings, the committee was charged with the responsibility to provide feedback and
direction for the establishment of the elements and goals for the new general plan. Meeting with a
group of community stakeholders, the committee participated in several visioning and planning
exercises. Six (6) neighborhood meetings were held in various locations throughout the city to
allow the public an opportunity to provide input into the planning process. Additional public input
was sought and received through the distribution of a survey.
The survey requested input in the following areas: 1) vision for the future; 2) quality of life; 3)
growth in the community; 4) economic development; 5) downtown revitalization; 6)
roadways/transportation; 7) parks and recreation; and 8) comments. Approximately three thousand
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 367/407
eight hundred (3,800) surveys were mailed to Price residents with the city utility billings in
September, with additional copies distributed at city hall.
A total of three hundred twenty five (325) surveys were returned, representing a return rate of eight
and one-half percent (81/2%). The average national rate of return for such surveys is
approximately three percent (3%). In general, survey respondents displayed a feeling that Price is
a good place to live and raise a family. Key issues involving a lot of interest and support by the
respondents include the need for:
1. More job opportunities and expanded economic development;
2. More recreation opportunities and youth activities;
3. A better, cleaner atmosphere and appearance in the city; and
4. Continued emphasis on a city which is a good, friendly, and safe place for children and families.
(For more survey results, see appendix B, "Price City General Plan Survey Results", as referenced
in the ordinance codified herein, on file in the city.)
Following review and revisions, public hearings before the planning commission and city council
were held. The plan, as presented here, was adopted by the Price City council on April 13, 2004.
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.020: MOTTO, MISSION AND VISION:
Listed below are the motto, mission statement and vision statement of the Price City general plan as
developed and recommended by the general plan advisory committee, and as part of the "Price City:
A Utah 21st Century Community" report.
The motto serves as a slogan to paint a picture or send a message in relation to the character of the
community. The mission statement represents the overriding purpose of what the city is and does. The
vision statement reflects the shared image of what people want the city to become at some point in
the future. It is the big picture to guide decisions.
MOTTO
Price, the Heart of Utah's Castle Country1
MISSION STATEMENT
The mission of Price City is to protect and promote the welfare of all citizens by ensuring
exceptional service and leadership through communication, cooperation and creativity.
VISION STATEMENT
Price will be a clean, friendly community that retains its safe, small town feel and charm. The
citizens envision a city that is progressive, unified, rich in heritage and ethnic diversity, with economic
security and responsive government, quality education, healthy environment and good medical
facilities.

9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 368/407
17.10.030: IMPLEMENTATION:
Implementation of the plan comes through working documents, such as the zoning and subdivision
ordinances, capital improvement programs, city budgets, and other ordinances, resolutions and
studies thought appropriate by the city council. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.040: AMENDMENTS:
To preserve the integrity of the plan and to ensure that it reflects the changing needs of residents, it is
city policy that:
A. The plan shall receive a comprehensive review at least once every five (5) years to keep the
policies and programs consistent with changing trends and conditions;
B. All rezones, improvement programs, and ordinance changes concerning development shall be in
harmony with the plan.
The public may request amendments to the plan up to three (3) times during any one calendar year.
The months in which the city council will hold a public hearing to consider the public's requests are:
February, June and October. The applicant must show that any amendment of the plan is in the best
interest of the city, promotes the general welfare of the community, and does not decrease the quality
of life for the citizens of Price. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.050: HISTORY OF PRICE:
Price, the county seat of Carbon County, is the largest city in the county and is located in the Price
River Valley of the Colorado Plateau region of Utah. It is believed that Price was named after LDS
Bishop William Price of Goshen, Utah, who explored the region in 1869. The area was originally a part
of Sanpete County, and then was included in Emery County when it was created in 1880. Price was
organized on July 14, 1892, while it was still a part of Emery County.
Caleb Baldwin Rhoades and Abraham Powell, trappers from Salem, Utah, were the first recorded
settlers in the Price River Valley. They arrived in October 1877 and built a cabin in the northwest
corner of what is now Price. The two (2) returned to Salem when the trapping season was over. Their
talk aroused interest in the area among their friends and families, and they soon convinced a group to
join them in relocating in the Price River Valley. However, Abraham Powell never returned to Price as
he was killed by a bear on December 7, 1878, while hunting in the Nebo Mountains.
On January 21, 1879, Caleb Rhoades returned to the valley with two (2) brothers, Frederick Empire
Grames and Charles W. Grames. The men helped each other build homes for their families. Later that
year, they were joined by their families and others, most coming from Utah County.
These early pioneers of Price experienced much hardship. Food was in short supply, and crops were
difficult to grow because of a lack of irrigation water. Water had to be carried from the river in barrels
and tanks. An irrigation ditch to carry water to the fields was of utmost importance. Construction of two
(2) ditches began in February 1879 when Caleb Rhoades and Frederick Grames began the project. A
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 369/407
community effort eventually finished the two (2) ditches, but it wasn't until the Price Water Company
Canal was finished in 1888 that the irrigation problem was solved. The canal is still in use today.
The character of Price changed dramatically with the completion of the railroad in 1883. Price was
quickly transformed from an isolated farming community to the commercial hub of Castle Valley. The
railroad was directly responsible for Price becoming the retail, political, educational, and cultural
center of the area. The railroad also opened up the nearby coal mines, which brought thousands of
foreign born, non-Mormon immigrants to work the mines. Originally these miners lived in the coal
camps near the mines, but Price gradually assimilated many of them, reflecting the ethnic diversity of
the county and becoming a cultural hub as well. These immigrants came from many countries, but the
majority was Greek, Italian, Austrian and Japanese. This diversified population has remained today,
making Price one of Utah's most culturally complex and varied communities.
Price has a variety of stores and businesses, as well as many parks, recreational facilities, schools,
and a full service hospital. Price is also the home of the College of Eastern Utah, a rapidly growing
community college. Past expansion and future plans for CEU Prehistoric Museum have made it one of
the best of its kind in the world.
The economy of Price is very much tied to the coal industry, and therefore has been through many up
and down cycles; but Price remains today the commercial and cultural center of Castle Valley. Price
has always been and continues to be unique among Utah towns. (Source: Jane Lyman Johnson, Utah
History Encyclopedia) (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.060: DEMOGRAPHICS:
The most recent data available in most demographic categories is found in the results of the census
2000 by the U.S. Census Bureau (see "Exhibit 2, Price Demographics", of this section). Figures from
that census are still a good representation of the Price community, since the community and economic
growth in recent years has been small. Population actually decreased between the 1990 and 2000
census reports by 3.6 percent, from 8,712 to 8,402. Community growth through the year 2030 has
been projected at 0.7 percent per year by the Utah state governor's office of planning and budget. At
this rate, the projected population of Price in the year 2030 will be 11,481.

Article II. Land Use
17.10.070: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the land use element is to demonstrate planning for community quality of life and
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 374/407
economic vitality by: 1) showing general land use classifications; and 2) establishing land use goals
that manage growth. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.080: LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS:
Price City land uses are divided into the categories of residential, commercial, industrial and special
districts (see "General Plan Land Use Map, Exhibit 3", of this section). Each category is divided into
land use classifications, as follows:
A. Residential:
1. Rural Density (Zones Included: RR): The rural density residential (RDR) classification is for
residential uses in areas where a rural atmosphere, open space preservation and agriculture
uses are encouraged. The housing density should not exceed one unit per gross acre.
Exceptions to this maximum density may be permitted as conditional use, subject to the
clustering of housing and provision of meaningful open space.
2. Low Density (Zones Included: SF-12, SF-8): The low density residential (LDR) classification is
for typical low density suburban neighborhoods with single-family homes on individual building
lots. The housing density should not exceed four (4) units per gross acre.
3. Medium Density (Zones Included: SF-6, MR-7): The medium density residential (MDR)
classification is for smaller individual home lots and multiple-family housing units such as
duplexes, townhomes and other types of small scale attached housing units. The housing
density should not exceed seven (7) units per gross acre.
4. High Density (Zones Included: MR-11): The high density residential (HDR) classification is for
multi-family development, such as apartment and condominium complexes, with an overall
housing density in excess of seven (7) units per gross acre.
B. Commercial:
1. Community Commercial (Zones Included: N-C, S-C, GC): The community commercial (CC)
classification is for general shopping facilities to satisfy the shopping needs of the community for
a particular neighborhood. The intensity of the commercial zone applied will depend on such
factors as the nature and location of surrounding uses, the ability to buffer surrounding uses, and
the availability of necessary infrastructure.
2. Highway Commercial (Zones Included: H-C): The highway commercial (HC) classification is for
commercial and service uses serving the needs of thoroughfare traffic and the traveling public in
locations adjacent to highways or major streets.
C. Industrial:
1. Light Industrial (Zones Included: M-D): The light industrial (LI) classification is intended to
provide for clean and less intensive industrial, manufacturing and technological uses. Facilities
and operations to take place within this designation should be designed to protect the
environmental quality of adjacent areas.
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 375/407
2. Heavy Industrial (Zones Included: M-G): The heavy industrial (HI) classification is for a range of
industrial and manufacturing uses, including heavy industry. The intensity of the manufacturing
uses and corresponding zoning will depend on surrounding uses, existing infrastructure and the
ability to buffer and protect adjacent or nearby residential uses.
D. Special Districts:
1. Public Facilities (Zones Included: PF): A special district is established to promote the effective
planning and development of public facilities and mixed land uses.
2. Special Planned Districts (Zones Included: CD, PL): Provision is made for the establishment of
special planned districts, allowing for mixed and special development uses which may vary from
zoning regulations, but which will be a desirable asset to the community.
3. Overlay Districts (Zones Included: SA, DRA): Overlay districts do not fall within a general plan
classification since they are intended to mix additional uses, limitations or designations with
those allowed in the underlying zoning, in various areas throughout the city. Overlay zones are
intended to be applied only when the overlay meets articulated needs of the city.

(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.090: ENVIRONMENT:
Protection of the environment is considered an important part of planning in Price. Development plans
should be sensitive to the environment of the immediate area, as well as the whole community. Those
areas in Price which are considered to be environmentally sensitive include land which: a) is within a
designated 100-year floodplain; b) is subject to geological hazards, unstable soil conditions, slopes in
excess of twenty five percent (25%), or rockfall areas; and c) has a high water table and ground water,
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 376/407
including wetlands, perched water and drainageways.
Areas within Price recognized as having significant concern for environmental protection include the
banks and adjacent lands along the Price River, Meads Wash and associated drainage corridors.
Additionally, there exists concern for the protection and prevention of erosion of Wood Hill and other
hills to the north of the city. These areas require special attention by the city and any potential
developers, to make the protection of the environment an important objective. (See "Environmentally
Sensitive Areas Map, Exhibit 4", of this section.)
A. Hillsides: Development on hillside areas is to be restricted with regard to grading, slope, rockfall,
natural vegetation, drainage, and the provision of city services.
B. Wetlands: Wetlands are widely regarded as a valuable natural resource. The values that wetlands
provide include water filtration/purification, the absorption and breakdown of toxins, the recharging
of ground water, flood control, habitat for wildlife, recreation and education and aesthetics. It is the
objective of Price City to preserve wetland areas where possible. In some cases, however, the best
course of action might be to consider development which will improve and enhance disturbed
wetlands.
Protection of the environment throughout the city also requires continued attention to preserving
and improving air quality, water quality and the planting of trees.
C. Open Space Preservation: Open space preservation is recognized as an important land use and
function of Price City. Several areas within the city are targeted for open space preservation,
including the banks and adjoining land along Price River, Meads Wash, and Price Canal, as well
as Wood Hill. These areas may include open space parks and the development of recreational
trails. Additionally, several areas which fall within designated potential annexation areas include
lands which are best suited to be maintained for open space and recreational purposes.
Private property owners of undeveloped land, who do not desire to develop their properties, are
encouraged to preserve open space through conservation easements, agriculture protection areas,
or other open space preservation methods.

(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.100: ANNEXATION PLANS:
Annexation is a process by which the boundaries are extended to incorporate additional lands into the
city. Residents of a newly annexed area become citizens of the city and share in the benefits and
responsibilities of that citizenship.
Unincorporated areas within one-half (1/2) mile of Price City's current boundaries have been identified
for possible future annexation and their potential land use designations are shown on the Price City
"General Plan Land Use Map, Exhibit 3", of this chapter. The application of the recommended land
uses for those properties which seek annexation will allow for well planned and cohesive growth. The
identification of potential annexation lands and annexation policies are outlined in the Price Municipal
Corporation annexation policy plan, referenced and incorporated into this plan as appendix C on file in
the city. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.110: IMPLEMENTATION:
The zoning and subdivision ordinances, as found in the Price City land development code, shall carry
out the land use element. Other sections of the city code, however, may also carry out parts of this
element.

Article III. Urban Design
17.10.120: INTRODUCTION:
Good urban design can improve the visual and functional relationship between people and their
physical environment. It can create a desirable physical form for community needs and services.
Because urban design overlaps other aspects of planning such as recreation, open space,
transportation, and commercial and residential land uses, this article will focus on objectives towards
the visual design and image of the community. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.130: MAIN STREET AND BUSINESS CORRIDORS:
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 381/407
The character and success of a community is often defined by the urban design and economic vitality
of the downtown area and the business corridors. In Price, the downtown area is generally seen as
those blocks immediately adjoining Main Street between Heritage park (400 West) and 300 East
Street. Within this area are many opportunities for urban design and community improvement,
including the refurbishing/restoration of building facades, and the installation of streetscape elements.
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.140: STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS:
Effectively designed and constructed streetscapes on Price's streets will do much to improve their
look, feel and effectiveness, and thereby have many positive impacts on the economy and quality of
life in Price.
What is a streetscape? It can be defined as a facelift; a beautification or softening of a city street. It is
a development project which invites pedestrian traffic by adding human elements to the harsh
environment of a street designed mostly for the fast flow of vehicles. It provides physical and
designable characteristics that provide the setting for successful urban living. Streetscape designs are
intended to make the community's main street a great street. A street people want to use. A street
which helps define the community.
Several options exist for designing streetscapes on Price's main corridors, which include various
combinations of streetscape elements. Streetscape elements can be divided into two (2) categories:
A. Landscaping and surfaces, including trees, plants, grass, ground cover, rocks, sidewalks and
special surfaces;
B. Street furniture and features, including benches, planter boxes, decorative garbage containers,
drinking fountains, outdoor clocks, bollards, themed signage, monuments, statues, public art,
design lighting standards, banners and special architectural features.
The Price City motto "Price, the Heart of Utah's Castle Country" and a city logo should be visibly
applied to those streetscape elements installed.
Successful streetscape projects would maintain the necessary access and traffic flow for commercial
needs, while also providing physical characteristics that provide the setting for successful urban family
living. Benefits to streetscapes on the busy streets in Price include:
A. Vehicular traffic is calmed as the street feels more like a corridor to move people and not just
vehicles;
B. Investment appeal and quality development expand in a spruced up commercial corridor;
C. Business activity increases in areas previously deemed harsh and unsightly;
D. Increased pedestrian traffic is encouraged in a comfortable environment with shade trees,
benches and water fountains;
E. An increase in property values and community pride;
F. A sense of community core and cohesion is enhanced.
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 382/407
1. Main Street: Main Street is the most important corridor to the community in terms of
economics, historic heritage and community core. The downtown section of Main Street, from
approximately Heritage park at 400 West to 300 East Street, carries special significance to the
community as its core. Special attention to maintaining and upgrading the appearance and
feel of this area is essential to its vitality and effectiveness. This section of Main Street, along
with those cross streets heading north and south for the distance of one block, should be
assigned the highest priority for streetscape improvement projects in Price.
The remaining section of Main Street, between 300 East and the U.S. Highway 6 interchange,
is also very important to the community, especially as a business corridor. Although the
development and design of the built environment varies from that of the downtown area,
attention to the quality of appearance of the streets, sidewalks and landscaping can be equally
beneficial to the community. Streetscaping can take a different form in this area, but certain
elements should tie into the theme of what is used in the downtown section.
2. Other Main Corridors: Carbon Avenue and 100 North Street should be considered second
priority for streetscape improvements. As a third priority, the following streets should be
considered for streetscape improvements: 100 South Street, 300 East Street, 800 North
Street, and Cedar Hills Drive. Finally, improvements should be planned on the streets
surrounding Washington park and the College of Eastern Utah.
The most important areas for improvements on all streets are near major intersections and
freeway entrances.
3. Entryways: Entryway beautification is key to creating a great impression for visitors and
setting the tone for the beautiful and progressive community that Price is and strives even
more to become. Beautification improvement projects at the entryways to the community can
include many types of streetscape features, but usually provide the most effective impact with
landscaping around highway interchanges and welcoming monuments. Entryway areas in
Price for which improvements should be considered include the entrances to U.S. Highway 6
at Westwood Boulevard/100 North Street, Carbon Avenue, and East Main Street/State
Highway 55.
4. Urban Forestry: Trees play a significant role in the beautification and urban design of the
community. The Price City shade tree commission is charged with promoting good urban
forestry in the public rights of way. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.150: HISTORIC PRESERVATION:
Historic buildings and houses add much to the character of a city. There are many sites in Price that
either currently have, or have the potential to be given, an official historic designation. National and
state historic registers consider a structure to be eligible for listing if that structure is at least fifty (50)
years old, has a high degree of physical integrity, meets certain criteria concerning association with
historic events, persons, architectural or archeological significance or construction techniques.
The city's historical commission is involved in the preservation and restoration of structures in the
downtown area, with the goal to restore older buildings to their original appearance. Also, there are
many homes in the community which warrant preservation and possible designation of historic
significance. A long range goal for the city and the historical commission is to inventory, preserve and
protect these significant structures. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.160: OUTDOOR PUBLIC ART:
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 383/407
Outdoor public art, such as statues, art structures and other design features, can benefit a community
in many ways. Well placed and well designed public art can:
A. Create cohesion in the urban design of a community;
B. Provide a sense of community for individual neighborhoods, as well as the community at large;
C. Have a positive impact on the image of the community; and
D. Assist with community historical preservation efforts.
Public art in Price should be placed, where possible and practical, near commercial centers, along
major corridors, in parks, near recreational facilities and at other locations where it can be seen by
many people. Local artists are encouraged to participate in the display of public art.

Article IV. Economics
17.10.170: INTRODUCTION:
Price City is interested in pursuing and maintaining a healthy level of economic growth. Such growth is
a means of providing a balanced, healthy economy in Price. It is a means of expanding our tax base
for better homes, better schools and better public services. It is a means of providing more
employment opportunities.
The city also recognizes the importance of establishing and maintaining an appropriate level of
community sustainability. While total sustainability is not possible, any reduction in the percentage of
imported goods and services strengthens the community's ability to survive both economically and
environmentally. The export of native goods and services to nearby communities, if it does not
denigrate the quality of life and impact the natural environment, will also provide long term benefits to
Price City. Those benefits will be in terms of business opportunities, stable employment and increased
economic well being.
Price acts as a regional center for commercial needs and services in Carbon County and surrounding
areas. Building upon existing opportunities and services becomes important as Price continues to fill
this important role in the region. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.180: DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION:
The revitalization of the core of the community is one of the paramount economic activities of the city.
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 386/407
Downtown Price is currently a functioning and valuable economic area of the city, although it is
generally recognized as needing greater support and improvement. The downtown area brings
together the convergence of the three (3) most important business corridors in Price, which are Main
Street, 100 North Street and Carbon Avenue. Each of these corridors make connection to U.S.
Highway 6, providing the backbone for business opportunities and the economic success of the
community.
Recognizing the importance for a vital and effective downtown, revitalization efforts through
redevelopment and other programs are being shaped by the city and the business community. Several
concepts have been recently introduced which will serve to make downtown Price more viable. They
include:
A. Streetscape improvements (see section 17.10.140 of this chapter);
B. Historic preservation (see section 17.10.150 of this chapter);
C. Redevelopment agency funding and business assistance;
D. Special events held in the downtown area;
E. The attraction of additional retail and commercial services;
F. Potential expansion of the CEU Prehistoric Museum.
The downtown area is currently included in a redevelopment area of the Price City redevelopment
agency (RDA).
Funding for improvements and business assistance in downtown has been administered through the
city for several years. It is recommended that an extension or renewal of the RDA occurs, to maximize
the ability for assisting revitalization efforts well into the future.
Holding special events, such as farmers' markets, art festivals and other street fairs, can be an
effective method to draw more attention and business to the downtown area. Combining the efforts of
the city with that of downtown business owners, the Carbon County chamber of commerce as well as
local resident volunteers can create successful special event ventures.
With the help of economic and planning consultants, and the use of a community survey focused on
the downtown area, the city has recently identified several unmet commercial and retail demands and
community needs that can and should be met downtown (see appendix D, "Price City Community
Survey And Executive Summary", Wikstrom Economic and Planning Consultants, as referenced in the
ordinance codified herein, on file in the city). These include:
A. Additional retail anchors;
B. Restaurants, for lunchtime as well as nighttime dining;
C. Apparel stores, including specialty clothing and shoes;
D. Specialty shops such as sporting goods, nurseries/garden supplies, sewing, hobbies, crafts,
stationery and books;
E. Entertainment, such as bowling, theaters, live music. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.190: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 387/407
Historically, the economy of Price and surrounding areas has had a strong relationship with the
development and production of energy resources, such as coal mining. As energy uses and needs
change, and new resources are utilized, reliance on the economy of energy production can create
difficulties for the community. Diversity into the various fields of business and manufacturing are the
growing trend for successful economic pursuits in Price.
It is the city's intent to achieve the most desirable results in economic development pursuits. To this
end, an economic development plan should be prepared and followed by the city in order to achieve
the results desired by the community. The preparation of the plan should be the oversight of a city
economic development advisory committee, which would work in concert with the goals and efforts of
the Carbon County economic development program.
Initially, the city economic development committee and plan should focus on:
A. Encouraging the attraction and development of business and industry that offer Price new jobs
and diversified economic vitality;
B. Continuing and improving upon assistance programs and funding for the retention and
development existing businesses;
C. Promoting tourism to Price and regional attractions; and
D. Improving the image of the community as a great place to live, work and play.
A second city motto, selected by the general plan advisory committee and intended for use in
economic development pursuits, is:
Price City, A Place of Value
City economic development marketing materials and promotional programs should focus on the use of
this motto in showcasing the city and its opportunities.
An effective tool for assisting new business ventures and the expansion of existing businesses is
found in the Price City economic vitality fund, administered by the city. Granting loans of up to ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00), the city's program emphasizes the need for loan recipients to improve
local property values, generate employment and increase local economic activity. This program should
be continued and strengthened when possible. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.200: TOURISM:
Continued development of tourism to Price and regional attractions is another opportunity to positively
impact the local economy. Working in association with the Carbon County travel bureau and regional
agencies, the city can actively assist the promotion of tourism. To do this effectively, marketing
strategies need to be defined, and the necessary resources need to be dedicated. Efforts should be
increased towards promoting Price, with its plethora of nearby attractions and recreation opportunities,
as a destination for travelers and outdoor sports enthusiasts.
Unique characteristics of the community and the surrounding areas need to be identified and
emphasized. Continued and increased emphasis should occur in promoting and building upon existing
special amenities and themes, such as the prehistoric museum and native peoples. (Ord. 2004-001,
2004)
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 388/407
17.10.210: COMMUNITY IMAGE:
Related to the promotion of tourism and economic development are efforts to improve the image of
the community. Promotion should focus on the community as a great place to live, work and play,
which offers opportunities and services in all areas of life. Strong quality of life factors existing in Price
should be emphasized, such as the availability of recreation and outdoor adventures, strong
educational resources, the fairgrounds and special events, the CEU Prehistoric Museum, good
medical facilities, a low cost of living and a safe atmosphere.
Beautification efforts in downtown, along main corridors and at community entryways, as described in
article III of this chapter, will have significant impact on improving the community image. Improved
community image can have positive long term economic benefits on the city. New residents, including
both work force and retirement aged people will be attracted to looking at making Price their home.
More travelers will look to Price as a nice, fun destination rather than a place they bypass. More
businesses will look to Price as an attractive community to do business in.

Article V. Transportation
17.10.220: INTRODUCTION:
The effectiveness and functionality of the transportation system and how it services population growth,
has significant impact on the community. The city plans to develop and maintain a system that is
efficient and complements the quality of life in Price. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.230: TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN:
It is the intent of the city to prepare and adopt a Price City transportation master plan. Planning and
providing for safe and efficient transportation is the chief objective of such a plan. When completed,
the master plan will be a vital appendix to this article.
A transportation master plan includes planning for the flow of traffic on and the use of city streets. In
the streets component of a transportation plan, policies are established which foster a safe and
effective street system, classify streets according to their intended function, establish street design
requirements, and identify areas where street improvements are needed. The "Streets Classification
Map, Exhibit 5", of this article, shows the existing and intended use of Price City streets by
classification.
Goals for improving and developing necessary transportation infrastructure are outlined in a master
plan. The following transportation issues relating to streets and vehicular traffic are included in the
goals of the Price City plan:
A. Street improvement projects, including the connection of Cedar Hills Drive: 1) to Homestead
Boulevard; and 2) the construction of Anadarko Road to Airport Road, and Wood Hill Road; and
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 391/407
B. Highway improvement, including increased efforts to make U.S. Highway 6 into an interstate
freeway.
Additionally, open space areas around the city should be reviewed to determine needs for possible
access and improved traffic flow. Connections may be warranted from the southern end of 700 East
Street to Highway 55, and between the Castle Heights and Sagewood areas to Airport Road. (Ord.
2004-001, 2004)
17.10.240: PUBLIC TRANSIT:
Planning for mass transit systems, such as bus, rail and air traffic systems, is another important
component to be included in the Price City transportation master plan. This area of transportation has
much potential for further development in Price.
As a community grows and improves, greater emphasis and desire is placed on the development of
public transit systems. Concepts needing further development in relation to public transit systems in
Price include:
A. Developing a public transit system between Helper, Price and Wellington;
B. Placing more emphasis on the development and use of the airport;
C. Developing a bus station in Price; and
D. Developing a train station in Price. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.250: ALTERNATIVE MODES:
Alternative modes of transportation are strongly encouraged in Price. A system of bicycle and
pedestrian pathways is planned throughout the city to allow for easy access and connection to most
areas of the city. For more information, see article VII, "Parks And Recreation", and "Parks,
Recreation, And Trails, Exhibit 6", of this chapter.

(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
Article VI. Housing
17.10.260: INTRODUCTION:
This article focuses on the need for diverse housing opportunities in Price. Although the population
has remained relatively stable over recent years, needs for various types of housing have increased.
Having a median housing value of ninety two thousand dollars ($92,000.00), per the 2000 census, the
housing market in Price is currently comprised largely of single-family, detached homes. The median
monthly mortgage is seven hundred fifty six dollars ($756.00), and the median rent is four hundred
nine dollars ($409.00). Nearly sixty percent (60%) of the homes in Price were built prior to 1970.
Addressing the needs for housing, the city has identified several issues, including the need for an
improved mix of housing options, more moderate income housing options, infill housing development,
and more quality high density housing projects. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.270: HOUSING DENSITY AND OPTIONS:
Eighty percent (80%) of the housing in Price currently falls within a single-family designation. The
remaining twenty percent (20%), representing various types of attached or multi-family housing units,
provide most of the affordable housing options in the community. It is the city's desire to preserve
existing areas of low density housing, while at the same time allowing for increased medium to high
density housing needs, such as student, senior and other quality attached housing developments.
While the importance of providing affordable housing has increased in recent years, the concept of
providing a healthy balance of quality mid level and higher end housing is being recognized as an
increasingly important goal. A diversification within Price City neighborhoods, including a mixture of
low, moderate and even high income housing units, is desired. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 395/407
17.10.280: MODERATE INCOME HOUSING:
Moderate income housing has become an increasingly imperative issue for Price City in recent years.
Economic conditions have caused housing costs in Price to increase at rates higher than personal
income and wages. Because of this imbalance, many residents have been excluded from adequate
housing opportunities. The 2000 census points out that nearly ninety eight percent (98%) (based on
mean values) of the families living in Price are within the low to moderate income levels.
The state of Utah defines moderate income housing as "housing occupied or reserved for occupancy
by households with a gross household income equal to or less than eighty percent (80%) of the
median gross income of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) for households of the same size". In
other words, moderate income housing is a function of the particular circumstances and income levels
of the community, rather than a type of housing.
In an effort to meet the needs for moderate income housing in the Price community, a plan was
created in October 2002 describing several policies and establishing goals. The Price Municipal
Corporation community affordable housing plan is designed to assist decision making with housing
issues. (See appendix D, as referenced in the ordinance codified herein, on file in the city.) (Ord.
2004-001, 2004)
17.10.290: QUALITY HIGH DENSITY HOUSING:
In trying to meet the need for a balanced mix of housing in Price, a key objective is to seek and
require development of high quality. High density residential developments, such as condominiums,
townhomes, etc., which are not geared toward meeting low or moderate income housing objectives,
are currently too few in number. The development of projects which include quality design,
landscaping, amenities and good maintenance should be encouraged and sought as new housing
demands increase.
A. Student Housing: An important and continuing need for high density housing is in the realm of
student housing. As the student enrollment increases, further needs for providing student housing
locations will arise. Areas close in proximity to the College of Eastern Utah are deemed best for
additional student housing development. Nearby accommodations reduce car trips, make student
life more affordable, and help current single-family housing areas maintain their integrity.
B. Senior Citizen Housing: Seniors play an important role in the community and are a growing faction
of the local population. More quality senior housing developments need to be encouraged, which
will integrate within the single-family low density zones and become an asset to the community.
Assisted living residential projects are encouraged throughout the community in facilities
constructed for that purpose. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.300: INFILL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT:
As Price continues to grow, residential development is encouraged to take place on the remaining
developable lots found throughout the community.
A mix of all types of housing is desired in the community, and new construction is encouraged to take
advantage of infill development opportunities.

Article VII. Parks And Recreation
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 398/407
17.10.310: INTRODUCTION:
Price City recognizes the need to provide parks and recreation facilities and services which enhance
the quality of life of the residents. Included in the scope and objectives for parks and recreation in
Price are plans for recreational trails, including bicycle, pedestrian and equestrian paths for public use
throughout the city. An emphasis is also given to supporting and providing cultural activities and
community services that enhance quality of life.
An objective of Price City is to provide comprehensive recreation programs, services, facilities and
resources that allow and encourage participation by all residents. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.320: PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN:
Like many communities throughout the U.S., Price City is experiencing a continuing desire for more
recreational opportunities. This creates the need for a plan to meet the current and future recreational
needs and desires of the community. A parks and recreation master plan would provide a proactive
"road map" for guiding future planning, design and implementation decisions. The implementation of
such a plan, which would act as an appendix to this document, will make the use of parks, trails and
recreation facilities an integral part of daily life in Price.
The beginnings of a parks and recreation master plan was developed through the creation of this
document, with public input provided though the general plan update process, as described in the plan
update section in article I of this chapter. A map of existing and proposed facilities and locations was
created through this process (see "Parks, Recreation, And Trails, Exhibit 6", of this article). (Ord.
2004-001, 2004)
17.10.330: FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS:
Existing parks and recreation facilities in Price are a source of pride and expertly maintained to high
levels of safety and operation, providing recreational facilities for residents and visitors.
Price City parks and recreation facilities include:
A. Desert Wave pool;
B. Washington park;
C. Pioneer park;
D. Terrace Hills park;
E. Underpass park;
F. Price City Peace Garden;
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 399/407
G. South Price park;
H. Detention Basin park;
I. Atwood Baseball Complex;
J. CEU Prehistoric Museum;
K. Heritage park;
L. Rose park;
M. Skate park;
N. BMX Track park.
Additional facilities adjacent to Price City boundaries, which are operated and maintained by Carbon
County include the county fairgrounds and sports complex, motocross and model airplane airport.
Also, proposed new parks, trails and open space areas have been identified as shown in "Parks,
Recreation, And Trails, Exhibit 6", of this article. Many of the local recreation programs in Price are
currently administered through the Carbon County recreation department. As the need expands for
additional programs, the city may see the need to increase involvement in programming through
staffing and increased involvement on the county recreation board. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.340: RECREATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM:
The quality of life in a community is enhanced when it has a system of recreational trails, including
bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian paths and facilities. A trails system also acts as an asset to the city
transportation network. Increased levels of walking and bicycling due to the creation of these facilities
leads to a cleaner environment and a healthier population.
Safety for bicycles is an important issue. According to the "Bicycle And Pedestrian Planning Guide,
Parsons Brinckerhoff", Utah's bicycle fatality rate is thirty six percent (36%) higher than the national
average, which is caused by a lack of safe bicycle corridors. Many local trips that Price residents
currently make in their cars might be made on foot or by bicycle if they could do so on established
safe trail corridors.
Where practical, bicycle and pedestrian paths in Price should: a) be separated from vehicular traffic;
b) be constructed with separated bike and pedestrian lanes; and c) provide a connection between
parks and open spaces.
Planning for equestrian and OHV recreational trails is also important to the community of Price, in
terms of both recreation and tourism. The planning and development of such trails should be
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 400/407
coordinated with county and regional trails organizations.
Parks, Recreation, And Trails
Exhibit 6
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.350: CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND FACILITIES:
Providing and fostering cultural institutions and activities which enhance the community's quality of life
is recognized as an important objective of the Price community. Several programs have become a
significant part of Price's cultural life and character, which include the efforts of the Price City culture
connection, a community based organization to showcase the talents and culture available in Price
and surrounding communities. The city also sponsors events such as the annual International Days, a
festival which celebrates the culture, heritage, food, music and arts of the community.
A source of community pride can be found in the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum, located
in the heart of the community, as well as the heart of dinosaur country. A unique and celebrated
facility, the museum boasts a wide assortment of dinosaur fossils and ancient human artifacts.
Other civic and private organizations play important roles in the community culture as well. Fostering
an environment where such organizations can develop and flourish is an ideal of the city which enjoys
much support from the community.

Article VIII. Public Facilities And Services
17.10.360: INTRODUCTION:
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 403/407
This article addresses the various aspects and policies of public facilities, services and activities in the
city, including administrative offices, library, public works and public safety facilities. The city, through
its organizational structure, administers the city water, wastewater, storm drainage, electrical and other
public facilities. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.370: MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND SERVICES:
A. City Administration: Administration of the city organization occurs at Price City hall, located in the
downtown area at 185 East Main Street. Offices and services found within this building are the
mayor's office, city council/planning commission chambers, administrative and finance offices,
human resources, community services, the city library, and the city auditorium. Adjoining this
building is the CEU Prehistoric Museum (see article VII of this chapter).
The Price Municipal Corporation, the official name of the city organization, is organized and
operated with concern for providing efficient and effective utilization of resources governmental
services to the residents of the community.
B. City Library: Located at 159 East Main Street in the city hall building, the Price City library is the
foremost library facility in Carbon County and the region. The original Price City library was
established in 1915, through the Carnegie Library endowment program. In addition to an excellent
collection of books and printed resources, the library also maintains a supply of computers and
software, which are available to all library patrons. Expanding and improving library services is a
constant aspiration and goal of the city.
C. Public Works: The Price City public works division strives to make the city an accessible,
functioning and healthy community. Located at 432 West 600 South, the "domes" house the offices
for public works, engineering, water, sewer, streets, fleet, city parks, the cemetery and the
swimming pool. In providing city services, the public works division endeavors to be organized,
trained and operate in an orderly and diligent process.
D. Public Utilities: Public utilities provided to the community by Price City include sewer treatment,
electrical power (through Utah Power and Light), water and irrigation water. Garbage pick up is
also administered through the utilities department. The Price City utilities office is located in city
hall, at 185 East Main Street.
E. Police Department: Located at 81 North 200 East, the Price City police department operates under
a primary objective, which is:
A society free from crime and disorder remains an unachieved ideal; nevertheless, consistent
with the values of a free society, it is the primary objective of the Price City police department to as
closely as possible approach that ideal. In so doing, the department's role is to enforce the law in a
fair and impartial manner, recognizing both the statutory and judicial limitations of police authority
and the constitutional rights of all persons. It is not the role of the department to legislate, to render
legal judgments, or to punish.
F. Fire Department: The Price City fire department, located at 87 North 200 East, averages four
hundred (400) calls per year. This highly trained full service organization provides fire suppression
9/10/2020 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=687 404/407
and emergency medical services twenty four (24) hours every day to the community. The
department has twenty four (24) trained "volunteer call firefighters". All firefighters are state
certified. (Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.380: EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT:
It is the objective of the city to support, where possible, the educational institutions within the
community, to emphasize the importance of education for all citizens. A close working relationship
needs to be maintained with the Carbon County School District to encourage and facilitate the
improvement of elementary and secondary education in Price.
The city needs to actively participate in and support the growth and development of the College of
Eastern Utah, to understand the needs and impacts of this noteworthy higher education institution.
Support for continued programs through the Utah State University Extension is likewise warranted.
(Ord. 2004-001, 2004)
17.10.390: COMMUNITY SERVICES:
A. Healthcare Support: To have good, quality healthcare and facilities that meet the healthcare needs
of the community is a primary goal of Price City. Existing healthcare facilities, such as the IHC
Castleview Hospital, currently provide a foundation for quality healthcare. The health of the
community is an issue that should always concern city leaders. One method Price City has
identified to address healthcare issues and needs in the community is the creation of healthcare
committee, comprised of representatives of local healthcare providers, governmental leaders and
interested citizens. The tasks of such a committee should include performing a comprehensive
healthcare needs assessment, and developing a community healthcare plan for continued and
improved services in Price. (See also appendix A, "Price City: A 21st Century Community,
Healthcare Issues", as referenced in the ordinance codified herein, on file in the city.)
B. Telecommunications: Price City has strong interest and has taken a proactive role in the planning
and encouragement of updated and quality telecommunication systems in the community.
Sponsoring technology workshops and hosting the Smart Utah Conference have brought the
importance of using and understanding telecommunications systems to the residents. Efforts to
increase the community's involvement and understanding of these systems is an ongoing goal of
the city.
Providing municipal business services to the community through internet services, including utility
department functions and business licensing, is a city priority. (See also appendix A, "Price City: A
21st Century Community, Telecommunications Issues", as referenced in the ordinance codified
herein, on file in the city.)

existing drainage and irrigation
systems including all rivers,
creeks, streams, washes and flood
plains. Show pre-development
and post-development contours at
2 foot intervals. Show locations
and elevations of proposed
structures. Establish and show the
finished floor elevations (first and

basins, piping, open channels,
bridges and other specific drainage
features.
3. Drainage analysis that shows the
peak flow rate and peak volume
calculations for the predevelopment
and post-development
conditions.
4. Analysis and Design Criteria.
The rational method is to be
employed for watersheds less than
or equal to 10 acres. Peak rate and
volume calculations are to be based
on the 50 year 1 hour storm for the
storm drainage network. Use an
intensity of 1.10 inches per hour for
1 hour or other local reliable
precipitation data.
The Natural Resource Conservation
Service (NRCS) method is to be
used on watersheds larger than 10
acres. Peak rate and volume
calculations are to be based on the
100 year 24 hour storm event with
a type 2 distribution for the storm
drainage network.
Post development conditions shall
not exceed predevelopment
conditions. Check for the 5, 10, 25,
50 and 100 year storms and related
flood routing. Delineate the
watersheds for each catch basin and
inlet. Design the storm sewer pipe
network for the 50 year 1 hour
storm. Evaluate the effects of the
100 year storm. Runoff and
flooding shall be contained within
the streets and storm sewer pipeline
network.
Storm water detention basins, inlets
and outlets shall be designed for the
100 year storm event.
5. Each lot will be developed and built
so that there is a positive grade
away from all structures. Property
owners shall be responsible for
controlling drainage runoff that is
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 3
3-12
generated onsite. Onsite detention
shall be developed as necessary.
Discharge of runoff from the site
shall be directed towards approved
street and natural drainage ways.
6. Structures on lots shall not be built
with basement garage driveways or
basement stair accesses that
directly connect to the street.
7. Evaluation of potential pollution,
contamination and construction site
discharge through storm water
runoff from the facilities or
features of the development. The
results of the evaluation may
require source control, pretreatment
and pollution prevention
practices to be implemented to
control polluted storm water
runoff.
9. Survey Information: Plans for land
surveying shall be prepared and
certification made as to plan accuracy
by a registered professional land
surveyor properly licensed to do such
work in the State of Utah. A
workmanlike execution of the plan
shall be made in every detail. A
poorly drawn or illegible plan is
sufficient cause for final plan
rejection. Engineering plans and
details shall be calculated, designed,
prepared or reviewed by a qualified
and licensed engineer. Plans shall
provide the following survey
information:
1. Bearings, distances and curve
data for all perimeter boundary
lines with ties to 2 existing legal
survey monuments unless
otherwise required by the City
Engineer). A traverse of the
perimeter boundary lines from the
existing legal survey monuments
shall have an error of closure of
not greater than 3 in 100.
Bearings, distances and curve
data shall also be given for all
interior lot lines and dimensions
including irregularly shaped lots.
Distances shall be given in
hundredths of a foot, angles in
decimal degrees to hundredths of
a degree, and bearings in degreesminutes-
seconds of an arc.
2. Sufficient curve data shall be
given to enable the
reestablishment of the curves on
the ground. Include a table of
curve data. This curve data shall
include the following
information:
1. Radius of curve.
2. Central angle.
3. Tangent.
4. Arc length.
5. Chord (bearing and distance).
3. Parcels bounded by a body of
water shall have the bearings and
distances of a closing meander
traverse given and notation made
that the parcel includes all land to
the waters edge or high water
mark or 100 year flood elevation.
4. Legal descriptions and labels of
major parcels, road dedications
and parcels to be dedicated to the
public.

4.1. TITLE.
The regulations contained in this chapter shall
be known and may be cited as Sign
Regulations or Sign Code of Price City and
its Land Development Code.
4.2. PURPOSE.
The purpose of sign regulations set forth in this
code shall be to coordinate the type, placement,
and physical dimensions of signs within Price
City; to recognize the various commercial
communication requirements of all sectors of
the business community; to encourage the
innovative use of design; to promote both
renovation and proper maintenance; to allow for
special circumstances; and to guarantee equal
treatment under law through accurate record
keeping and consistent enforcement. These
objectives shall be accomplished by regulation
of display, erection, use, and maintenance of
signs. The use and location of signs are
regulated according to zoning district. The
placement and physical dimensions of signs are
regulated primarily by type.
Further purposes are to minimize potential
hazards to motorists and pedestrians; to
encourage signs which, by their design, are
integrated with and harmonious to the buildings
and sites which they occupy; to encourage sign
legibility through the elimination of excessive
and confusing sign displays; to reduce driver
inattention; to preserve and improve the
appearance of Price City as a place in which to
live and to work as an attraction to nonresidents
who come to visit or trade; to safeguard and
enhance property values; to limit signs which
may interfere with solar access of adjacent
properties; to protect public and private
investment in buildings and open spaces; to
supplement and be a part of the regulations
imposed under the zoning authority of Price
City. The purpose of this Sign Code is not to
regulate sign content or message on its face as
restricted in the U.S. Supreme Courts decision
in Reed v. Town of Gilbert on June 18, 2015.1
4.3. SCOPE.
These regulations shall not relate to or regulate
building design, official traffic or official
government signs, street signs; the copy and
message of signs, signs not intended to be
viewed from a public right-of-way, window
displays; product dispensers and point of
purchase displays, scoreboards on athletic
fields, flags of any nation, government or noncommercial
organization, gravestones, barber
poles, religious symbols, commemorative
plaques, the display of street numbers, or any
display or construction not defined in this code
as a sign.
4.4. INTERPRETATION.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of
this code, the sign regulations contained herein
are declared to be the minimum standards

LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 6
6-3
2. Where precise applicable parking standards
are not known or have proven unsatisfactory
in other instances, the analysis of the
parking requirements of the site and its
proposed use is to assure a reasonable
number of parking spaces that cannot
become an excuse for failure of the use on
the site to perform its function properly.

functions are not to be curtailed due to lack
of sufficient parking and therefore the use or
function of the principal user of the site fails
and otherwise deteriorates.

7.1. GENERAL
1. PURPOSE AND INTENT. The purpose
of this chapter and the intent of Price City
in its adoption is to promote the health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare
of the present and future inhabitants of
Price City. This chapter accomplishes the
aforesaid purpose and intent by providing
sufficient flexibility to allow in certain
areas compatible integration of uses
which are related to the permitted uses of
the zoning district or are of a temporary
nature only, but which may be suitable
and desirable only in certain locations in
that zoning district due to conditions and
circumstances peculiar to that location
and/or upon certain conditions which
make the uses suitable and/or only if such
uses are designed, laid out, and
constructed on the proposed site in a
particular manner. While flexibility in
allowing uses which would otherwise be
generally unsuitable in a given zoning
district is an important goal of this
chapter, it is also recognized that
constraints on governmental decision
making are a legal imperative. This
chapter, therefore, also provides a
framework of standards within which
those governmental decisions must be
made.
2. CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
REQUIRED. A conditional use permit
shall be required for all uses listed as
conditional uses in this Code and any
proposed uses not contemplated herein.
Requirements may also be imposed upon
permitted uses to the extent the
requirement is consistent with 7.1.1
above.
1. For the following types of conditional
uses, final plan or plat approval shall
constitute the conditional use permit:
1. Subdivisions. Minor
subdivision consisting of a one
(1) lot subdivision may be
approved and processed in
accordance with the terms of
this Code administratively.
2. Planned unit developments.
3.Recreation vehicle parks.
2. For all other types of conditional or
permitted uses, final plan or plat
approval, a specific conditional use
permit or list of Land Code
compliance requirements will be
issued for the particular use as
appropriate or as provided for in this
code.
3. Valid conditional use permits issued
by Price City are considered attached
to the property. Minor developments
or information (name change)
requiring amendment to the
previously issued conditional use
permit may be completed
administratively, or at the direction of
the Zoning Administrator. Other
substitute amendments may require
additional review by the Planning and
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-2
Zoning Commission and approval by
the City Council.
4. REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
1. In the event any person holding a
conditional use permit pursuant to
this section violates the terms of the
permit or violates the requirements of
a permitted use, or conducts or carries
on said site development in such a
manner as to materially adversely
affect the health, welfare, or safety of
persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the property of the
said permittee, a temporary
suspension may be made effective
immediately upon notification by the
Zoning Administrator.
2. No conditional use permit shall be
permanently revoked or suspended
until review and approval of the
revocation or suspension is completed
by the City Council. The permittee
shall be notified in writing of such
review and said notification shall
state:
1. The grounds for complaint or
reasons for the revocation or
suspension, in clear and concise
language.
2. The time and place such review
is to be held. Such notice shall be
served by certified mail or
personal service on the permittee
at least 5 days prior to the date
set for the review. At any such
review hearing the permittee
shall be given an opportunity to
be heard, and may call witnesses
and present evidence on his/her
behalf. Upon conclusion of such
review the City Council shall
determine whether or not the
permit should be suspended or
revoked.
3. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may hold a
preliminary review to consider its
recommendations to the City
Council for revocation or
suspension of permits, which
may already have been
temporarily suspended, at the
next regularly scheduled meeting
of the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
5. NON-TRANSFERABLE. Conditional
use permits are non-transferable, however
they do attach to the property and may be
assumed by subsequent property owners
or users upon written notice of
concurrence with all existing conditions
of approval.
6. EXPIRATION OF PERMIT. Every
conditional use permit shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if
the work authorized by such permit has
not been commenced within 1 year, or is
not completed within 2 years from date
of issue; except that the Planning and
Zoning Commission may, if the permit
holder presents satisfactory evidence that
special circumstances or unusual
difficulties have prevented work being
started or completed within the specified
time limits, grant a reasonable extension
of time, in up to one year intervals, if
written application is made and approved
before the expiration of the permit.
7. GROUNDS FOR DENIAL OF A
CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
APPLICATION. The following shall
constitute grounds for denial of a
conditional use permit application:
1. Under circumstances of the particular
case, the proposed use will be
detrimental to the health, safety or
general welfare of persons residing or
working in the vicinity, or injurious to
property or improvements in the
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-3
vicinity and there is no practical
means available to the applicant to
effectively mitigate said detrimental
effects. Denial of an application must
include a formal written finding on
the record that a compelling,
countervailing public interest may be
jeopardized if the application is
approved.1
2. The applicant cannot or does not give
the Planning and Zoning Commission
reasonable assurance that conditions
imposed incident to issuance of a
conditional use permit will be
complied with.
3. Unsatisfactory past performance such
as: failure to comply with past permit
conditions or current/past permit
violations2.
4. Requested conditional use is not
permittable under the provisions of
this code.
5. Failure to complete all application
requirements and/or pay all required
fees.
8. ISSUANCE OF CONDITIONAL USE
PERMIT TO BE DEPENDENT ON
AFFIRMATIVE FINDINGS.
Conditional uses may be approved by the
City Council upon recommendation of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, in
locations permitting such uses in this
Code. Before approval is granted, a
report to the City Council by the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall
find that the proposed development will
meet the requirements of this Code.
9. GENERAL INSPECTION. Following
the issuance of a conditional use permit
by the City Council, the Zoning
Administrator, City Engineer or Building
1 HB 311 (2018) and Vesting in State Statute section 10-
9a-509.

Inspector, shall inspect such use to insure
that development is undertaken and
completed in compliance with the
conditional use permit.
10. CONSTRUCTION SHALL MEET OR
EXCEED THE CITYS
IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS.
Construction standards, including
drawings, details, calculations, tables,
charts, references and regulations may be
adopted by resolution by the City
Council, and when done so shall
constitute minimum land development
standards supplementing this Code.
Additional standards may be required by
conditional use permit.
11. CONFLICTING PROVISIONS. Where
specific requirements are made or
exemptions allowed under other sections
of this Code, those requirements or
exemptions shall prevail over the land
development standards supplementing
this Code.
12. IMPROVEMENT CONSTRUCTION
TO BE OBLIGATION OF
DEVELOPER. Public improvements
required by this Code shall be
constructed at the expense of the
developer and shall comply with the land
development standards supplementing
this Code. Public infrastructure shall be
considered dedicated to the public with
final approval of the conditional use
permit.
13. COMMENCEMENT OF
CONSTRUCTION. Site improvement or
grading of any proposed development
site prior to Preliminary Design Plan
approval by the Planning and Zoning

5. CONDITIONS RELATING TO
PERFORMANCE
1. Time limits on the validity of the
conditional use permit. Such time
limits shall be determined by the
following guidelines:
1. A conditional use permit for uses
which are of a temporary nature
only may be issued for the
intended duration of the
temporary use or for 2 years,
whichever period of time is
shorter.

year intervals, when deemed in
the public interest.
2. The work may be guaranteed by filing
a surety bond or other valuable
assurance in favor of and acceptable
to Price City in an amount to be
determined by the Public Works
Director or City Engineer or City
Council. The amount of said surety

However, in the following instances the
holding of a public hearing shall be
mandatory:
1. The Planning and Zoning
Commission determines that existing
streets and thoroughfares are not
suitable and adequate to carry
anticipated traffic, and increased
densities resulting from the proposed
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-7
use may generate traffic in such
amounts as to overload the street
network outside the zoning district.
2. The Planning and Zoning
Commission determines that increases
in miscellaneous traffic, light, odor, or
environmental pollution generated by
the proposed use may significantly
change the intended characteristics of
the zoning district as outlined in this
Code.
3. The Planning and Zoning
Commission determines that the
architectural design of the proposed
use varies significantly from the
architectural characteristics of the
zoning district (as outlined in this
Code) in which such use is proposed.
7.3. STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL
USE DEVELOPMENTS.
When applicable, the following general
standards shall apply to all conditional use
developments within Price City, unless waived
or limited in application of the development
standard for good and sufficient reasons by the
Planning and Zoning Commission:
1. The development shall be in single,
group or corporate ownership at the time
of application, or the subject of an
application filed jointly by all owners of
the property.
2. Landscaping, fencing, and screening
within the site and as a means of
integrating the proposed development
into its surroundings shall be planned and
presented to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for approval, together with
other required plans for the development.
3. The size, location, design and nature of
signs, if any, and the intensity and
direction of lighting or floodlighting shall
be detailed in the application.
4. A grading and drainage plan shall be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission with the application in
compliance with the Price City Drainage
Design Criteria.
5. A planting / landscaping plan showing
the proposed tree, shrubbery, and lawn
plantings shall be prepared for the entire
site to be developed, including especially
the yards and parkways which abut upon
or are within the right-of-way of public
streets.
6. It shall be shown that under the
circumstances of the particular case, the
proposed use will not be detrimental to
the health, safety, or general welfare of
persons residing in the vicinity of the
conditional use development.
7. All buildings used for human occupancy
when completed shall be served by a
central water system and central sewage
disposal system which have been
approved by the Building Official and
which are in compliance with applicable
local and state law.
8. In order to insure that the development
will be constructed to completion in
accordance with approved plans, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall
require the developer to post a surety
bond or mortgage or other valuable
assurance acceptable to the City Council
in an amount equal to the estimated cost,
plus 10%, of constructing all required
landscaping, fencing, street lighting,
drainage, irrigation, road improvements,
pedestrian ways, bike paths, curbs and
gutters, hard surfacing, drinking water
and sewer lines, fire protection, and
traffic control and signals, as shown on
the final site plan. Estimates of cost shall
be furnished by the developer which will
be checked for accuracy by the Planning
and Zoning Commission staff. Final
determination of the amount of the surety
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-8
bond or other assurance shall be
approved and directed by the City
Council.
1. The duration of the bond or other
assurance shall be for one or more
years from the date of approval of the
development by the City Council. An
extension of time for completion may
be granted by the City Council upon
application by the developers,
provided such application is
submitted at least 60 days prior to the
expiration of the surety bond or other
assurance and provided the issuer of
the bond is willing to extend the time
of the assurance. Said assurance shall
not expire prior to completion of the
project and approval of release by the
City Council.
2. In the event the developer defaults or
fails or neglects to satisfactorily
install the required improvements
within one year from the date of
approval and approved extensions of
the development by the City Council
or to pay all liens in connection
therewith, the City Council may
declare the surety bond or other
assurance forfeited and Price City
shall install or cause the required
improvements to be installed using
the proceeds from the collection of
the bond or other assurance to defray
the expense thereof.
In the event there is a development
requiring a Conditional Use Permit
with the stipulation that a street rightof-
way be dedicated and certain
improvements be completed within
the right-of-way in front or adjacent
to the development, then the
improvement may be guaranteed by
one of two options:
a. Complete the agreement and post a
surety for a guarantee and record the
plat, thus allowing developer the
ability to sell platted parcels and
apply for a building permit to
construct a building, prior to
completing the improvements in the
right of way. However, in no case
may the house receive an occupancy
permit prior to the completion of the
improvements in the right-of-way.
The duration of the surety shall not
expire prior to the completion of the
improvements.
b. Complete the agreement without
submitting a surety for a guarantee
and without recording the plat, thus
allowing the developer the ability to
complete the improvements without
the expense of a surety for a
guarantee. However, the developer
shall not be allowed to sell any
parcels or receive apply for a valid
building permit issued by Price City
until all of the improvements are
complete, a 10% one year guarantee
is posted and the plat has been
recorded. This would not apply to all
conditional uses, particularly where it
does not involve a street dedication
and/or street improvements.
3. The developer shall be responsible for
the quality of all materials installed
and workmanship. At the completion
of the work, or not less than 10 days
prior to the release date of the surety
bond or other assurance, the Citys
Engineer shall make a preliminary
inspection of the improvements made
and submit a report to the City
Council setting forth the conditions of
such facilities. If all liens are paid and
other conditions thereof are found to
be satisfactory, the City Council shall
release the surety bond or other
assurance. If the condition of material
or workmanship shows unusual
depreciation or does not comply with
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-9
the acceptable minimum standards,
standards required by conditional use
permit, or durability or if any
outstanding liens are not paid, the
City Council may declare the
developer in default.
9. In the event that the land contained
within a development is traversed by a
proposed major street, water line, sewer
line, or drainage channel shown in the
General Plan or Transportation Master
Plan, or described in a general plan
element or map, said development shall
be designed in accordance therewith. The
right-of-way across the development for
such transportation and circulation
elements, or other right-of-way shall be
deeded to the City or dedicated to the
public.
10. Grouping and spacing of buildings and
dwellings in residential areas shall
provide for a restful and un-crowded
environment. Landscaped areas shall be
encouraged as the dominant features of
the development. Areas not covered by
buildings or by off-street parking space
or driveways shall generally be planted /
landscaped into natural vegetation, lawn,
trees and shrubs, and otherwise
landscaped and maintained in accordance
with good landscape practice as approved
on the final plan. Permanent automatic
irrigation systems shall be installed when
required by the Planning and Zoning
Commission to provide for maintenance
of planted areas.
11. Details of plans, plats, and documents to
be submitted showing the size of land,
size of water lines, drainage lines, sewer
lines and other domestic sewage disposal
facilities, garbage and trash disposal, the
quality of materials and improvements,
protection from adverse influences,
lighting, landscaping, off-street parking,
grading and other details of design and
construction shall conform to standards
as set forth in such resolutions pertaining
to such standards as may be adopted by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
12. The development shall meet all standards
and requirements of this Code and all
requirements of applicable ordinances,
and Utah law.
13. The development shall be in keeping with
the general character of the zoning
district within which it is to be located.
14. The Planning and Zoning Commission
(may require) expects that details,
drawings, plats and plans for the
development be prepared by a qualified
professional team, licensed engineers,
architects and surveyors. In all cases, it is
recommended that professional design
and other assistance be obtained early in
the project program. It is the intent of
Price City that the developer solves all
the problems and addressed all issues
before approval is given and construction
begins.
15. Storm drainage facilities shall be so
constructed as to protect residents of the
development as well as adjacent property
owners. Such facilities shall be of
sufficient capacity to insure controlled
drainage and prevent the accumulation of
stagnant pools of water in or adjacent to
the development.
16. All structures required by this Code to
have building permits and all uses
required to have use permits shall be
inspected by the a Building Official in
accordance with procedures established
by the most recent edition of the
International Building Code, as adopted
by Price City and this Code; provided,
however, that no building permit for such
structures or use permits shall be issued
until the Planning Commission, or the
Zoning Administrator if authorized by
the Planning and Zoning Commission
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-10
and City Council, has issued a
conditional use permit for the building
site or use or have determined that a
conditional use permit is not required by
this Code.
17. All land subdivision and development
occurring within 100 feet of the
centerline of a canal requires the
notification of the owner or operator of
the canal of the subdivision or
development as required by State law
(HB 298, 2010) by the land use authority.
Approval of the land use application must
not be approved until 20 days after notice
to the canal owner or operator is mailed
to allow sufficient time for the canal
owner or operator to respond. The canal
owner or operator shall provide input
regarding: (1) access to the canal; (2)
maintenance of the canal; (3) canal
protection; (4) canal safety. (HB 310
2017).4
18. Fire Safety. Vehicle access shall be
provided within 100 feet of temporary or
permanent fire department connections.
Vehicle access shall be provided by
either permanent or temporary roads.
Temporary roads shall be constructed to a
minimum standard complying with Price
City standards and direction from the
Price City Fire Chief and/or Price City
Engineer. Temporary roads shall be
appropriately maintained until permanent
fire apparatus access roads are available.
Temporary or permanent fire department
access roads shall be functional before
above ground construction begins and
prior to combustible construction.5
4 HB298 in 2010 originally required the developer to
notify the canal company of development within 100 feet
of the canal centerline. HB 301 in 2017 changed
requiring the land use authority to send the notice; for the
canal company to provide certain comments and for a 20
day waiting period to receive comment before approval of
the land use application.

7.4. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS -
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
1. PURPOSE. The purpose of planned unit
development is to permit flexibility in
land use and to allow diversification in
the interrelationships of various uses and
structures with their sites and thus offers
an alternative method to the traditional
type of development. The application of
planned unit development concepts is
intended to encourage neighborhoods,
housing, design, open space, and
facilities compatible with the present
living environment in Price City as
described by the General Plan, while at
the same time insuring compliance with
practices which will assure the health,
safety and public welfare of the future
inhabitants of the planned unit
development, as well as maximizing the
energy utilization efficiency of the
project. In exchange for the additional
services provided by the developer in a
planned unit development, this chapter
will allow for increased intensity of
buildings and more flexible uses of the
land.
2. CONDOMINIUMS TO BE
DEVELOPED AS PLANNED UNIT
DEVELOPMENT. Where, in the opinion
of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
the unique features of a condominium
project (i.e., ownership, financing,
topography, types of land uses, etc.)
require more flexibility in design
solutions in order to protect the public
interest, the proposed condominium
project shall comply with the provisions
of this chapter. Any conflicting provision
of another ordinance adopted by Price
City may be waived by the Planning and
Zoning Commission with the approval of
the City Council when the performance
standards of the City are achieved.
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-11
3. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
TO MEET USE LIMITATIONS OF
ZONING DISTRICTS WHEREIN
LOCATED. No conditional use permit
for a planned unit development shall be
granted unless such development will
meet the use limitations of the zoning
district in which it is to be located,
including planned unit developments in
planned districts, and meet the density
and other limitations of such districts,
except as such requirements may be
lawfully modified (variance approved) as
provided by this chapter or by zoning
district regulations. Compliance with the
regulations of this Code in no sense
excuses the development from the
applicable requirements of the
subdivision regulations, except as
modifications thereof are specifically
authorized in the approval of the
application for the planned unit
development.
4. REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
1. No planned unit development shall
have an area less than that approved
by the Planning and Zoning
Commission as adequate for the

intensity of buildings and uses
shall be arranged around the
boundaries of the development.
2. Lot area, width, yard, height, set
back, and coverage requirements
shall be determined by approval
of the preliminary design plan.
3. Where feasible, buildings or
landscaping shall not
unreasonably prohibit the free
flow of air or direct exposure to
sunlight, specifically in regard to
solar heating and/or cooling
structures by solar energy
systems.

so as to provide solar access to
all of the residential units, unless
specifically waived by the
Planning and Zoning
Commission.
3. All plans must be prepared by a
qualified professional team, licensed
engineer, architect or land surveyor.
4. Ownership of private open space
reservations shall be established in a
manner acceptable to the City Council
and made a part of the conditions of
the plan approval.

of required open spaces within the
development shall be accomplished by:
1. Dedication of the land to Price City as
a public park or parkway system,
including a certificate of title
insurance; or
2. Granting to Price City a permanent
and perpetual open space easement on
and over the said private open spaces
to guarantee that the open space
remains perpetually in recreational or

7.6. LANDFILLS, GRADING
EXCAVATIONS, BACKFILLING AND
COMPACTION - SPECIAL
REQUIREMENTS
1. PURPOSE AND INTENT. This section
is adopted to promote public safety and
the general public welfare; to protect
property against loss from erosion, earth
movement, rock fall, landslide,
subsidence, collapse, cave-in, dust and
flooding; to maintain a superior
community environment; to provide for
the continued orderly growth of Price
City; and to insure the maximum
preservation of the natural scenic
character of major portions of Price City
by establishing minimum standards and
requirements relating to land grading,
excavations, and fills, and procedures by
which these standards and requirements
may be enforced. It is intended that this
section be administered with the
foregoing purposes in mind and
specifically in an attempt to:
1. Insure that the development of each
site occurs in a manner harmonious
with adjacent lands so as to minimize
problems of drainage, erosion, earth
movement and similar hazards.
2. Insure the public lands and places,
water courses, streets, and all other
lands in Price City are protected from
erosion, earth movement and drainage
hazards.
3. Insure that the planning, design and
construction of all development will
be done in a manner which provides
maximum safety and human
enjoyment and except where
specifically intended otherwise,
makes such construction as
unobtrusive in the natural terrain as
possible. Complete a geotechnical
report evaluating existing conditions,
develop recommendations for
earthwork activity and identify
precautions.
4. Insure, where practicable, the
maximum retention of natural
vegetation to aid in protection against
erosion, earth movement and other
hazards and to aid in preservation of
the natural scenic qualities of Price
City.

7-21
1. The Zoning Administrator, Building
Official, Building Inspector or City
Engineer shall make the inspections
hereinafter required and shall either
approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the
permittee wherein the same fails to
comply with this section. Where it is
found by inspection that conditions
are not substantially as stated or
shown in the conditional use permit
application, the inspector may stop
further work until and unless approval
is obtained for a revised grading plan
conforming to the existing conditions.
2. Plans for grading work, approved by

grading and excavation in or
contiguous to residential
neighborhoods shall be carried on
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to
7:00 p.m., 7 days a week. The Zoning
Administrator, City Engineer or
Building inspector may waive this
requirement if it is shown that
restricting the hours of operation
would unduly interfere with the
development of the property and it is
shown that other properties or
neighborhood values would not be
adversely affected.
3. DUST AND DIRT CONTROL. All
graded or disturbed surfaces of
excavations, and all equipment
materials and roadways on the site
shall be dampened or suitably treated,
managed, or contained to prevent
clouds of dust and the deposit of dust
on neighboring properties or streets;
all materials transported to or from
the site shall be so contained during
transportation as to prevent spillage
on street or other property outside of
the site. Tracking of mud and debris
by the wheels or tracks of vehicles
and equipment will be prevented by
setting up an area (drain rock pad) on
site for the vehicles and equipment to
drive over to loosen mud and debris.
Failure to control dust and dirt may
result in suspension or revocation of
conditional use permit(s) and/or
building permit(s).
4. SLOPES. The Zoning Administrator,
City Engineer or Building Inspector
may require the percent of slope of a
cut or fill to be reduced if it is found
that the cut or fill is subject to unusual
or excessive erosion, caving or
sliding, or if other conditions make
such requirements necessary for
stability. Steeper slopes may be
permitted where the material being
cut is unusually stable.
5. FILL MATERIAL. All fill, except in
publicly approved refuse disposal or
other landfill operations, shall be
earth, rock, or other inert materials
free from organic material, metal,
asphalt, petroleum products, toxins or
other hazardous materials, except that
topsoil spread on cut and fill surfaces
may incorporate humus for desirable
moisture retention and plant growth.
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-22
6. DRAINAGE. Drainage analysis,
reports, and plans, when required,
must comply with the Price City
Drainage Criteria. Adequate
provisions shall be made to prevent
any surface waters from damaging
any excavation or any portion of a fill
and adversely impacting adjacent
properties. Discharges shall comply,
when required, with the requirements
of the Utah Department of
Environmental Quality. Drainage
structures shall be constructed or
installed as necessary to prevent
erosion damage or to prevent
saturation of the fill or natural
material, at the foot of or behind cut
slopes and walls.
7. FINISHED CUTS AND SLOPES.
The exposed or finished cuts or slopes
of any fill or excavation shall be
smoothly graded. Exposed slopes of
any cut or fill shall be protected by
erosion control and approved
planting, crib walls, retaining walls,
fabrics or walls and planting,
terracing, or a combination thereof.
8. BACKFILL. Any pipe trench or
other trenching or excavation made in
any slope of any excavation or filled
site shall be back-filled in lifts and
compacted to the level of the
surrounding grade.
9. COMPACTION OF FILLS. Unless
otherwise directed by the Zoning
Administrator, City Engineer or
Building Inspector, all fills governed
by this Code intended to support
buildings, structures, or where
otherwise required to be compacted
for stability, shall be compacted,
inspected and tested in accordance
with the following provisions unless
otherwise dictated by a
geotechnical/soils report:
1. The natural ground surface shall
be prepared by removal of:
vegetation and, if necessary, shall
be graded to a series of terraces.
2. The fill shall be spread in a series
of layers, each not exceeding 12
inches in thickness, and shall be
compacted by sheepsfoot roller
compactor (after each layer is
spread) or other acceptable
method approved by the City
Engineer.
3. The moisture content of the fill
material shall be controlled at the
time of spreading and compaction
to obtain required maximum
density.
4. The fill material after compaction
shall have an average dry density
of not less than 95% of maximum
dry density and a minimum of
90% in all portions of the fill
requiring compaction as
determined by the AASHO Soil
Compaction Test Method T99-57
or T180-57, or other acceptable
testing method.
5. A written report of the
compaction, showing location,
boundaries and depth of test holes,
materials used, moisture
conditions, recommended soilbearing
pressures, and relative
density obtained from all tests,
prepared by a civil engineer or
soils engineer licensed by the
State of Utah shall be submitted to
the Zoning Administrator,
Building Inspector or Citys
Engineer.
6. The Zoning Administrator, City
Engineer or Building Inspector
may require additional tests or
information if, in their opinion,
the conditions or materials are
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-23
such that additional information is
necessary, and may modify or
delete any of the above-listed
requirements that in their opinion
are unnecessary to further the
purpose of this Code.
10. EROSION CONTROL AND
LANDSCAPING. All cut and fill
surfaces created by grading except for
firebreak purposes shall be planted
with a ground cover that is compatible
with the natural ground covers in
Price City. Topsoil is to be stockpiled
during rough grading and used on cut
and fill slopes. When slopes too steep
to support continuous ground cover
have been permitted and in lieu
thereof niches and ledges provided for
planting, such slopes need not be
planted with a continuous ground
cover, but may instead be screened
with vines and plantings. Cuts and
fills along public roads may be
required to be landscaped so as to
blend into the natural surroundings.
11. FILLING FOR AGRICULTURAL
AND FIRE PROTECTION
PURPOSES. Filling of the ground for
agricultural or fire protection
purposes shall be accomplished with
such practices as will prevent erosion
and damage to natural drainage
channels.
12. FINAL INSPECTION. If upon final
inspection of any grading it is found
that the work authorized by the
conditional use permit has been
satisfactorily completed in accordance
with the requirements of this Code
and any other requirements imposed,
the Zoning Administrator, City
Engineer or Building Inspector shall
so record in the record.
The Zoning Administrator, City
Engineer or Building Inspector shall
have the authority to revoke any
conditional use permit whenever it is
found that the work covered by the
certificate has been materially
extended or altered without prior
approval, or that any planting,
retaining walls, cribbing, drainage
structures, or other protective devices
as shown on the approved plans and
specifications submitted with the
application for a permit have not been
maintained in good order and repair.
Said revocation shall remain until the

existing sanitary sewer system is
more than 1/2 mile from the
boundary of the development and
shall be disapproved in any case
unless approved in writing by the
Building Official and the Health
Department. In order to
determine the adequacy of the
soil and geology involved to
properly absorb sewage effluent
and to determine the minimum
lot area required for such
installations, an interpretive map
based on the Natural Resources
Conservation Service Soil Survey
showing the suitability of the soil
for septic tank fields or pits shall
be submitted, along with the
results of percolation tests. The
results of these data will be

standards allowed by the
Building Official or the Health
Department shall not be
divided into building sites to be
served by soil absorption
sewage disposal systems.
4. Land rated as having severe
limitations for septic tank
absorption fields as defined by
the local county soil survey,
U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service shall not
be divided into building sites to
be serviced by soil absorption
sewage disposal systems unless
each such building site contains
not less than 20,000 square feet

additional development can
occur.
18. SANITARY SEWER MAINS,
LATERALS, AND HOUSE
CONNECTIONS - FUTURE. Where
local, county and regional master or
general plans indicate that
construction or extension of sanitary
sewers may serve the development
area within a reasonable time, the
Planning and Zoning Commission
may require the installation and
capping of sanitary sewer mains and
house connections by the developer,
in addition to the installation of
temporary individual on-lot sanitary
disposal systems by the developer or
lot purchaser. Whenever individual
on-lot sanitary sewage disposal
systems are proposed, the developer
shall either install such facilities or
require by deed restrictions or
otherwise as a condition of the sale of
each lot or parcel within such
development that on-lot sanitary
sewage disposal facilities be installed
by the purchaser of said lot at the time
the principal building is constructed,
and no building permit shall be issued
until such installation is assured. In
all other cases, sanitary disposal
facilities for sewage shall be provided

available for use in the
development in an amount
sufficient to meet minimum flows
of 250 gallons per person per day
plus outside irrigation and
minimum static pressures of 50
pounds per square inch (psi) with
a fire flow requirements of 1000
gal per minute. The minimum
pressure and flow may be
increased based on project
impact. There shall be adequate
water resources, treatment,
storage, transmission and
distribution to service the project.
2. In no event shall the quantity of
water provided by the developer
be less than that required to meet
minimum fire flow standards.
21. CULINARY WATER SYSTEM. The
culinary water delivery system shall
extend to the property line of every
lot and shall be capable of delivering

13. STORM DRAINAGE AND FLOOD
PLAINS
1. Complete drainage systems for the
entire development area shall be
designed by an engineer licensed in
the State of Utah and qualified to
perform such work, and shall be
shown on a drawing and shall be in
compliance with the Price City
Drainage Design Criteria. All
existing drainage features which are
to be incorporated in the design shall
be so identified. If the Final Plat is to
be presented in sections, a general
drainage plan for the entire area shall
be presented with the first section,
and appropriate development stages
for the drainage system for each
section indicated.
2. The drainage and flood plain systems
shall be designed to:
1. Permit the unimpeded flow of
natural water courses.
2. Ensure adequate drainage of all
low points.
3. Ensure compliance with
development in designated flood
plains in accordance with the
National Flood Insurance
Program, Rate Maps, City Flood
Plain Ordinance and in other
areas of suspected flooding.
1. Construction of buildings
shall not be permitted in a
known or formally designated
floodway.
2. Building construction may
occur in that portion of the
designated flood plain (flood
fringe) where the return
frequency is 100-years,
provided all usable floor
space is constructed above the
designated maximum
probable base flood elevation.
3. Where flow velocities in a
flood plain are generally
determined to be under 5 feet
per second and maximum
flood depth will not exceed 3
feet, such uses as cultivated
agriculture, nurseries, parks
and recreation facilities and
accessory parking may be
permitted. Warning signs
shall be posted and
maintained.
4. Any use of land is prohibited
where flooding would create
a public health hazard or
problem. This includes
shallow wells, non-cased
deep wells, sanitary landfills,
septic tank and on-lot sewage
disposal systems, water
treatment plants, and also
sewage disposal systems not
completely protected from
inundation.
5. Any contemplated flood plain
encroachment or channeling
shall be thoroughly analyzed
and its effect on stream flow
determined before such
encroachment is undertaken.
Any construction, dumping,
and filling operations in a
designated flood plain
constitute an encroachment
and must be approved by the
Planning Commission before
accomplishment.
4. The drainage basin as a whole
shall accommodate not only
runoff from the development area
but also, where applicable, the
system shall be designed to
accommodate the runoff from
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-39
those areas adjacent to and
upstream from the
development itself, as well as its
effects on lands downstream.
5. All proposed surface drainage
structures shall be indicated on
the plans.
6. All appropriate designs, details,
and dimensions needed to clearly
explain proposed construction
materials and elevations shall be
included in the drainage plans, to
include on-site detention.
Analysis and Design Criteria.
1. The rational method is to be
employed for watersheds less than
or equal to 10 acres. Peak rate and
volume calculations are to be based
on the 50 year 1 hour storm for the
storm drainage network. Use an
intensity of 1.10 inches per hour for
1 hour or other local reliable
precipitation data.
2. The Natural Resource Conservation
Service (NRCS) method is to be
used on watersheds larger than 10
acres. Peak rate and volume
calculations are to be based on the
100 year 24 hour storm event with
a type 2 distribution for the storm
drainage network.
3. Post development conditions shall
not exceed predevelopment
conditions. Check for the 5, 10, 25,
50 and 100 year storms and related
flood routing. Delineate the
watersheds for each catch basin and
inlet. Design the storm sewer pipe
network for the 50 year 1 hour
storm. Evaluate the effects of the
100 year storm. Runoff and
flooding shall be contained within
the streets and storm sewer pipeline
network.
4. Storm water detention basins, inlets
and outlets shall be designed for the
100 year storm event.
5. Each lot will be developed and
built upon such that there is a
positive grade away from all
structures. Property owners shall be
responsible for controlling drainage
runoff that is generated onsite and
impacts from offsite runoff. Onsite
detention shall be developed as
necessary. Discharge of runoff
from onsite shall be directed
towards approved street and natural
drainage ways.
6. Structures on lots shall not be built
with basement garage driveways or
basement stair accesses that
directly connect to the street.
7. Evaluation of potential pollution,
contamination and construction site
discharge through storm water
runoff from the facilities or features
of the development. The results of
the evaluation may require source
control, pre-treatment and pollution
prevention practices to be
implemented to control polluted
storm water runoff. Prepare and
submit a Storm Water Pollution
Protection Plan according to local
and/or State regulations.
8. On-site drainage shall not
negatively impact adjacent
properties or development.
Alteration to existing water
routes or channels shall not
impact adjacent properties or
development. Work within
mapped flood plain areas will
require a stream channel
alteration permit through the
State of Utah.
9. All necessary permits shall be
obtained from applicable local,
PRICE CITY
LAND USE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CODE CHAPTER 7
7-40
state, and federal agencies (i.e.
State Engineer, US Army Corps
of Engineers, State Division of
Health etc.)
10. All owners of real property within
the boundaries of Price City shall
keep all storm water collection,
conveyance and mitigation
structures, corridors, gutters,
canals, ditches, etc. free from
vegetation and debris to not
encumber storm water flows.
Failure to maintain such storm
water collection, conveyance and
mitigation structures, corridors,
gutters, canals, ditches, etc. free
from vegetation and debris shall
be a violation of this code.7

settings in which the pre-development
natural character of the landscape is
retained. Native plant species, wildlife
habitats, low water consumptive
landscapes, minimum vehicular traffic,
private lanes connected to public streets,
featured or gated entries, building
products produced from natural
materials, and quiet residential
conditions are also characteristic of this
zone. While much of this zone is
currently devoted to open land uses, it is
intended that the land shall be developed
into residential uses as the needs arise
having characteristics as herein above

10.17. ACCESSORY DWELLINGS.
1. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Section
is to establish use and development
regulations for accessory dwelling units
(ADU). These regulations are adopted
for the following purposes:
1. To allow City residents to house
elderly parents, disabled relatives,
and other family members or
students under conditions where

single-family residential
neighborhoods with minimal
impacts on the neighborhood in
terms of traffic, noise, parking,
congestion, and compatible scale and
appearance of residential buildings.
3. To prevent the proliferation of
multiple family rental dwellings,
absentee ownership, property
disinvestment, building code
violations, and associated decline in
quality of single-family residential
neighborhoods.
4. To establish uniform standards for
ADUs.
2. SCOPE. The requirements of this
Section shall apply to any approved
ADU within the City. Such
requirements shall not be constructed to
prohibit or limit other applicable
provisions of the Land Use Development
and Management Code, and other laws.

12.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
1. The purpose of the SA overlay district is to
designate and describe those areas within the
municipality that possess physical and/or
environmental characteristics which require
special public consideration of use
applications which might affect the structure
or the land, the management of surface or
subsurface water, safety of future land
occupants due to increased fire, earthquake,
rock fall, flooding or storm hazards within
the proposed development, or the
uneconomic extension of public facilities and
services. Of specific concern is development
in flood prone areas, earthquake zones,
landslide areas, areas of steep slope or
unstable soils, rock fall, wetlands, and other
sensitive areas requiring careful assessment
prior to alteration.
1. It is the intent of these regulations to
permit the widest possible latitude in the
use of property, while at the same time
requiring design solutions which will
avoid detrimental impacts on sensitive
natural areas, as well as provide
protection from adverse natural forces
and hazards.
12.2 PERMITTED USES.
The following uses are permitted in the SA
overlay district:
1. Tilling of the soil
2. Raising of crops
3. Horticulture and gardening, excluding
agricultural industries.
12.3 CONDITIONAL USES.
The SA overlay district is an overlay district
whose sole effect is to require additional review
of proposed uses in the underlying districts. To
this end, any permitted use in a district overlaid
by an SA overlay district, with the exception of
those uses permitted in section 13.2 above, is a
conditional use. Conditional uses authorized in
districts overlaid by the SA overlay district
remain conditional uses.
12.4 GENERAL.
The Sensitive Area District, SA zoning
district, if not marked on the zoning map per se,
shall nonetheless include areas of Price City
designated as:
1. 100 year mapped flood plain according to
the National Flood Insurance Program.
2. Geologic hazards areas including
earthquake areas/faults, unstable soil
conditions, subsidence, slopes in excess
of 25%, rock fall areas, cliffs, unstable
slopes and areas subject to flooding.
3. Areas of high water table and ground
water including wetlands, high water
table, perched water, floodway, drainage
ways and swampy conditions.
4. Areas adjacent to or within one-hundred
feet (100) of any high pressure natural
gas transmission line. Inspection by a
qualified provider and the Price City
engineer must accompany any
development plans, utility installations or

APPROVAL.
After public hearing following required legal
notice, the City Council may by ordinance
establish a PL District, provided that it finds that
the facts submitted with the application and
presented at the hearing establish:
1. The proposed PL District or a given unit
thereof can be substantially completed
within two years of the establishment of
the PL District.
2. Each phase of the development, as well
as the total development, can exist as an
independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and
stability, or that adequate assurance will
be provided that such objective will be
attained; and that the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and
potential surrounding uses, but will have
a beneficial effect which could not be
achieved under other zoning districts.
3. The streets proposed are suitable and
adequate to carry anticipated traffic, and
increased densities will not generate
traffic in such amounts as to overload the
street network outside the PL District.
4. Commercial development can be justified
economically at the locations proposed, if
any, to provide commercial facilities.
5. The area surrounding said development
can be planned and zoned in coordination
and substantial compatibility with the
proposed development.

number or letter to identify it and the approved
concept plan shall be adopted by reference and
become part of this code.
13.6 REVERT TO ORIGINAL ZONING.
1. If no development has occurred to
effectuate a PL District development
within 2 years after the district has been
created, the Planning Commission shall
review the action and determine whether
or not the continuation of a given PL
District is in the public interest. If the
Planning Commission so recommends,
the City Council may order that the area
revert to the original zoning district from
which it was created, without a public
hearing.
2. If the land within a PL District is sold to
new owner(s), the Planning Commission
or the City Council shall require the new
owner(s) to accept in writing all
obligations and guarantees required by
the Preliminary Design Plan of the
original owner(s). In the event that such
agreement is not provided, the governing
body may, without public hearing, return
the zoning of the PL District to the
original zoning district which existed
prior to creation of the PL Districts.
3. If the owner(s) or developer of the PL
District is unwilling or unable to carry
out the requirements of the Preliminary
Design Plan because claimed adequate
water supplies, waste water disposal,
streets, or other major elements of
approval cannot or will not be provided
as required, the City Council may stop all
development in the district until such
failure has been remedied or may
terminate the PL District and revert back
to the original zoning district which
existed prior to creation of the PL
District, without waiting for the 2 year
