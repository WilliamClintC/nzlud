4-3-1 Adoption. The Annexation Policy Plan
(herein referred to as the Plan) was adopted by
Resolution of the Clinton City Council, Resolution
Number 15-03, dated April 22, 2003, as required by
Section 10-2-401.5 of the Utah Code.
History: 11/09

4-3-3 Purpose of the Plan. The Plan is
established to be a guide for making decisions
regarding the future annexation of unincorporated
lands into the boundaries of the City of Clinton.
History: 11/09
4-3-4 Plan Preparation and Adoption. The
Preparation of the Plan began on December 17, 2002,
with a workshop of the Clinton City Planning
Commission, City Council and City staff. At this
workshop, participants assisted in determining the
specific criteria necessary to guide the Citys
decisions to grant future annexation petitions, as
outlined in the Utah Code. A review of the first draft
of the plan was held by the Planning Commission on
January 21, 2003, after which the dates for two public
hearings were scheduled.
History: 11/09
4-3-5 Public Hearings. The first public hearing
was held by the Planning Commission on March 18,
and was continued on April 1, 2003. The City
Council held a public hearing on April 8, 2003,

4-4-3 How the Services will be Financed
4-4-4 An Estimate of the Tax Consequences to
Residents
4-4-1 Need for Municipal Services in
Unincorporated Areas.
(1) The unincorporated areas to be considered for
annexation into the City are located within Davis
County. The expansion area is identified generally as
being north and west of the current City boundaries,
extending westward.
(2) The need for municipal services in this area
would most likely hinge on accommodating
development desiring to become a part of the City.
Future needs for community growth will encompass a
variety of land uses, including low to medium density
residential, some commercial near the areas of the
proposed Legacy Highway, and open space and
wetlands.
History: 11/09, 12/09
4-4-2 Plan for Extension of Municipal Services.
(1) Community growth in the identified annexation
area would require the extension of full municipal
services. These services and infrastructure will be
extended into areas on an as-needed basis. The Plan
contains a review of the municipal services and their
providers as well as the current status and their ability
for extension. The Plan should be referred to
whenever considering the affect of extending services
to facilitate an annexation petition.
(2) Currently sewer services in the annexation area
are handled through septic tank, which limits the
potential for significant growth in the area. The
development of the sewer lift station in the City has
made it possible for some land west of the station to
connect to the station. However, a complete
evaluation of the capacity and capabilities of the
station will be necessary.
(3) Concerns for drainage and flooding will also exist
in the designated area for annexation. Natural and
storm drainage channels and canals in the area will
require extension. Ground water issues will need to
be evaluated and may necessitate a ban on basement
construction methods.
History: 11/09
4-4-3 How the Services will be Financed.
(1) Financing of infrastructure expansion will, for the
most part, be paid by the developers of the properties
requiring the expansion. Properties in the
unincorporated Davis County area will be required to
be annexed into the City in order to be connected to
the municipal services.
(2) The City may elect to participate in the financing
of some City facilities which will improve service to
existing development. These costs will be met by
various means. The City may chose to use general
funds, impact fees, special improvement districts,
bonding, grants or other financial means.
History: 11/09, 12/09
4-4-4 An Estimate of the Tax Consequences to
Residents.
(1) Property taxes from residential properties
generally do not cover the full costs of providing
services to those residences. If all annexation areas
are developed solely as residential, the annexation of
these properties will result in an increase to the Citys
burden of paying for the services required by the
development. To decrease the tax burden, areas near
the proposed Legacy Highway corridor have been
identified for potential commercial uses.
(2) The Plan has an example of comparison of tax
rates for property within the City and property in the
unincorporated portion of the County in the Plan
area. A similar study, for both residential and
commercial, would need to be accomplished at the
time of application review to accurately evaluate the
increase upon properties being annexed into the City.

(1) All applications for building permits with the
potential of damaging improvements within the
public right-of-way or that may result in a request for
occupancy prior to completion of all improvements,
shall be accompanied by a Permit Completion and
Off-site Improvement Protection Agreement,
hereinafter referred to as a Bond Agreement to
assure project completion and the maintenance of
Off-site improvements. The requirement for a bond
shall be at the determination of the Building Official.
The Bond Agreement shall be prepared by the
Community Development Department and signed by
the owner or his authorized representative (referred to
as Builder) of the property to be improved. The
bond shall be in a sum set by resolution of the City
Council or by determining the cost of the
improvements, whichever is greater. The purpose of
the bond shall be to assure the satisfactory
completion of the project as well as maintaining the
satisfactory condition of the curb, gutter, sidewalk,
drive approach, landscaping, paving, patching,
asphalt cut, and other public improvement (protected
items) theretofore installed on and in close proximity
to the individual property for which the building
permit was sought. The Bond Agreement shall
terminate and the bond is released after satisfactory
completion of the project and the protected items are
inspected and found to be not damaged or are
installed to meet city standards. Inspection of the
protected items shall be done by the Clinton City
Public Works Department. Additionally, the building
permit must be closed by the Community
Development Department with issuance of a
certificate of occupancy or other notification of
passing a final inspection by the city Building
Official.
(2) After the final inspection of the protected items, if
the structure for which the permit was issued is
habitable and any non-compliance items were noted
on the inspection form, this form shall be referred to
as the Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO).
The building inspector will provide a copy of the
TCO to Builder. Builder shall make the necessary
repairs within 120 days of receipt of the TCO.
(3) In the event the TCO is not cleared and a
Certificate of Occupancy or other certification of
completion of the building permit is not issued within
120 days after issuance of the TCO, the Bond
Agreement shall terminate and Builder shall have no
further claim upon the Bond. The Building Official
may grant one extension, not to exceed, ninety (90)
days to this Agreement when the Builder and
structure owner have indicated they have an
agreeable schedule for completion of the noncompliance
items.
(4) Once the Bond Agreement is terminated, the
current owner of the property may submit a Clinton
City Indemnification Request/Agreement to the
Community Development Department for
consideration by the Building Official. Upon the
approval of the Indemnification Request/Agreement
by the Building Official and the completion of all
items noted on the TCO by the current owner, the
Bond may be released to the current owner. The
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 5 Building Regulations
current owner must complete all items noted on the
TCO within 90-days of approval of the
Indemnification Request/Agreement by the Building
Official. The Building Official may grant one
extension, not to exceed, ninety (90) days to this
Agreement when the owner has explained
extenuating circumstances and presented a timeline
for completion of the non-compliance items.
(5) The City may file a Certificate of Notice of Non-
Compliance, in accordance with Chapter 7, of this
Title, with the Davis County Recorders Office, if the
requirements outlined in the Bond Agreement or
Indemnification Request/Agreement are not met by
the Builder/owner.
(6) The City may file a complaint with the State
Division of Professional Licensing against the
Builder for failure to complete a project associated
with an issued building permit.
(7) Nothing in this ordinance or any agreement
established by this ordinance prohibits the City from
requiring the Builder to provide proof that an escrow
account, in the name of the purchaser of Lot and
associated structure related to the issued permit, to
secure the completion of any items that the Building
Official feels are not covered by the amount of the
bond established by the Bond Agreement.
(8) In the event that no certificate of occupancy has
been issued within the time period established in the
Bond Agreement or Indemnification
Request/Agreement these agreements will be
considered terminated and all funds being held by the
City will be forfeited to the City to cover costs
associated with repairs to public improvements and
this process. Nothing in this ordinance or any
agreement established by this ordinance is intended to
imply that the City will complete items on the TCO
associated with anything other than public
improvements and infrastructure.
History: 1/09
5-1-12 Release of Funds. Funds held by the Bond
Agreement shall be released to the individual/party
indicated on the Bond Agreement, through a properly
executed Indemnification Request/Agreement as
approved by the Building Official or through
forfeiture to the City.

5-1-13 Liability for Damages. This ordinance
shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the
responsibility of any person owning, operating or
controlling any building or structure for any damages
to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the
code enforcement agency or its parent jurisdiction be
held as assuming any such liability by reason of the
inspections authorized by this code or any permits or
certificates issued under the technical codes adopted
by the State of Utah Building Commission this

adjacent to a parcel may vary greatly depending upon
the type of improvement, material of which it is
constructed, and age of the improvements. Upon
activation of a Declaration by application for a permit
the Director may review all recorded Declarations on a
parcel proposed for development to evaluate the value
of a Declaration prior collection of funds or issuance of
a permit. Prior to requiring payment the following may
be considered in evaluating the value of an
improvement to a developer.

given when calculating charges.

amount of fees required to facilitate the actions
outlined in this Chapter, from time to time, by
resolution and published in the Clinton City

another general clean-up will take place during which
all remaining natural flowers will be disposed of and

design requirement, or the level of safety, service,
and quality intended by the Standards and
Specifications minimum requirements.
1.24 Construction Specification Tolerances: A
document entitled CONSTRUCTION
SPECIFICATION TOLERANCES listed under
Appendix 1 of this document contains the allowable

shall be kept free from water during excavation, fine
grading, pipe laying and jointing, and pipe
embedment operations. Where the trench bottom is
mucky or otherwise unstable because of the presence
of groundwater, and in all cases where the static
groundwater is above the bottom of any trench or bell
hole excavation, such groundwater shall be lowered
to the extent necessary to keep the trench free from
water and the trench bottom stable when the work
within the trench is in progress. The discharge from
excavation dewatering shall be conducted to natural
drainage channels, gutters, drains, or storm sewers.
The discharge from excavation dewatering shall be
filtered through straw bails or other median, to
remove silts and debris prior to entering natural
drainage channels, gutters, drains, or storm sewers.
No sanitary sewer shall be used for disposal of trench
water. Surface water shall be prevented from entering
trenches.
4.06 Trench Excavation: Excavation for
pipelines shall be located as shown on the Drawings
or as staked in the field. Trenches shall be excavated
to the depths and widths required to accommodate
the construction of the pipelines, as follows:
(1) Normal Excavation: Except in ledge-rock,
cobbles, stones, or water-saturated earth, mechanical
excavation of trenches shall not extend below the
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
TRENCH EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL
42
bottom of the pipe after placement in its final
position.
(2) Authorized Over-Excavation:
(a) Where ledge-rock, cobble rock, stones or other
material render the trench material unsuitable for pipe
bedding, as determined by the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer, bedding material shall be
imported and placed. The trench shall be excavated to
a minimum of four-inches (4) below the bottom of
the pipe after placement in its final position.
(b) Where unstable material is encountered in the
excavation, foundation material may be required, as
determined by the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer. In such cases, a minimum of
eight inches (8") below the bottom of the pipe after
placement in its final position shall be removed.
Over-excavation not ordered, specified, or shown
shall be considered to be unauthorized excavation.
(3) Unauthorized Over-Excavation: Any excavation
carried below the elevation required to install the
pipe as specified in these Specifications, or directed
by the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer, shall be
considered to be unauthorized. Such excavation shall
be backfilled in accordance with these Specifications
for "Imported Granular Material" and "Gravel
Foundation for Pipelines and Pipeline Structures," all
at the Developer/Contractor's expense.
(4) Trench Width:
(a) The trench shall be excavated such that the pipe is
always centered in the trench. The minimum clear
trench width at the horizontal diameter of the pipe
must not be less than the outside diameter of the pipe
plus twelve inches (12"). The maximum clear width
of trench at the top of the pipe must not be more than
the outside diameter of the pipe plus eighteen inches
(18"). If a trench is excavated to a greater width, the
Developer/Contractor will be required to restore the
trench to an acceptable condition by following the
steps outlined in these Specifications for "Trenches in
Embankments."
(b) Trench width for pipeline structures, valves, or
other accessories shall be sufficient to leave at least
twelve inches (12") clear between their outer surfaces
and the trench. Backfill with earth under structures or
valves will not be permitted. Any unauthorized
excess excavation below the elevation indicated for
foundation of any structures shall be backfilled in
accordance with these specifications for "Imported
Granular Materials," and "Gravel Foundation for Pipe
& Pipeline Structures," at the Developer/Contractor's
expense.
(5) Trenches in Embankments: Before laying pipes
that are to be in fill or embankment areas, the
embankment shall first be placed and compacted to
the specified density to a depth of not less than two
feet (2') above the top of the proposed pipe. After
placing and compacting the embankment, the trench
for the pipe or conduit shall be excavated through the
fill and fine graded and the pipe installed as
specified.
(6) Placement of Excavated Material:
(a) All excess material shall be hauled away from the
construction site and disposed of in an area obtained
by the Developer/Contractor and approved by the
Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer. The
Developer/Contractor shall be responsible for all
rights-of-way, easements, and access associated with
the disposal of excess excavated material. It shall
further be responsible to obtain permission from the
property owner or person controlling the property
where the Developer/Contractor plans to dispose of
excavated material. No compensation will be made to
the Developer/Contractor for disposal of excess
excavated material.
(b) Non-excess excavated material shall be piled in a
manner that will not endanger the work and will
avoid obstructing sidewalks and driveways. Gutters
and irrigation ditches shall be kept clear or other
satisfactory provisions shall be made for street
drainage and continuity of irrigation.
(c) Grading of the area surrounding the trenches,
including excavated materials, shall be performed as
necessary to prevent surface water from flowing into
trenches, or other excavations. Control of
groundwater shall be as specified in section 3.05,
Control of Groundwater.
(7) Fine Grading the Trench Bottom: The bottom of
the trench shall be accurately graded and prepared to
provide uniform bearing and support on undisturbed
soil or compacted granular bedding at every point
along the entire length of the pipe. Bell holes shall be
hand excavated after the trench bottom has been fine
graded. Bell holes shall be only large enough to
permit making the joints and to assure that any
portion of the joint or bell does not support the pipe.
4.07 Trench Backfill:
(1) Trench backfill for piping consists of four zones:
foundation, bedding, initial backfill, and final
backfill. Pipe embedment is a commonly used
term that refers to the region including the bedding
and initial backfill zones, or any region within one
foot (1) of any pipe, pipeline structure, or accessory.
The foundation is defined as the region below four
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
TRENCH EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL
43
inches (4) below the bottom of the pipe. The
bedding is defined as the region between four inches
(4) below the bottom of the pipe and the bottom of
the pipe. The initial backfill is defined as the region
between the bottom of the pipe and twelve inches
(12) above the top of the pipe. The final backfill is
defined as the region above twelve inches (12)
above the pipe.
(2) All fill materials shall be compacted as specified
in this section.
(3) Excavated materials are not satisfactory for
foundation, bedding, or backfill, when located within
the public right-of-way or where established during
the plan review process. The Developer/Contractor
shall be responsible for providing imported granular
material.
(4) Use of excavated materials as backfill shall
require that a proctor be accomplished on excavated
materials. Due to the constant changing nature of the
soil within the area the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer may require a new proctor be
accomplished anytime there is an apparent change in
the composition of the soil. The
Developer/Contractor shall be responsible for paying
for all soils engineering and testing.
(5) Imported Granular Material: Imported granular
material for foundation, bedding, and backfill shall be
cleaned crushed rock or gravel, free from sod,
vegetation, and other organic or deleterious material.

No. 200 sieve.
(b) Foundation Placement:
(i) When the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer
authorizes over-excavation, foundation material shall
be placed in the foundation zone. The foundation
material shall be placed so that the trench can be
properly fine graded as specified. The foundation
material shall be deposited over the entire trench
width and compacted in layers. The layers shall have
a maximum uncompacted thickness of six-inches
(6).
(ii) The material shall then be fine graded in
accordance with the specification for Fine Grading in
§ 4.06(7) above.
(c) Pipe Embedment: Embedment material for other
than PVC pipe shall have no material larger than one
and one half-inch (1 ½) in any dimension. For PVC
pipe, the material must be sand.
(i) Bedding: The bedding material shall be deposited
over the entire trench width to a compacted thickness
of no less than four inches (4). The material shall
have a maximum uncompacted thickness of six
inches (6).
(ii) Initial Backfill: After the pipe is in place, initial
backfill material shall be placed at any point below
the mid-point of the pipe simultaneously and
uniformly on both sides of the pipe in un-compacted
layers not to exceed ten-inches (10) or one-half the
diameter of the pipe, whichever is less. Initial backfill
material shall be placed with care to prevent
displacement of or damage to the pipe during the
embedment process. Initial backfill material shall be
scattered alongside the pipe and not dropped into the
trench in compact masses.
(iii) That section of the pipe zone from the mid-point
of the pipe to twelve inches (12) above the top of the
pipe shall then be filled with initial backfill materials
and compacted.
(d) Final Backfill: Final backfill shall be from twelve
inches (12") above the top of the pipe to the level
shown on the Drawings. Excavated materials
consisting of fines, sand, and gravel shall be used for
final backfill. No oil cake, bituminous pavement,
concrete, rock, or other lumpy material shall be used
in the final backfill unless these materials are
scattered and do not exceed six inches (6") in any
dimension. Perishable or spongy material shall not
be used in final backfilling.
(e) Compaction: Backfill shall be compacted by
means of sheepsfoot rollers, pneumatic tire rollers,
vibrating rollers, or mechanical tampers.
(i) Under pavements or other surface improvements
the in-place density shall be a minimum of ninety-six
percent (96%) of laboratory standard the maximum
dry density as determined by AASHTO T-99. In
shoulders and other areas the in-place density shall be

for final backfill.
(iii) Prior to compaction each layer shall be evenly
spread, moistened, and worked by disk harrowing or
other equivalent means.
(iv) If the required density is not attained, test
sections will be required to determine any
adjustments in compaction equipment, thickness of
layers, moisture content and compactive effort
necessary to attain the specified minimum density.
(v) Approval of equipment, thickness of layers,
moisture content, and compactive effort shall not be
deemed to relieve the Developer/Contractor of the
responsibility for attaining the specified minimum
densities. The Developer/Contractor, in planning its
work, shall allow sufficient time to perform the work
connected with test sections and to permit the Public
Facilities Inspector/Engineer to make tests for
relative densities.

the repairs have been made to the satisfaction of the
Owner. A copy of said release shall be delivered to
the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer.
4.09 Restoration of Construction Site: During
the progress of the Work, the Developer/Contractor
shall clean up all construction debris, excess
excavation, and excess materials, and shall restore all
fences, irrigation structures, ditches, culverts, and
similar items. The Developer/Contractor shall
stockpile the excavated trench material so as to do the
least damage to adjacent grassed areas, or fences,
regardless of whether these are on private property or
public rights-of-way. All excavated materials shall
be removed from grassed and planted areas and these
surfaces shall be left in a conditions equivalent to
their original surface and free from all rocks, gravel,
boulders, or other foreign materials.
4.10 Developer/Contractor's Responsibility:

pressure. A leakage test shall be conducted
concurrently with the pressure test.
(a) Test Pressure Restrictions: Test pressures shall:
(i) Be two (2) times the normal operating pressure as
determined by the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer;
(ii) Not exceed pipe or thrust restraint design
pressures;
(iii) Be of at least 2-hour duration;
(iv) Not vary by more than plus or minus five (+ 5)
psi for the duration of the test;
(v) Not exceed twice the rated pressure of the valves
or hydrants when the pressure boundary of the test
section includes closed gate valves or hydrants;
(vi) Not exceed the rated pressure of the valves when
the test boundary of the test section includes closed,
resilient-seated gate valves or butterfly valves.
(b) Pressurization: Each valved section of pipe shall
be slowly filled with water and the specified test
pressure, based on the elevation of the lowest point of
the line or section under test and corrected to the
elevation of the test gage, shall be applied by means
of a pump connected to the pipe in a manner
satisfactory to the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer.
(c) Air Removal: Before applying the specified test
pressure, air shall be expelled completely from the
pipe, valves, and hydrants. If permanent air vents are
not located at all high points, the
Developer/Contractor shall install corporation cocks
at such points so that the air can be expelled as the
line is filled with water. After all the air has been
expelled, the corporation cocks shall be closed and
the test pressure applied. At the conclusion of the
pressure test, the corporation cocks shall be removed
and plugged.
(d) Examination: All exposed pipe, fittings, valves,
hydrants, and joints shall be examined carefully

pipe materials and installation in sanitary sewer,
storm drain, and other gravity line construction.
6.02 PIPE:
Concrete pipe used in sewer line, storm drain line and
other gravity line construction shall be reinforced
concrete pipe or non-reinforced concrete pipe, as
required by design loading and fill heights and as
follows:
1. Reinforced Concrete Pipe:
All reinforced concrete pipe used in the
construction shall be of the rubber gasket type,
bell and spigot joint design, conforming to the
requirements of the latest revision of ASTM
Designation C-76. Pipe class shall be as shown
on the Drawings. The minimum joint length of
all pipes provided shall be 7 1/2 feet. All pipe 12-
inch diameter and larger shall be reinforced
concrete.
2. Non-Reinforced Concrete Pipe:
All non-reinforced concrete pipe used in the

3. Bell and Spigot Joints:
Bell and spigot joints, including rubber gaskets,
shall conform to the requirements of the latest
revision of ASTM Designation C-443. The pipe
joint shall be so designed as to provide for
self-centering, and when assembled, to compress
the gasket to form a watertight seal. The gasket
shall be confined in a groove on the spigot, so that
pipe movement or hydrostatic pressure cannot
displace the gasket.
4. Minimum Size and Slope Requirements:
In no case shall sanitary sewer mains be less than
eight (8) inches in diameter or storm drain lines
less than fifteen (15) inches in diameter.
Exception: Storm drainpipes servicing a single
curb inlet box may be twelve (12) inches in
diameter if the flow does not exceed the pipe size.
Concrete pipe shall be laid with uniform slope
between manholes. All concrete pipes shall be
designed and constructed to give mean velocities
of not less than 2 feet per second when flowing
full, based on Mannings formula using an n
value of .013. Absolute minimum slope allowed
shall be those published by the Utah Department
of Environmental Quality, Division of Water
Quality as Administrative Rules for Design
Requirements for Wastewater Collection,
Treatment and Disposal System, R317-3, Table
R317-3-2.3 (D)(4) Minimum Slopes.
Whenever possible the slope should exceed 0.005
ft/ft. The pipe should be sized to meet anticipated
hydraulic loads, increasing the pipe size to reduce
the minimum slope requirements shall not be
allowed. Sewer slopes shall not exceed 0.12 ft/ft,
drop manholes shall be used when steeper slopes
are needed, drop manholes shall be used to keep
line grade below maximum grade allowed.
6.03 PIPE LAYING:
All concrete pipe installation shall proceed up grade
on a stable foundation, with joints closely and
accurately fitted. Rubber gaskets shall be fitted
properly in place, and care shall be taken in joining
the pipe units to avoid twisting of gaskets. Joints
shall be clean and dry, and a joint lubricant as
recommended by the pipe supplier shall be applied
uniformly to the mating joint surfaces to facilitate
easy positive joint closure.
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
CONCRETE PIPE
62
Pipe shall be installed with uniform bearing under the
full length of the barrel, with suitable excavations
being made to receive pipe bells.
Select material shall be compacted around the pipe to
firmly bed the pipe in position. If adjustment of
position of a pipe length is required after being laid, it
shall be removed and re-jointed as for a new pipe.
When laying is not in progress, the ends of the pipe
shall be closed with a tight-fitting stopper to prevent
the entrance of foreign material.
In addition to the above requirements, all pipe
installation shall comply with the specific
requirements of the pipe manufacturer.
6.04 GRAVEL FOUNDATION FOR PIPE:
Wherever the subgrade material does not afford a
sufficiently solid foundation to support the pipe and
superimposed load, or where groundwater must be
drained, the subgrade shall be excavated to such
depth as may be necessary and replaced with crushed
rock or gravel compacted into place.
Gravel for concrete pipe foundation shall be clean
crushed rock or gravel with one hundred percent
(100%) passing a one-inch (1") screen and five
percent (5%) passing a No. 4 sieve.

defined line and grade with the following limits:
Variance from established line and grade shall not be
greater than one-sixteenth (1/16) inch per inch of
pipe diameter in ten feet, and not to exceed one-half
inch in ten feet, provided that such variation does not
result in a level or reverse sloping invert; provided
also that variation in the invert elevation between
adjoining ends of pipe, due to non-concentricity of
joining surface and pipe interior surfaces, does not
exceed one-sixty-fourth (1/64) inch per inch of pipe
diameter, or one-half (1/2) inch maximum.
6.06 SPRING LINE:
All pipes shall be backfilled to the spring line with
imported fill no greater than one and one-half inch (1
½) in size.
6.07 PIPE BEDDING:

Earth fill for foundations shall have unsuitable
materials, such as weeds, sod, roots larger than
1/4-inch in diameter, vegetation, or other organic
material removed by clearing, stripping, and/or
grubbing. Except as otherwise specified, earth
foundation surfaces shall be graded to remove
surface irregularities and shall be scarified
parallel to the axis of the fill or otherwise
acceptably scored and loosened to a minimum
depth of six inches. The moisture content of the
loosened material shall be controlled as specified
for the earth fill, and the surface materials of the
foundation shall be compacted and bonded with
the first layer of earth fill as specified for
subsequent layers of earth fill.
Earth abutment surfaces shall be free of loose,
uncompacted earth in excess of 2 inches in depth
normal to the slope and shall be at such moisture
content that the earth fill can be compacted
against them to affect a good bond between the
fill and the abutments.
Rock foundation and abutment surfaces shall be
cleared of all loose material by hand or other
effective means and shall be free of standing
water when fill is placed upon them. Occasional
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
EARTHWORK

rock outcrops in earth foundations for earth fill,
except in dams and other structures designed to
restrain the movement of water, shall not require
special treatment if they do not interfere with
compaction of the foundation and initial layers of
the fill or the bond between the foundation and
the fill.
2. Placement:
Fill shall not be placed until the required
excavation and foundation preparation have been
completed and the foundation has been inspected
and approved by the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer and any Regulatory Agency
having authority over the project. Fill shall not be
placed upon a frozen surface, nor shall snow, ice,
or frozen material be incorporated in the fill.
Fill shall be placed in approximately horizontal
layers. The thickness of each layer before
compaction shall not exceed the maximum
thickness specified. Materials placed by dumping
in piles or windrows shall be spread uniformly to
not more than the specified thickness before being
compacted. Hand compacted fill, including fill
compacted by manually directed power tampers,
shall be placed in layers whose thickness before
compaction is not greater than four (4) inches.
All rock whose greatest dimension is larger than
two-inch (2") shall be removed from the material
receiving compaction by manually directed power
tampers.
Earth fill designed to restrain the movement of
water shall be placed so as to meet the following
additional requirements:
a. The distribution of materials throughout
each zone shall be essentially uniform, and the
fill shall be free from lenses, pockets, streaks,
or layers of material differing substantially in
texture or gradation from the surrounding
material.
b. If the surface of any layer becomes too
hard and smooth for proper bond with the
succeeding layer, it shall be scarified parallel
to the axis of the fill, to a depth of not less
than 2 inches before the next layer is placed.
c. The top surfaces of embankments shall be
maintained approximately level during
construction, except that a crown or crossslope
of not less than 2 percent shall be
maintained to ensure effective drainage, and
except as otherwise specified for drain fill
zones. If the Drawings or specifications
require or the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer directs that fill be placed at
a higher level in one part of the embankment
than another is, the top surface of each part
shall be maintained as specified above.
d. Dam embankments shall be constructed
in continuous layers from abutment to
abutment except where openings to facilitate
construction of inlet and outlet pipes are
specifically authorized in the contract.
e. Embankments built at different levels as
described in 3 and 4 shall be constructed so
that the slope of the bonding surfaces between
the embankment in place and embankment to
be placed is not steeper than 2 feet horizontal
to 1-foot vertical. The bonding surface of the
embankment in place shall be stripped of all
loose material, scarified, moistened and
recompacted when the new fill is placed
against it. This is needed to ensure a good
bond with the new fill, to obtain the specified
moisture content and specified density at the
junction of the in-place and new fill.
3. Borrow:
When the embankment or fill exceeds the amount
of excavation, sufficient additional material shall
be obtained from borrow pits provided by the
Developer/Contractor. All material proposed to
be imported shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer prior to starting of hauling
operations.
The materials used for embankment and fill
construction shall be free from sod, grass, roots
larger than 1/4-inch diameter, trash, clods, rocks
larger than six inches in diameter, and all other
material unsuitable for construction of compacted
fills. Rotomilled asphalt meeting the large rock
requirement may be used as borrow.
Grading of completed embankments and fills
shall bring the surfaces to a smooth, uniform
condition with final grades being within 0.1 foot
of the design grade.
12.06 COMPACTION OF MATERIALS:
The material shall be deposited in horizontal layers
having a thickness of not more than eight-inches (8")
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
EARTHWORK
123
prior to being compacted as hereinafter specified.
The distribution of materials shall be such that the
compacted material will be homogeneous and free
from lenses, pockets, or other imperfections.
During placement and compaction of fill, the
moisture content of the materials being placed shall
be maintained within the specified range, and the
moisture content shall be uniform throughout the
layers. Disking, blading or other approved methods
prior to compaction of the layer shall obtain uniform
moisture distribution. The moisture shall be
controlled at a level to permit compaction of the fill
as specified, but in no case greater or less than two
percent plus or minus of the optimum moisture as
determined by AASHTO T-99.
The application of water to the fill materials shall be
accomplished at the borrow areas insofar as
practicable. Water may be applied by sprinkling the
materials after placement on the fill, if necessary.
Material that is too wet when deposited on the fill
shall either be removed or dried to specified moisture
content prior to compaction.
If the top surface of the preceding layer, a foundation
or abutment surface in the zone of contact with the
fill becomes too dry to permit suitable bond it shall
be scarified and moistened by sprinkling to the
required moisture content prior to placement of the
next layer of fill.
When the material has been conditioned as here in
before specified the backfill or embankment shall be
compacted to a minimum of 96% of maximum dry
density as determined by AASHTO T-99.
Densification of earth fill shall be performed by
equipment designated solely for that purpose. Each
layer of fill shall be compacted as necessary to make
the density of the fill matrix not less than the
minimum density specified. The fill matrix is
defined as the portion of the fill material finer than
the maximum particle size used in the compaction
test method specified.
1. Under Roadways:
Under roadways and extending one foot beyond
the proposed curb-line the fill or embankment
material shall be compacted to a minimum of
96% of maximum density specified above.
2. Under Sidewalks and Driveways:
Under sidewalks and driveways extending one
foot each side of the edge of slab the fill or
embankment material shall be compacted to a
minimum of 96% of maximum density specified
above.
12.07 REMOVAL AND PLACEMENT OF
DEFECTIVE FILL:
Fill placement at densities lower than the specified
minimum density or at moisture contents outside the
specified acceptable range of moisture content or
otherwise not conforming to the requirements of the
specifications shall be reworked to meet the
requirements or removed and replaced with
acceptable fill. The replacement fill and the
foundation, abutment and fill surfaces upon which it
is place shall conform to all requirements of this
specification for foundation preparation, approval,
placement, moisture control and compaction.

petrographic examination and, where applicable,
the chemical method of test, ASTM Designation
C 289, or by the results of previous tests or
service records of concrete made from similar
aggregates from the same source. The standards
for evaluating potential reactivity shall be as
described in ASTM Specification C-33, Appendix
A1. Aggregates indicated by any of the above to
be potentially reactive shall not be used, except
under one of the following conditions:
a. Applicable test results of mortar bar tests,
made according to ASTM Method C-227, are
available which indicate an expansion of less
than 0.10 per cent at six months in mortar bars
made with cement containing not less than 0.8
per cent alkalis expressed as sodium oxide; or
b. Concrete made from similar aggregates
from the same source has been demonstrated
to be sound after 3 years or more of service
under conditions of exposure to moisture and
weather similar to those anticipated for the
concrete under these specifications.

in welded steel wire fabric shall be as defined
in ACI Standard 315 of the American
Concrete Institute for the specified style
designations.
j. Steel reinforcement stored at the site of
the work shall be stored above the ground
surface on platforms, skids or other supports
and shall be protected from mechanical injury
and corrosion.
6. Admixtures:
Water-reducing and set-retarding admixtures shall
conform to the requirements of ASTM
Specification C-494, except that resistance to
freezing and thawing shall be determined in all
cases, and the minimum relative durability factor
shall be 95.

Type D, Water-Reducing and Retarding, as
defined in ASTM Specification C-494.
When added, in the manner and amount
recommended by the manufacturer, to the
concrete used on the job, with no change in the
cement content or proportions of the aggregates,
admixtures shall have the following effects:
a. Type A or Type D: The water content at
the required slump shall be at least 5 per cent
less with the admixture than without. The air
content shall remain within the range
specified, but shall not exceed 8 per-cent in
any case.
b. Type D: The time of initial setting,
determined as prescribed in ASTM C-494,
shall be from 1 to 3 hours longer with the
admixture than without.
7. Curing Compound:

ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
133
All curing compound shall be delivered to the site
of the work in the original container bearing the
name of the manufacturer and the brand name.
The compound shall be stored in a manner to
prevent damage to the containers and to protect
water-emulsion types from freezing.
13.03 CLASS OF CONCRETE:
For the purpose of practical identification, concrete
has been divided into four classes: Class AA(AE),
A(AE), B(AE) and C(AE). The specific use for each
Class is identified in the Chapter in which the
concrete is used. The symbol (AE) designates airentrainment.
Basic requirements for each class are as
follows:

13.04 COMPOSITION OF CONCRETE:
1. Aggregate:
Aggregates maximum size shall be not larger than
one-fifth (1/5) of the narrowest dimension
between forms within which the concrete is to be
cast, nor larger than three-fourths (3/4) of the
minimum clear spacing between reinforcing bars
or between reinforcing bars and forms. For unreinforced
concrete slabs, the maximum size of
aggregates shall not be larger than one-fourth
(1/4) the slab thickness.
2. Water:
Water shall be added to the mix to produce
concrete with the minimum practicable slump.
The slump of mechanically vibrated concrete
shall not exceed four-inch (4"). No concrete shall
be placed with a slump in excess of five-inch (5").
3. Air-Entrainment:
Air-Content for air-entrained concrete shall
comply with the following:
Course Aggregate
Size (in.)
Air Content
(percent)
1 1/2 to 2 1/2 5 + 1
3/4 or 1 6 + 1
3/8 or 1/2 7 + 1
The air-entraining agent shall be added as liquid
to the mixing water by means of mechanical
equipment capable of accurate measurement and
control.
4. Admixtures:
Water reducing, set retarding admixtures shall not
be used except with previous approval from the
Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer and shall in
such a case, conform to the standards of materials
set forth in the specification.
13.05 DESIGN OF THE CONCRETE MIX:
The proportions of the aggregates shall be such as to
produce a concrete mixture that will work readily
into the corners and angles of the forms and around
reinforcement when consolidated, but will not
segregate or exclude free water during consolidation.
Prior to placement of concrete, the
Developer/Contractor shall furnish the Public
Facilities Inspector/Engineer, for approval, a
statement of the materials and mix proportions
(including admixtures, if any) it intends to use. The
statement shall include evidence satisfactory to the
Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer that the materials
and proportions will produce concrete conforming to
this specification. The materials and proportions so
stated shall constitute the "job mix." After the job
mix has been reviewed for conformance to
specification by the Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer, neither the source, character,
grading of the aggregates, the type and brand of
cement, nor admixture shall be changed without prior
notice to the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer. If
such changes are necessary, no concrete containing
such new or altered materials shall be placed until the
Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer has approved a
revised job mix.
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
134
13.06 OBSERVATION AND TESTING:
The Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer shall have
free entry to the plant and equipment furnishing
concrete under the contract. Proper facilities shall be
provided for the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer
to observe the materials, equipment and processes
and to obtain samples of the concrete. All tests and
observations will be conducted so as not to interfere
unnecessarily with manufacture and delivery of the
concrete.
13.07 HANDLING AND MEASUREMENT OF
MATERIALS:
Materials shall be stockpiled and batched by methods
that will prevent segregation or contamination of
aggregates and insure accurate proportioning of the
ingredients of the mix.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, cement
and aggregates shall be measured as follows:
1. Cement shall be measured by weight or in
bags of 94 pounds each. When cement is
measured in bags, no fraction of a bag shall be
used unless weighed.
2. Aggregates shall be measured by weight.
Mix proportions shall be based on saturated,
surface-dry weights. The batch weight of each
aggregate shall be the required saturated, surfacedry
weight plus the weight of surface moisture it
contains.
3. Water shall be measured by weight, to
accuracy within one per cent of the total quantity
of water required for the batch.
4. Admixtures shall be measured within a limit
of accuracy of 3 per cent.
13.08 MIXERS AND MIXING:
Concrete shall be uniform and thoroughly mixed
when delivered to the work. Variations in slump of
more than 1 inch within a batch will be considered
evidence of inadequate mixing and shall be corrected
by increasing mixing time or other means. For
stationary mixers, the mixing time after all cement
and aggregates are in the mixer drum shall be not less
than 1 1/2 minutes. When concrete is mixed in a
truck mixer, the number of revolutions of the drum or
blades at mixing speed shall be not less than 70 or
more than 100.
Unless otherwise specified, volumetric batching and
continuous mixing at the construction site will be
permitted if approved by Public Facilities
Inspector/Engineer. The batching and mixing
equipment shall conform to the requirements of
ASTM Specification C-685 and shall be
demonstrated prior to placement of concrete, by tests
with the job mix, to produce concrete meeting the
specified proportioning and uniformity requirements.
Concrete made by this method shall be produced,
inspected, and certified in conformance with Sections
6, 7, 8, 13, and 14 of ASTM Specification C-685.
No mixing water in excess of the amount called for
by the job mix shall be added to the concrete during
mixing or hauling or after arrival at the delivery
point.
13.09 FORMS:
Forms shall be of wood, plywood, steel or other
approved material and shall be mortar tight. The
forms and associated falsework shall be substantial
and unyielding and shall be constructed so that the
finished concrete will conform to the specified
dimensions and contours. Form surfaces shall be
smooth and free from holes, dents, sags or other
irregularities. Forms shall be coated with nonstaining
form oil before being set into place.
Metal ties or anchors within the forms shall be
equipped with cones, she-bolts or other devices that
permit their removal to a depth of at least one inch
without injury to the concrete.
All edges that will be exposed to view when the
structure is completed shall be chamfered by placing
molding in the forms, unless finishing with molding
tools.
13.10 PREPARATION OF FORMS AND
SUBGRADE:
Prior to placement of concrete the forms and
subgrade shall be free of chips, sawdust, debris,
water, ice, snow, extraneous oil, mortar, or other
harmful substances or coatings. Any oil on the
reinforcing steel or other surfaces required to be
bonded to the concrete shall be removed. Rock
surfaces shall be cleaned by air-water cutting, wet
sandblasting or wire brush scrubbing, as necessary,
and shall be wetted immediately prior to placement
of concrete. Earth surfaces shall be firm and damp.
Placement of concrete on mud, dried earth or
uncompacted fill or frozen subgrade will not be
permitted.
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
135
Unless otherwise specified, when concrete is to be
placed over drain fill, the contact surface of the drain
fill shall be covered with a layer of asphaltimpregnated
building paper or polyvinyl sheeting
prior to placement of the concrete. Forms for
weepholes shall extend through this layer into the
drain fill.
Items to be embedded in the concrete shall be
positioned accurately and anchored firmly.
Weepholes in walls or slabs shall be formed with
nonferrous materials.
13.11 CONVEYING:
Concrete shall be delivered to the site and discharged
into the forms within 1 1/2 hours after the
introduction of the cement to the aggregates. In hot
weather or under conditions contributing to quick
stiffening of the concrete, the time between the
introduction of the cement to the aggregates and
discharge shall not exceed 45 minutes. The Public
Facilities Inspector/Engineer may allow a longer
time, provided the setting time of the concrete is
increased a corresponding amount by the addition of
an approved set-retarding admixture. In any case,
concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to the
forms as rapidly as practicable by methods that will
prevent segregation of the aggregates or loss of
mortar.
Concrete shall not be dropped more than five feet
vertically unless suitable equipment is used to
prevent segregation.
13.12 PLACING:
Concrete shall not be placed until the subgrade, forms
and steel reinforcement have been inspected and
approved. No concrete shall be placed except in the
presence of the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer.
The Developer/Contractor shall give 48-hour notice
to the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer each time
it intends to place concrete. Such notice will give the
Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer adequate time to
inspect the subgrade, forms, steel reinforcement and
other preparations for compliance with the
specifications before concrete is delivered for
placing.
The concrete shall be deposited as closely as possible
to its final position in the forms and shall be worked
into the corners and angles of the forms and around
all reinforcements and embedded items in a manner
to prevent segregation of aggregates or excessive
laitance. Unless otherwise specified, slab concrete
shall be placed to design thickness in one continuous
layer. Formed concrete shall be placed in horizontal
layers not more than 20 inches thick. Hoppers and
chutes, pipes or "elephant trunks" shall be used as
necessary to prevent splashing of mortar on the forms
and reinforcing steel above the layers being placed.
Immediately after the concrete is placed in the forms,
it shall be consolidated by spading, hand tramping or
vibration as necessary to insure smooth surfaces and
dense concrete. Each layer shall be consolidated to
insure monolithic bond with the preceding layer. If
the surface of a layer of concrete in place sets to the
degree that it will not flow and merge with the
succeeding layer when spaded or vibrated, the
Developer/Contractor shall discontinue placing
concrete and shall make a construction joint
according to the procedure specified.
If placing is discontinued when an incomplete
horizontal layer is in place, the unfinished end of the
layer shall be formed by a vertical bulkhead.
13.13 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS:
Construction joints shall be made at the locations
shown on the Drawings. If construction joints are
needed which are not shown on the Drawings, they
shall be placed in locations approved by the Public
Facilities Inspector/Engineer.
Where a featheredge would be produced at a
construction joint, as in the top surface of a sloping
wall, an inset form shall be used so that the resulting
edge thickness on either side of the joint is not less
than six-inches (6").
In walls and columns, as each lift is completed, the
top surfaces shall be immediately and carefully
protected from any condition that might adversely
affect the hardening of the concrete.
Steel tying and form construction adjacent to
concrete in place shall not be started until the
concrete has cured at least 12 hours. Before new
concrete is deposited on or against concrete that has
hardened, the forms shall be retightened. New
concrete shall not be placed until the hardening
concrete has cured at least 12 hours.
Surfaces of construction joints shall be cleaned of all
unsatisfactory concrete, laitance, coatings or debris
by washing and scrubbing with a wire brush or wire
broom or by other means approved by the Public
Facilities Inspector/Engineer. The surfaces shall be
ENGINEERING AND STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS TITLE 9
PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE
136
kept moist for at least one hour prior to placement of
the new concrete.
13.14 EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION
JOINTS:
Expansion and contraction joints shall be made only
at locations shown on the drawings.
Exposed concrete edges at expansion and contraction
joints shall be carefully tooled or chamfered, and the
joints shall be free of mortar and concrete. Joint filler
shall be left exposed for its full length with clean and
true edges.
Preformed expansion joint filler shall be held firmly
in the correct position as the concrete is placed.
Open joints, when specified, shall be constructed by
the insertion and subsequent removal of a wooden
strip, metal plate or other suitable template in such a
manner that the corners of the concrete will not be
chipped or broken. The edges of open joints shall be
finished with an edging tool prior to removal of the
joint strips.
13.15 WATERSTOP:
Waterstops shall be held firmly in the correct position
as the concrete is placed. Joints in metal waterstops
shall be soldered, brazed or welded. Joints in rubber
or plastic waterstops shall be cemented, welded or
vulcanized as recommended by the manufacturer.
13.16 REMOVAL OF FORMS:
Forms shall not be removed without the approval of
the Public Facilities Inspector/Engineer. Forms shall
be removed in such a way as to prevent damage to
the concrete. Supports shall be removed in a manner
that will permit the concrete to take the stresses due
to its own weight uniformly and gradually.
13.17 FINISHING FORMED SURFACES:
Immediately after the removal of the forms:
1. Projections:
All fins and irregular projections shall be
removed from exposed surfaces.
2. Imperfections:
On all surfaces, the holes produced by the
removal of form ties, cone-bolts, and she-bolts
shall be cleaned, wetted and filled with a dry-pack
mortar consisting of one part Portland cement,
three parts sand that will pass a No. 16 sieve, and
water just sufficient to produce a consistency such
that the filling is at the point of becoming rubbery
when the material is solidly packed.
13.18 FINISHING UNFORMED SURFACES:
All exposed surfaces on the concrete shall be
accurately screeded to grade and then float finished,
unless specified otherwise.
Excessive floating or troweling of surfaces while the
concrete is soft will not be permitted.
The addition of dry cement or water to the surface of
the screeded concrete to expedite finishing will not
be allowed.
Joints and edges on unformed surfaces that will be
exposed to view shall be chamfered or finished with

Barricades must be in place until all of the
Permittees equipment is removed from the site and
the excavation has been backfilled and proper
temporary gravel surface is in place, except where
backfilling and resurfacing is to be done by the City;
in which case the barricades, together with any
necessary lights, flares or torches, must remain in
place until the backfill work is actually commenced
by the City. From sunset to sunrise, all barricades
and excavations must be clearly outlined by adequate
signal lights, torches, etc. The Police Department
and Fire Department shall be notified at least 24
hours in advance of any planned excavation requiring

21.09 OTHER HIGHWAY PERMITS:
Holders of permits for work on highways owned or
under the jurisdiction of other government entities,
but located within the City limits, shall not be
required to obtain permits from the City under the
provisions of this Chapter, unless the work extends
beyond the back side of the curb, or beyond any other
designated jurisdictional boundary. Any City permit
shall not be construed to permit or allow work on a
County road on a State highway within the City
without an applicable County or State permit.
The Director, in his or her discretion, shall have the
right and authority to regulate work under permits
issued by other governmental entities with respect to
hours and days of work, and measures required to be

property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Chapter shall be construed to impose any duty,
implied or express, on the City or its employees,
officers, agents or assigns, relative to the protection
of traffic and safety of Persons or property, arising
out of the issuance of any permit issued by
government entities other than the City, or arising out
of any work performed on any Public Way owned or
within the jurisdiction of the City.
21.10 RELOCATION OF STRUCTURES IN
PUBLIC WAYS:

herein. Sewers, pipes, drains, tunnels, conduits, Pipe
Driveways, vaults, trash receptacles and overhead
and underground gas, electric, telephone,
telecommunication and communication facilities
shall specifically be subject to such directives. The
Person owning or maintaining the facilities or
structures shall, at their own cost and expense and
upon reasonable written notice by the City, promptly
protect, or promptly alter or relocate such facilities or
structures, or part thereof, as directed by the City. In
the event that such Person refuses or neglects to
conform to the directive of the City, the City shall

Inspector under this Section shall be under and
consistent with the Citys police power. Unless an
emergency condition exists, the Director/Public
Facilities Inspector shall make a good faith effort to
consult with the Person regarding any condition that
may result in a removal or relocation of facilities in
the Public Way to consider possible avoidance or
minimization of removal or relocation requirements
and provide the directive as far enough in advance of
the required removal or relocation to allow the
Person a reasonable opportunity to plan and minimize
cost associated with the required removal or
relocation.

STREET EXCAVATIONS/ROAD CUTS
215
This obligation does not apply to facilities or
structures originally located on private property
pursuant to a private easement, which property was
later incorporated into the Public Way, if that prior
private easement grants a superior vested right.
Any Person owning or maintaining facilities or
structures in the Public Way who fails to alter,
modify or relocate such facilities or structures upon
notice to do so by the Director/Public Facilities
Inspector shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor.
All costs of alteration, modification or relocation
shall be borne by the Person owning or maintaining
the facilities or structures involved.
The City may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or
other emergency, as determined by the City in its
reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the

excavation work, a temporary sidewalk or curb ramp
shall be constructed or provided. Said temporary
improvement shall be safe for travel and convenient
for users, and consistent with City standards for such.
Where excavations are made in paved areas, the
surface shall be replaced with a temporary gravel
surface until such time as the permanent repairs are
completed.
Protection of personal property of a private property
owner or city is the responsibility of the permitee.

residence or the real or Personal property of a
private Property Owner or the City, such
Permittee shall insure that such property is
returned, replaced and/or restored to a condition
that is comparable to the condition that existed
prior to the commencement of the work.
2. The costs associated with the disturbance and
the return, replacement and/or restoration shall be
borne by the Permittee. Further, a Permittee shall
reimburse a Property Owner or the City, for any
actual damage caused by the Permittee, its
subcontractor, or its independent contractor, in
connection with the disturbance of such property.
However, nothing in this Subsection shall require
the Permittee to pay a subscriber or private
Property Owner when that subscriber or private
Property Owner requests that the Permittee
remove, replace or relocate improvements
associated with the service provided by the
Permittee to the Property Owner and when the
Permittee exercises due care in the performance
of that service, or when the subscriber or private
Property Owner provided false information to the
Permittee on which the Permittee relied to its
detriment.
Examples of types of acts specifically included in this
Section are the following:

flow will not be interrupted. When it is necessary to
block or otherwise interrupt flow of the drainage
channel, a method of rerouting the flow must be
submitted for approval by the Director prior to the
blockage of the channel.
The requirements imposed upon the Permittee extend
to any subcontractor or independent contractor that
the Permittee might employee to perform the tasks
pursuant to the permit.

the right to require complete, certified copies of all
required insurance policies at any time.
Consequently, the Permittee shall be prepared to
provide such copies prior to the issuance of the
permit.
If any of the required policies are, or at any time
become, unsatisfactory to the City as to form or

same scope of coverage that would otherwise
be provided by a separate policy as required
by this Chapter; or

Chapter. The amount of the security required may be
increased or decreased at the discretion of the
Council whenever it appears that the amount and cost
of the work to be performed, and not satisfactorily
completed, may vary from the amount of security
otherwise required under this Chapter. The form of
the security and the entity issuing the security shall
be subject to the approval of the City Attorney.
Public utilities franchised by the City shall not be
required to file any security if such requirement is

shall proceed with diligence and expedition and
shall promptly complete such work and restore
the Public Way to Development Standards, so as
not to obstruct the public place or travel thereon

all excavations, restoration or pavement surfaces
shall be made immediately after backfilling is
completed or concrete is cured. If work is
expected to exceed the above duration, the
Permittee shall submit a detailed construction
schedule for approval. The schedule will address
means and methods to minimize traffic disruption
and complete the construction as soon as

under the permit. The issuance and acceptance of
any permit under this Chapter shall constitute such an
agreement by the Permittee to this Section.
This Chapter shall neither be construed as imposing
upon the City, its officers, employees and agents, any
liability or responsibility for damages to any Person
injured by or by reason of the performance of any
work within the Public Way, or under a permit issued

event of a disagreement, the Company shall make
payment under protest during the resolution of the

Neither payment of the franchise fee nor failure to
make such investigation shall be deemed to stop the
City or the Company in any way or prevent
subsequent investigation by either and collection or
return of any amount properly due. The aforesaid
thirty (30) day period is not intended and shall not act

City to use all poles and suitable overhead structures
owned by the Company within the City for City wires

police signal systems; provided, however, that the
Company shall assume no liability nor shall it have to
incur, directly or indirectly, any additional expense in
connection therewith, and the use of said poles and
structures by the City shall be in such a manner as not

operates and maintains its equipment. Such City
attachments shall be installed and maintained in
accordance with the reasonable requirements of

such rules and regulations, and the City may inspect
the manner of such work and require remedies as may
be necessary to assure compliance. It is understood
that this work involves the health, safety, and welfare
of the community and from time to time must be done
under circumstances which will make the prior
acquisition of a permit infeasible.
(6) The Company shall continue to use its best efforts

laws. Upon the City's request, the Company will

Company shall not, pursuant to this Franchise, place
any poles, mains, cables, structures, pipes, conduits or

conditions.

operation of law, unless the City shall first give its

recognition of the present state of uncertainty
respecting these matters, the Company and the City
each agree, on request of the other during the term of
this Franchise, to meet with the other and discuss in

the Courts in the event Public Service Commission
orders, rules or regulations make performance under
the Franchise illegal.

fulfill any of their respective obligations under this
Franchise, the City, or the Company, whichever the
case may be will have a breach of contract claim and

and all rights and privileges herein provided for any
of the following reasons:

Franchise and set forth therein the reasons therefore,
following not less than thirty (30) days prior written
notice to the Company of the public hearing on the
ordinance. The Company shall have an opportunity
at the public hearing to be heard upon the proposed
termination and, if terminated, the Council shall make
findings of fact and state its reasons for such action.
(3) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
preclude Company from pursuing any legal or
equitable rights or remedies it may have to challenge
the action of the City Council or any successor
governing body of the City following said ordinance's
adoption.

fee, the payment of which is required hereunder, shall

the direction of the City Manager, may institute a
civil action in the name of the City to recover any
unpaid fee. No civil judgment or any act by the City

19-7-8 Interfering with a Permitted Use
19-7-1 Intent. The use of Public Parks in the City
by groups causes wear and tear on the turf, Public
Park equipment, and facilities, and it requires staff
time to provide coordination. Additional supplies,
restroom cleaning and rubbish service are required.
These uses can subject neighboring residents to
excessive noise and traffic, particularly when the
Public Park is small or use is particularly intense.
Groups wishing to use a Public Park sometimes find
that their use is in conflict with that of another group,
and on occasion, group use is so intense that casual
use by families and individuals, which is one of the
principal purposes of Public Park, is not possible.
Because Public Parks are attractive and well
maintained, their use is intensifying, particularly for
activities like employee picnics, family gatherings,
church groups and by groups from other cities. These
groups do not contribute to the maintenance of Public
Park through the payment of property taxes and
assessments. If the City does not regulate the
intensity of group use of its Public Parks, and provide
for the payment of fees where appropriate, it will not
be able to maintain the very qualities in its Public
Parks that make them attractive.
19-7-2 Permit Required.
(1) No group desiring to have exclusive use of a
reservable bowery within a Public Park, for a specific
period of time, shall do so without first obtaining a
permit from the Recreation Director.
(2) No group desiring to utilize the Community
Center or other building within Public Park shall do
so without first obtaining a permit from the
Recreation Director.
(3) Permits are intended to secure the area
specifically stated on the permit for the permitee and
do not imply exclusive use of any other area or the
entire area of a Public Park unless specifically
outlined in the permit.
19-7-3 Permit - Cost - Deposit. All fees and
deposits are to be paid to the Recreation Department
upon a permit being issued. No permit is valid unless
the cost and deposit required by §19-6-9 have been
paid to the Recreation Department.
19-7-4 Permit - Application - Contents.
Applications for permits shall be made in writing on
forms provided by the Recreation Director, or other
means developed by the Recreation Director, and
shall be filed with the Recreation Department
together with any application fees as may be
established as set in §19-6-9. The application shall
accurately identify the applicant, the nature of the
event, the preferred date, time and location, the
expected attendance, the activities proposed, if power
is requested and any furniture, equipment, banners, or
sound amplification proposed, together with other
information as the Recreation Director shall
determine is necessary to determine if the application
should be issued under the standards of this chapter.
19-7-5 Permit - Review and Issuance.
(1) The Recreation Director shall propose and City
Council shall review and adopt by resolution time
limits within which applications must be filed or
reservations made, establishing and designating those
portions of Public Parks for which reservations and
permits shall be allowed or required for group events.
Consideration shall be given to setting insurance
requirements, setting priorities among categories of
City-based and nonresident group events, length of
time for which an area may be reserved, and
otherwise establishing the procedures and standards
for group events by the Recreation Director. No
Public Park may be entirely reserved for group
events.
(2) The Recreation Department shall provide notice
to owners of property within three hundred feet of
any Public Park when the recreation department
approves any Public Park use by any group of three
hundred or more or by any group which wishes to use
amplified sound. City sponsored functions are
exempt from notice requirements.
(3) The Recreation Director, in consultation with the
Superintendent, shall issue a group event permit upon
determining that the proposed group event can be
accommodated at the time and date requested, and at
a location in which it can take place without
damaging the Public Park landscaping and
equipment, overloading any restroom and other
facilities, conflicting with other events, or creating
traffic congestion or excessive noise in the
neighborhood. In allocating sites for group events,
the Recreation Director shall consider both the
impact of the particular group event and the
cumulative impact of events in that location. The
permit shall be issued with conditions as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter, and
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 19 Public Parks and Trails
may include a requirement that City staff be present
during the event. Fees for staff required at an event
shall be established as set in §19-6-9. Equipment and
activities that may damage the Public Park or
adversely impact the neighborhood may be
prohibited. While applicants may designate a
preferred location, the decision as to which site may
be used shall be made by the Recreation Director.
(4) A permit shall be denied if the findings of § (3)
above cannot be made to create an acceptable impact
upon the Public Park, and it may be denied if, within
the past two years, the applicant or the group has
failed to abide by the terms of a previously issued
permit, or has otherwise violated the provisions of
this title.
19-7-6 Appeal. The Recreation Director's decision
may be appealed to the City Manager by filing an
appeal, in writing, within ten (10) days of receiving
the Recreation Directors decision.
19-7-7 Signs  Permitted Site.
(1) This chapter shall apply in all Public Parks even if
signs are not posted advising of the requirement of
permits for group events.
(2) If a permit has been issued a minimum of seven
(7) days prior to an event, the Recreation Director
shall cause a notice to be placed at the location,
within the Public Park, indicating when the site is
reserved.
19-7-8 Interfering with a Permitted Use.
(1) No unauthorized person shall occupy a reserved
site thirty (30) minutes prior to or after a permitted
event without the explicit permission of the permitted
event organizers.
No unauthorized person shall interfere with an event
or the participants of an event in the area for which a
permit has been issued without explicit permission of
the permitted event organizers.

stormwater to infiltrate into the ground surface.
Treatment Control BMP means a BMP that is
intended to remove pollutants from stormwater.

shall be installed unless the Public Works Director
authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap
or other alternative pretreatment technology and
determines that the installation of a grease
interceptor would not be feasible due to space
constraints or other considerations. The food
service establishment bears the burden of
demonstrating that the installation of a grease
interceptor is not feasible.
(2) If an establishment believes the installation of a
grease interceptor is infeasible, because of
documented space constraints, the request for an
alternate grease removal device shall contain the
following information:
(a) Location of sewer main and easement in relation
to available exterior space outside building.
(b) Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses
common plumbing for all services at that site.
(c) Alternative pretreatment technology includes,
but is not limited to, devices that are used to trap,
separate and hold grease from wastewater and
prevent it from being discharged into the sewerage
collection system. All alternative pretreatment
technology must be appropriately sized and
approved by the Public Works Director.
23-9-3 Wastewater Discharge Limitations. No
User shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from a grease interceptor, grease trap
or alternative pretreatment technology to exceed
100 MgPL (milligrams per liter), as identified by
EPA test method 1664 revision A and its
amendments as may be amended from time to time.

23-11-4 Waivers for Providing Stormwater
Management. Every applicant shall provide for
stormwater management as required by this Title,
unless the State of Utah gives a waiver through the
UPDES program.
23-11-5 Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP).
(1) A SWPPP shall be required with all Land Use
Permit applications and will include sufficient
information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations,
etc) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of
the project site, the potential impacts of all
proposed development on the site, both present and
future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness
and acceptability of the measures proposed for
managing stormwater generated at the project site.
(2) The intent of this conceptual planning process is
to determine the type of stormwater management
measures necessary for the proposed project, and to
ensure adequate planning for management of
stormwater runoff from future development. The
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan shall be
prepared in accordance with the guidelines set forth
by the EPA, the Utah Division of Environmental
Quality, and Clinton Citys Ordinances.
(3) For development or redevelopment occurring on
a previously developed site, an applicant shall be
required to include within the stormwater concept
plan measures for controlling existing stormwater
runoff discharges from the site in accordance with
the standards of this Title to the maximum extent
practicable.
23-11-6 As Built Plans. All applicants are
required to submit actual "as built" plans for any
stormwater management practices located on-site
after final construction is completed. The plan must
show the final design specifications for all
stormwater management facilities and must be
certified by a professional engineer. A final
inspection by the Public Works Department is
required before the release of any performance
securities can occur.
23-11-7 Post Construction. Unless judged by the
City to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed
for stormwater management at all sites:
(1) All site designs shall establish stormwater
management practices to control the peak flow rates
of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of
stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize
pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to
infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped
areas to the maximum extent practical to provide
treatment for both water quality and quantity.
(2) All stormwater runoff generated from new
development shall not discharge untreated
stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or
local water body without adequate treatment.
Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of
the proposal on wetland functional values shall be
assessed using a method acceptable to the City. In
no case shall the impact on functional values be any
less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers
(ACE) or the Department of Environmental Quality
(DEQ) responsible for natural resources.
(3) Prior to design, applicants are required to
consult with the City to determine if they are
subject to additional stormwater design
requirements.
23-11-8 Basic Stormwater Management Design
Criteria.
(1) Stormwater management practices for a site
shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of
the site. Among the factors that should be
considered:
(a) Topography
(b) Maximum Drainage Area
(c) Depth to Water Table
(d) Soils
(e) Slopes
(f) Terrain
(g) Flow Rate
(h) Location in relation to environmentally sensitive
features or ultra-urban areas.
(i) Vegetation, both predevelopment and postdevelopment.
23-11-9 Conveyance Issues. All stormwater
management practices shall be designed to convey
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 23 Sewerage, Stormwater, and
Flood Irrigation Systems
stormwater to allow for the removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include,
but not be limited to:
(1) Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to
outflow points;
(2) Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
(3) Elimination of erosive flow velocities;
(4) Providing of underdrain systems, where
applicable.
23-11-10 Footing and Foundation Subdrains 
Land Drain. Throughout the City there are high
water tables where the depth from the surface varies
depending upon many factors, significantly the soil
and annual weather conditions.
(1) It is the responsibility of the builder, property
owner, and/or resident:
(a) To protect their property form the hazards of
high ground water;
(b) To control and properly disperse/direct all
surface and ground water on private property;
(c) To insure that all surface water is directed into
established public utility and drainage easements.
(2) Surface drains, landscape drains, rain gutters,
and other drains containing solid or liquid materials,
other than ground water, shall not be connected to
the Land Drain without specific written permission
of the City.
(3) Footing and foundation subdrains shall be
installed as established in the International
Residential Code and the City typical footing and
foundation subdrain detail available at the
Community Development Department.
(4) It is each land owners responsibility to insure
that public utility and drainage easements are
maintained for proper flow and not blocked by
changes in grade, landscape features, concrete pads,
accessory buildings or other factor.
23-11-11 Landscaping Plans Required.
(1) All Land Use Permits will be evaluated to
determine if the storm water management plans
have a final stabilization plan.
(2) All owners with property within the City are
required to control run-off from roofs, downspouts,
concrete slabs, and other impervious surfaces or
excess water from landscape maintenance from
flowing onto neighboring properties.
23-11-12 Maintenance Agreements.
(1) All stormwater systems and management
practices shall have an enforceable operation and
maintenance agreement to ensure the system
functions as designed.
(2) The agreement will include any and all
maintenance easements required to access and
inspect the system, best management practices for
the system, and required maintenance, as necessary,
to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater
systems.
(3) The agreement shall include provisions allowing
for access and inspections on a reasonable basis, by
the City.
(4) The agreement shall establish a legally binding
covenant specifying the parties responsible for the
proper maintenance of all stormwater systems.
(5) This agreement shall be shall be secured prior to
issuance of any Land Use Permits.
23-11-13 Stormwater Utility Fee Imposed. Each
developed parcel of real property in the City shall
be charged a stormwater utility fee.
(1) ESU - The fee shall be based on the number of
equivalent service units (ESUs) contained in the
parcel. The City Council finds that the ESU is the
most equitable and practical measurement for
determining the amount that each parcel contributes
to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the stormwater
utility. The Clinton City Council, based upon a
study completed by an independent engineer may
by resolution amend the impervious surface area
that equals one ESU.
(2) Calculation  The City Council finds that each
single-family residential parcel contributes
approximately the same amount of stormwater
runoff; therefore, each developed single-family
residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one (1)
ESU. All non-single family residential parcels shall
pay a multiple of this base rate, expressed in ESUs,
according to the measured impervious area on the
parcel. The City Council may adopt separate rates
for planned residential developments,
condominiums and other uses that are not easily
handled under the standard rate schedule.
(3) Charge per ESU  The amount charged for each
ESU shall be established from time to time by
resolution of the City Council and published in the
Consolidated Fee Schedule.
(4) Exemptions and Credits  The City Council
may establish exemptions and credits to the
stormwater utility fee by resolution.
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 23 Sewerage, Stormwater, and
Flood Irrigation Systems
23-11-14 Storm Water Detention. All
development with the exception of residential
homes are required to provide onsite detention and
are to conform to the guidelines used in the Citys
storm drain master plan.
(1) The allowed release rate from the onsite
detention basins is 0.2 cfs/acre. The area is to be
determined from the plat and/or site plan. Flows in
excess of the allowed release rate are to be
detained.
(2) The storm that is to be used for detention pond
design shall be as defined in the Storm Drain
Master Plan.
(3) All detention ponds are to be designed with an
emergency overflow that will direct water back into
the streets or adjacent waterway and will not cause
flooding to adjacent property owners.
(4) Due to the existing high groundwater table and
soil conditions that are not conducive to infiltrating
water into the ground, retention basins are not
allowed with out written approval from the Public
Works Director. A geotechnical analysis with
percolation tests will be required for consideration
of a retention basin.
(5) Underground detention will be allowed if the
storage system is completely enclosed and can be
shown that water will not infiltrate from the
detention system into the ground. The underground
system must be solid pipes. No membranes,
fabrics, half pipe systems, perforated pipe systems,
etc. will be allowed. These non-solid pipe systems
fall under the provisions for a retention basin.
Recommendations and guidelines for maintenance
and cleaning of the underground detention system
must also be included in the design and
incorporated into the maintenance agreement.
(6) All detention ponds shall be landscaped and the
landscaping is to be approved by the Planning
Commission. Landscaping must be done in a
manner to prevent erosion.
(7) The bottom of the detention ponds are to be dry
when not in use. This requires that nuisance water
from sprinkler, groundwater, etc. be carried through
the pond by the means of concrete channels, low
flow pipes, etc.

23-12-11 Standards for Subdivision Proposals
23-12-1 Findings of Fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of Utah are subject to
periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2) These flood loses are created by the cumulative
effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an
increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands
because they are inadequately elevated, flood
proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
23-12-2 Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
(1) In order to accomplish its purposes, this Title
uses the following methods to reduce flood losses:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to
health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause
excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities, which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains,
stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other
development, which may increase flood damage;
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
23-12-3 Lands to which this Chapter Applies.
This Chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood
hazard within the jurisdiction of Clinton City.
23-12-4 Basis for Establishing the Areas of
Special Flood Hazard. Since areas of special
flood hazard have not been identified, water surface
elevations have not been provided, nor has
sufficient data identifying the floodway or coastal
high hazard area been provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the
community shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize data available from other Federal, State or
other sources.
23-12-5 Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of
protection required by this Title is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. On rare
occasions greater floods can and will occur and
flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This Title does not imply that land
outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This Title shall not
create liability on the part of the City or any official
or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this Title or any
administrative decision lawfully made there under.
23-12-6 Designation of the Floodplain
Administrator. The Community Development
Director, or his designated representative, is hereby
appointed the Floodplain Administrator to
administer and implement the provisions of this
Title and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR
(National Flood Insurance Program Regulations)
pertaining to floodplain management.
23-12-7 Duties and Responsibilities of the
Floodplain Administrator. Duties and
responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Maintain and hold open for public inspection all
records pertaining to the provisions of this Title.
(2) Reviews permit application to determine
whether proposed construction or other
development, including the placement of
manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
(3) Review, approve or deny all applications for
Land Use Permits required by adoption of this Title.
(4) Review permits for proposed development to
assure that all necessary permits have been obtained
from those Federal, State or local governmental
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 23 Sewerage, Stormwater, and
Flood Irrigation Systems
agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,
33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is
required.
(5) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to
be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions) the Floodplain
Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation.
23-12-8 Permit Procedures. Application for a
Land Use Permit shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by
him and may include, but not be limited to, plans
(multiple copies) drawn to scale showing the
location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed
landscape alterations, existing and proposed
structures, including the placement of structures,
and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas
of special flood hazard.
(1) Additionally, the following information is
required:
(a) Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the
lowest floor (including basement) of all new and
substantially improved structures;
(b) Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which
any nonresidential structure shall be flood proofed;
(c) A certificate from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the nonresidential flood
proofed structure shall meet the flood proofing
criteria;
(d) Description of the extent to which any
watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development; and,
(e) Maintain a record of all such information.
(2) Approval or denial of a Land Use Permit by the
Floodplain Administrator shall be based on all of
the provisions of this Title and the following
relevant factors:
(a) The danger to life and property due to flooding
or erosion damage;
(b) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and
its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
(c) The danger that materials may be swept onto
other lands to the injury of others;
(d) The compatibility of the proposed use with
existing and anticipated development;
(e) The safety of access to the property in times of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(f) The costs of providing governmental services
during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and

23-12-9 Variance Procedures.
(1) The Clinton City Planning Commission will act
as the Appeal Board and shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this Title.
(2) The Appeal Board shall hear and render
judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there
is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement or administration
of this Title.
(3) Any person or persons aggrieved by the
decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such
decision to District Court. All appeals actions are
to be heard in Farmington Second District Court.
(4) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a
record of all actions involving an appeal and shall
report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
(5) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on

Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the
procedures set forth in the remainder of this Title.
(6) Variances may be issued for new construction
and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing
the relevant factors have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 23 Sewerage, Stormwater, and
Flood Irrigation Systems
(7) Upon consideration of the factors noted above
and the intent of this Title, the Appeal Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this Title.
(8) Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(9) Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
(10) Prerequisites for granting variances:
(a) Variances shall only be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(i) Showing a good and sufficient cause;
(ii) A determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and,
(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(c) Any application to which a variance is granted
shall be given written notice that the structure will
be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation.
(d) Variances may be issued by the City for new
construction and substantial improvements and for
other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
(i) The criteria outlined this Title are met; and,
(ii) The structure or other development is protected
by methods that minimize flood damages during the
base flood and create no additional threats to public
safety.

Chapter 1. Purpose and Scope
24-1-1 Purpose
24-1-2 Scope
24-1-3 Interpretation
24-1-1 Purpose. The purpose of this title shall be
to coordinate the type, placement, and physical
dimensions of signs within the different land use
zones; to recognize the commercial communication
requirements of all sectors of the business
community; to encourage the innovative use of
design; to promote both renovation and proper
maintenance; to allow for special circumstances;
and to guarantee equal treatment under the law
through accurate record keeping and consistent
enforcement.
(a) These shall be accomplished by regulation of
the display, erection, use, and maintenance of signs.
The use of signs is regulated according to zone. The
placement and physical dimensions of signs are
regulated primarily by type and length of street
frontage. No sign shall be permitted as a main or
accessory use except in accordance with the
provisions of this title.
(b) It is also the intention and purpose of this
chapter to promote short and long term civic beauty
and order by establishing standards and regulations
for sign design, location, size, type, compatibility,
and aesthetics. By doing so it is hoped this
ordinance will help to create streetscapes that are
functional and attractive to both residents of
Clinton City as well as visitors.
24-1-2 Scope.
(a) This title shall not relate to building design. Nor
shall the title regulate official traffic or government
signs; the copy and message of signs; product
dispensers; scoreboards on athletic fields; flags of
any nation, government, noncommercial
organization; gravestones; barber poles;
commemorative plaques; the display of street
numbers; or any display or construction not defined
herein as a sign.
(b) It is not the intent of this ordinance to regulate
the content of public speech. The regulations of
this chapter are intended to apply to both onpremise
and off-premise signs, but do not apply to
hand-held placards and other similar devices
traditionally used for public protest and the exercise
of free speech. Any non-commercial message may
be substituted for any commercial message
permitted under this ordinance.
24-1-3 Interpretation. In interpreting and
applying the provisions of this chapter, the sign
regulations contained herein are declared to be the
maximum allowable for the purposes set forth. If
the Community Development Director determines
that an application needs further interpretation, he
may request Planning Commission review of the
proposal. If the applicant wishes to propose or
retain a sign that exceeds ordinance standards, he
may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a
variance or special exception.

24-4-2 Signs that Require a Permit.
(1) Purpose: The streetscape is the combination of
vehicles, buildings, signs, landscaping, roads, utility
poles, etc., that dominant the view of the driver or
pedestrian. The streetscape tells residents and visitors
how the City as a whole feels about the environment,
safety, aesthetics, and its sense of order, among other
things. A useful, attractive, and safe streetscape is
one that necessarily regulates the size, location, and
design of business signs. Because a proliferation of
poorly designed, oversized, and inappropriately
located signs in commercial and industrial areas can
be detrimental to the achievement of effective, safe
and attractive streetscapes, it is important that the
permanent signs in these areas receive approval
(permits) from the City.
(2) Commercial and industrial uses are generally
more intensive than those found in residential zones.
Since these uses are designed by size, location, and
style to attract attention and provide services to the
public, they generally need signage to achieve that
end. Business signs of any kind in residential
neighborhoods can diminish the quality of life for
which those zones were specifically created.
However, there may be some residential uses which
merit a sign, though much smaller and subdued than
in commercial or industrial zones. Therefore, it is the
intent and purpose of this section to outline
regulations and design standards for signs in both
commercial/industrial and residential areas that will
allow the business to identify itself while allowing
Clinton City to create and maintain safe and
aesthetically pleasing streetscapes regardless of zone.
(3) Sign Theme Required: All multi-tenant
centers/buildings must submit a proposal for all onpremise
signs to the Planning Commission, as part of
the site plan review process, for design and
placement approval. In cases for parcels of land of
seven (7) acres or larger, and with frontage of three
hundred (300) feet or more, a proposal for the overall
design and placement of all on-premise signs shall be
submitted. The signs may vary from the regulations
set forth herein and shall be considered as part of the
site plan approval process; providing there are
findings established by the Planning Commission
stating that the proposed sign exceptions are not in
conflict with the purpose and intent of this Chapter
and are in architectural harmony with uses adjacent
to the development and with the understanding
existing signage may be required to be altered or
removed.
(4) On-Premise Freestanding Signs. The size and
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 24 Signs and Advertising Devices
height of freestanding signs are allowed as
follows:
(a) Planned centers or parcels less than ten (10)
acres. No freestanding signs allowed except as
allowed in 24-4-2(3) above. Only monument
signs are allowed.
(b) Ten (10) acres or more. The Planning
Commission, as part of the site plan approval
process, may approve one freestanding sign per
street frontage. No freestanding sign shall be
allowed for any planned center or parcel that has
less than three hundred (300) feet of street
frontage. Sign height may not exceed twenty-two
(22) feet. Signs must be at least two hundred
(200) feet from the corner.
(c) Electronic message centers are allowed,

lineal feet of street frontage over fifty (50) feet,
maximum size is sixty (60) square feet. Parcels
with two street frontages are allowed a sign on
each street. However, the signs must be separated
by at least one hundred (100) feet as measured
diagonally across the property from center to
center of both signs or only one (l) sign will be
allowed. Signs within the visibility triangle may
be allowed with the permission of the Clinton
City Engineer.
(ii) Monument signs must have at least a one (1)
foot pedestal, and the height of the sign may not
exceed five (5) feet for a total of six (6) feet. The
height to the top of the sign may vary where the
sign is placed upon a landscape berm. The
combined height of the sign plus landscaped berm
may not exceed nine (9) feet as measured from
the top of the curb. The frontage of the property
must be bermed a minimum lineal distance equal
to one-half of the square footage of the sign for
this to occur. The area around sign base and any
berm shall be landscaped.
(iii) Electronic Message Centers (EMC) may be
allowed, however, the devices shall not exceed
50% of the gross total sign area calculated in § (i)
above and height limitations established in § (ii)
above.
(b) EMC Standards

face the residential zone.
(ii) The brightness of an EMC shall be measured with
an illuminance meter set to measure footcandles
accurate to at least two decimals and tested within the
last 36 months. An ambient light measurement shall
be taken using a foot candle meter at some point
between the period of time between 30 minutes past
sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise with the EMC
to a blackscreen, and any other lighting associated
with the sign, turned off.
(iii) Immediately following the ambient light
measurement taken in the manner required in § (ii)
above an operating sign light measurement shall be
taken with the sign, and all associated sign lighting
turned on to full white copy.
(iv) All measurements shall be taken perpendicular to
the face of the EMC at the distance determined by the
total square footage of the EMC as set forth in Table
24-4-2(5).
(v) The difference between the ambient light
measurement and solid-message measurements using
the EMC Measurement Criteria shall not exceed
three-tenths 0.3 footcandles.
(vi) EMCs shall display static images for not less
than two seconds before transitioning to another
static image. Transitions may utilize frame effects
but flashing signs are prohibited.

limited to on-site advertising only. However, this
does not apply to municipal signage providing
information to the public related to civic events.
(ix) All permitted EMCs shall be equipped with a
sensor or other device that automatically
determines the ambient illumination and
programmed to automatically dim according to
ambient light conditions, or that can be adjusted

sign. In no case shall the approved monument
sign be placed closer than one hundred (100) feet
to any other sign (monument or
freestanding/pole) located on the same side of
street.
(iii) The area of the sign is determined by the
length of the frontage along which the sign is to
be placed, including the frontage of any
freestanding buildings included within the
planned commercial center. The sign area is
determined as provided in sub-paragraph 5.a
above.
(iv) In the case of the development of a planned
commercial center on multiple parcels of property
having common frontages, regardless of the
number of separately owned parcels or buildings
of separate occupancy within the planned
commercial center, the frontage shall be
considered to be the composite of the entire
commonly-used parcels or buildings and not the
frontage of each individual business or occupancy.
The over-all frontage shall be used to calculate
allowable sign area for the center identification sign
as provided in sub-paragraph one (1) above.

(6) Wall Signs. Wall signs should be the primary
form of identification for business uses in the
City. Each business is entitled to one wall sign if
the following criteria are met:
(a) The sign may not occupy more than 10% or
six hundred (600) square feet, which ever is less,
of the flat wall area. If a sloping facade or roof
exists, the sign may not exceed 10% or six
hundred (600) square feet, which ever is less, of
that area. A wall sign may not use a combination
of both flat and sloping areas in calculating the
10%. On a sloping roof the vertical projection is
used to calculate area not actual length of the
slope.
(b) The 10% area of the primary wall and the 5%
area of all secondary walls may be divided into
more than one sign under the following
requirements and restrictions:
Requirements:
(i) The sign package blends with the aesthetics of
the building and surrounding natural and
manmade environment.
(ii) The sign package color, style, size, scale and
proportion enhances the exterior of the building
and does not place too much bulk and external
distractions on the exterior of the building.

scale of the building.
Restrictions:
(i) The maximum number of wall signs on any
given wall, including multi-tenant buildings, shall

sign will be considered a complete phrase and the
suggested layout of the sign package (i.e., the
individual words may either be lumped together
as one phrase to equal 1 sign, or spread out to be
many different signs, the as 1 Hour Photo
would be considered one sign.)
(ii) The maximum number of multiple wall signs
on any given wall shall be limited to seven (7).
The maximum square footage shall be limited be
six hundred (600) square feet or 10% of the wall
(5% if a secondary wall), whichever is less.
(iii) Multi-tenant buildings may receive a
conditional use permit so that the building may
exceed the maximum number of signs to
accommodate the additional sign if the Planning
Commission judges the additional sign to be
consistent with the criteria set forth above.

part shall project more than eighteen (18) inches from
the face of the building to which it is attached.
(i) Upon review and approval by the Planning
Commission, a business may request the placement
of a business identification sign upon a wall not
otherwise located above the named business. When
reviewing the requests, the Planning Commission
shall consider the following criteria:
(i) The proposed sign is in close proximity to the
identified business.
(ii) The proposed sign square footage is counted
against the allowable square footage for the wall
upon which it is mounted (i.e., if a business who
occupies the space permits another business to share
the wall for signage, the additional sign will be
included when calculating the permitted amount of
square footage for the primary business).

(1) Regulation, Containment, and Elimination. In
order to minimize confusion and unfair
competitive disadvantage to businesses which are
required to satisfy the current sign ordinance
standards, the City intends to apply firm
regulation of existing nonconforming signs with a
view to their eventual elimination. This goal shall
be achieved by strictly construing limits on
change, expansion, alteration, or restoration of
abandoned signs.
(2) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after
vacation of a business, any on-site nonconforming
signs must be removed or brought into
compliance by the property owner. If removal
does not occur, Clinton City may have the entire
nonconforming sign (both face and structure)
removed through the processes specified in § 24-
9-2 below. An abandoned sign may not regain
any legal nonconforming status later, even if the
original business reoccupies the property.
(3) Existing signs which do not conform to the
specific provisions of this title may be eligible for
the designation "legal nonconforming" provided
that:
(a) The original business remains at that location;
and
(b) The Director determines that the signs were
constructed in accordance with the existing
ordinance at the time and have been properly
maintained and do not in any way endanger the
public.

raised, moved, placed, extended or enlarged unless
the sign is changed so as to conform to all provisions
of this title. On premise non-conforming signs which
are destroyed by natural causes i.e., earthquakes,
floods, winds etc., exceeding 60% of the signs true
value must be brought into conformance. Nonconforming
signs shall be allowed to have routine
maintenance including the repair or replacement of
the sign face by an existing business but shall not be
allowed to increase the height, size or the location
thereof. If a business applies for an increase of
square footage other than for temporary signs all
signs on the site shall be brought into conformance
with the provisions of this title.
(5) The following alterations are on existing
nonconforming signs are permittable:
(a) Face changes in nonconforming multi-tenant
signs: and,
(b) Face changes on nonconforming signs by an
existing business; and,
(c) Copy changes in nonconforming permanent signs
which were originally approved by the City with a
changeable copy feature.
(6) Appeal. Any person who has been ordered to
remove an abandoned sign or who has grievance with

Crosswalk
(1) That part of a roadway at an intersection included
within the connections of the lateral lines of the
sidewalks on opposite sides of the street measured
from the curbs, or in the absence of curbs, from the
edges of the traversable roadway; and in the absence
of a sidewalk on one side of the roadway, the part of
a roadway included within the extension of the lateral
lines of the existing sidewalk at right angles to the
centerline.
(2) Any portion of a roadway at an intersection or
elsewhere distinctly indicated for pedestrian crossing
by lines or other markings on the surface. (1992
Uniform Vehicle Code Section 1-112)
Uncontrolled Crosswalks Unmarked crosswalk at
an intersection.
25-19-2 Intersection Crosswalks. Crosswalks exist
at all public street intersections whether they are
marked or unmarked. Crosswalks will typically be
marked at signalized intersections, school crossing
locations, and areas of considerable pedestrian
activity.
25-19-3 Uncontrolled Crosswalks. Before
installing a new marked crosswalk at uncontrolled
street crossings, a staff evaluation is required to
determine if the location is suitable for a marked
crosswalk. The evaluation will be a Council
approved rating system, Guidelines and Standards
for Pedestrian Crossings based on guidelines
established by Federal Highways Administration
(FHA) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic control
Devices (MUTCD) guidelines. It is recommended
that a minimum of 20 pedestrian crossings per peak
hour (or 15 or more elderly and/or child pedestrians)
be confirmed at a location before being considered
for installation of marked crosswalk.
25-19-4 Crosswalk Installation. The need for

as part of the staff evaluation. Where it is determined
to install a crosswalk, the crosswalk shall be
constructed per the MUTCD guidelines.

of the staff review will be evaluated and the results
presented to the Manager with a recommendation to
either install or not install the crosswalk.
Recommendation will include the cost of necessary
right-of-way and safety enhancements. If the
crosswalk is to be installed, based upon the
recommendation, the Manager will establish a
priority within the constraints of the budget.
25-19-6 Appeal of a Decision not to Install a
Crosswalk. If the decision of staff is that the
crosswalk should not be installed, an appeal by
interested parties may be made to the City Council.
The decision of the Council will be final.

28-2-1 Policy Considerations. There is an
underlying policy in the city strongly favoring the
careful consideration of matters involving
Constitutional Taking claims, in fairness to the owner
of private property bringing the claim and in view of
the uncertainty and expense involved in defending
lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same time, the
legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating
real property must be preserved and the public's right
to require the dedication or exaction of property
consistent with the Constitution. Consistent with this
policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for
the review of actions that may involve the issue of a
Constitutional Taking. These provisions are to assist
governments in considering decisions that may
involve Constitutional Takings. It is intended that a
procedure for such a review be provided, as well as
guidelines for such considerations. This ordinance is
further intended and shall be construed to objectively
and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific
government action should require payment of just
compensation, yet preserve the ability of the city to
lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other
duties and functions.
History: 9/95
28-2-2 Definitions.

(b) Article I, Section 22, of the Utah Constitution;
(c) Any court ruling governing the physical taking or

The City of Clinton finds that the Rights- of-way
within the City:
(1) Are critical to the travel and transport of
persons and property in the business and social
life of the City;
(2) Are intended for public uses and must be
managed and controlled consistent with that
intent;
(3) Can be partially occupied by the facilities of
utilities and other public service entities
delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare,
and general economic well-being of the City and
its citizens; and
(4) Are a unique and physically limited resource
requiring proper management to maximize the
efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize
the inconvenience to and negative effects upon
the public from such facilities' construction,
placement, relocation, and maintenance in the
Rights-of-Way.
29-1-2 Finding Regarding Compensation.
The City finds that the City should receive fair
and reasonable compensation for use of the
Rights-of-Way.
29-1-3 Finding Regarding Local Concern.
The City finds that while Telecommunications
Systems are in part an extension of interstate
commerce, their operations also involve Rightsof-
Way, municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of
local concern.
29-1-4 Finding Regarding Promotion of
Telecommunications Services. The City finds
that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and
citizens to promote the rapid development of
Telecommunications Services, on a
nondiscrimination basis, responsive to
community and public interest, and to assure
availability for municipal, educational and
community services.
29-1-5 Findings Regarding Franchise
Standards. The City finds that it is in the interest
of the public to franchise and to establish
standards for franchising Providers in a manner
that:

on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory
basis as provided herein;
(2) Encourages competition by establishing terms
and conditions under which Providers may use
the Rights-of-Way to serve the public;
(3) Fully protects the public interests and the
City from any harm that may flow from such
commercial use of Rights-of-Way;
(4) Protects the police powers and Rights-of-
Way management authority of the City, in a
manner consistent with federal and state law;
(5) Otherwise protects the public interests in the
development and use of the City infrastructure;
(6) Protects the public's investment in
improvements in the Rights-of-Way; and
(7) Ensures that no barriers to entry of
Telecommunications Providers are created and
that such franchising is accomplished in a
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 29 Telecommunications Rights-Of-Way
manner that does not prohibit or have the effect
of prohibiting Telecommunication Services,
within the meaning of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 (Act).
29-1-6 Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The
City adopts this Telecommunications Ordinance
pursuant to its power to manage the Rights-of-
Way, pursuant to common law, the Utah
Constitution and statutory authority, and receive
fair and reasonable, compensation for the use of
Rights-of-Way by Providers as expressly set
forth by Section 253 of the Act.
29-1-7 Scope of Ordinance. This Ordinance
shall provide the basic local scheme for
Providers of Telecommunications Services and
Systems that require the use of the Rights-of-
Way, including Providers of both the System and
Service, those Providers of the System only, and
those Providers who do not build the System but
who only provide Services. This Ordinance shall
apply to all future Providers and to all Providers
in the City prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, whether operating with or without a
Franchise as set forth in Chapter 29-12-2.
29-1-8 Excluded Activity. This Ordinance
shall not apply to the following:
(1) Personal Wireless Service Facilities; and,
(2) Providers excused by other law that prohibits
the City from requiring a Franchise shall not be
required to obtain a Franchise, but all of the

Chapter 3. Franchise Required
29-3-1 Non-Exclusive Franchise
29-3-2 Every Provider Must Obtain
29-3-3 Nature of Grant
29-3-4 Current Providers
29-3-5 Nature of Franchise
29-3-6 Regulatory Approval Needed
29-3-7 Term
29-3-1 Non-Exclusive Franchise. The City is
empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive
Franchises governing the installation,
construction, and maintenance of Systems in the
City's Rights-of-Way, in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance. The Franchise is
granted through a Franchise Agreement entered
into between the City and Provider.
29-3-2 Every Provider Must Obtain. Except
to the extent preempted by federal or state law,
as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent
jurisdiction, including any appeals, every
Provider must obtain a Franchise prior to
constructing a Telecommunications System or
providing Telecommunications Services using
the Rights-of-Way, and every Provider must
obtain a Franchise before constructing an Open
Video System or providing Open Video Services
via an Open Video System. Any Open Video
System or Service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection
provisions applicable to the Cable TV companies
to the extent the City is not preempted or
permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of
competent jurisdiction, including any appeals.
The fact the particular Telecommunications
Systems may be used for multiple purposes does
not obviate the need to obtain a Franchise for
other purposes. By way of illustration and not
limitation, a cable operator of a cable system
must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it
intend to provide Telecommunications Services,
over the same System, must also obtain a
Telecommunications Franchise.
29-3-3 Nature of Grant. A Franchise shall not
convey title, equitable or legal, in the Rights-of-
Way. A Franchise is only the right to occupy
Rights-of-Way on a non-exclusive basis for the
limited purposes and for the limited period stated
in the Franchise; the right may not be subdivided,
assigned, or subleased. A Franchise does not
excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before
collocating its System on the property of others,
including the City's property. This section shall
not be construed to prohibit a provider from
leasing conduit to another Provider, so long as
the Lessee has obtained a Franchise.
29-3-4 Current Providers. Except to the
extent exempted by federal or state law, any
Provider acting without a Franchise on the
effective date of this ordinance shall request
issuance of a Franchise from the City within 90
days of the effective date of this Ordinance. If
such request is made, the Provider may continue
providing service during the course of
negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if
negotiations cease and a Franchise is not granted,
the Provider shall comply with the provisions of
Chapter 29-9-4.
29-3-5 Nature of Franchise. The Franchise
granted by the City under the provisions of this
Ordinance shall be a nonexclusive Franchise
providing the right and consent to install, repair,
maintain, remove and replace its System on, over
and under the Rights-of-Way in order to provide
Services, pursuant to all local requirements
outlined in this Ordinance.
29-3-6 Regulator Approval Needed. Before
offering or providing any Services pursuant to
the Franchise, a Provider shall obtain any and all
regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or
licenses for the offering or provision of such
Services from the appropriate federal, state and
local authorities, if required, and shall submit to
the City upon the written request of the City
evidence of all such approvals, permits,
authorizations or licenses.
29-3-7 Term. No Franchise issued pursuant to
this Ordinance shall have a term of less than five
(5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each
Franchise shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory
manner.

29-4-1 Compensation. As fair and reasonable
compensation for any Franchise granted pursuant
to this Ordinance, a Provider shall have the
following obligations:
(1) Application Fee. In order to offset the cost to
the City to review an Application for a Franchise
and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a Provider shall pay to the City, at the
time of Application, a non-refundable
Application fee as set forth from time to time by
City Resolution.
(2) Franchise Fees. The Franchise fee, if any,
shall be set forth in the Franchise Agreement.
The obligation to pay a Franchise fee shall
commence on the Completion Date. The
Franchise fee is offset by any business license
fee or business license tax enacted by the City.
(3) Excavation Permits. The Provider shall also
pay fees required for an excavation permit as
provided in City Code Chapter 25-9, Permit.
29-4-2 Timing. Unless otherwise agreed to in
the Franchise Agreement, all Franchise Fees
shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty-five
(45) days of the close of each calendar month.
29-4-3 Fee Statement and Certification.
Unless a Franchise Agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be
accompanied by a statement showing the manner
in which the fee was calculated and shall be
certified as to its accuracy.
29-4-4 Future Costs. A Provider shall pay to
the City or to third parties, at the direction of the
City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the City incurs for the
services of third parties (including but not limited
to attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or Provider-initiated
renegotiation, or amendment of this Ordinance or
a Franchise, provided, however, that the parties
shall agree upon reasonable financial cap at the
outset of negotiations. In the event the parties are
unable to agree, either party may submit the issue
to binding arbitration in accordance with the
rules and procedures of the American Arbitration
Association. Any costs associated with any work
to be done by the Public Works Department to
provide space on City owned poles shall be
borne by the Provider.
29-4-5 Taxes and Assessments. To the extent
taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing
authorities, other than the City on the use of the
City property as a result of a Provider's use or
occupation of the Rights-of-Way, the Provider
shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata
share of such taxes, payable annually unless
otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees
payable pursuant to this Ordinance.
29-4-6 Interest on Late Payments. In the
event that any payment is not actually received
by the City on or before the applicable date fixed
in the Franchise, interest thereon shall accrue
from such date until received at the rate charged
for delinquent state taxes.
29-4-7 No Accord and Satisfaction. No
acceptance by the City of any fee shall be
construed as an accord that the amount paid is in
fact the correct amount, nor shall such
acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a
release of any claim the City may have for
additional sums payable.
29-4-8 Not in Lieu of Other Taxes or Fees.
The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any
tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically
provided in this Ordinance, or as required by
applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to
obtain space on the City owned poles are not
waived and remain applicable.
29-4-9 Continuing Obligation and Holdover.
In the event a Provider continues to operate all or
any part of the System after the Term of the
Franchise, such operator shall continue to
comply with all applicable provisions of this
Ordinance and the Franchise, including, without
limitation, all compensation and other payment
provisions throughout the period of such
continued operation after the term, including, but
not limited to, damages and restitution.
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 29 Telecommunications Rights-Of-Way
29-4-10 Costs of Publication. A Provider shall
assume any publication costs associated with its
Franchise that may be required by law.

removal of the System shall be performed in a
safe, thorough and reliable manner using
materials of good and durable quality. If, at any
time, it is determined by the FCC or any other

into the Rights-of-Way, if that private easement
grants a superior vested right. This obligation
exists whether or not the Provider has obtained
an excavation permit.

29-8-3 Maintain Records. A Provider shall at

Provider shall maintain complete and accurate
books of account and records of the business,

150
(1) A site plan and architectural approval shall be
required of all uses in Commercial, Manufacturing,
Performance, and R-M Zones prior to issuance of a
building permit; and for all Conditional Use
applications upon submission to the Planning
Commission.
(2) A site plan shall include the following items:
(a) Site plan, drawn to scale, showing main and
accessory building relationships with one another,
open space on the site, buildable areas of lots,
required buffer spaces, easements, rights-of-way, and
all other information necessary for approval of the
site plan.28
(b) Height and bulk of building(s) [elevation
drawing(s)]
(c) Provision for off-street parking spaces and
provisions for the ingress and egress of traffic, also
the traffic circulation within the site. Dwellings in
single family, conventional subdivisions, shall
comply with 28-3-15 (15) 150
(d) Display of any signs in accordance with the
Clinton City Sign Ordinance.
(e) Landscaping.147
(i) Landscape Plan: As part of any proposed
development, the owner or developer shall submit a
landscape plan to the Community Development
Department for approval. All landscaping plans shall
demonstrate conformance with the applicable
requirements contained in this Section.
(ii) Landscape Objectives: Landscaping should
substantively satisfy the following objectives to the
extent that they apply to the specific site:
(A) Landscaping should be encouraged that will
serve the function of enhancing the visual
environment by:
(1) Adding visual interest through texture, color, size
and shape, etc;
(2) Enhancing perspective by framing views,
complementing architecture, screening and creating
points of interest and activity; and
(3) Defining and screening parking areas and
associated access lanes from adjacent residential
zones and public rights of way.
(B) Landscaping, combined with other design
elements, shall be encouraged that will serve the
function of ensuring public safety by:
(1) Guiding the circulation of cars and people;
(2) Controlling access to parking lots;
(3) Making traffic diverters prominent; and
(4) Defining the relative importance of streets by
varying the species, height and location of
landscaping.
(C) Landscaping should be encouraged that will
serve the function of minimizing the nuisance of
noise and glare. Landscaping should be encouraged
that will service the function of conserving energy
by:
(1) Shading hot summer sun; and
(2) Blocking cold winter winds.
(D) Care should be taken to integrate the project to
the site. Landscaping is one tool in carrying out this
thoughtful consideration of the land. Sensitivity to
topography and useful existing vegetation should be
used in determining building location and special
uses. The total landscape should be harmonious with
the overall neighborhood concept.
(E) Preservation of existing landforms and mature
trees is usually desirable.
(F) Visual variety should be the aim of landscaping
treatment. Landscaping should be used to break up
large expanses of pavement.
(G) Species that are a public nuisance or that cause
excess litter should be avoided.
(H) Landscaping and other design elements, such as
pavers, lighting, seating, etc., as deemed appropriate,
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Regulations Applicable to all Zones Chapter 3
Page?3?7

visually obvious and definite entry point or entry
corridor, en-framing views, complementing the
architecture, screening objectionable views and
creating points of interest.

businesses due to convincing documented evidence
that a concentration of sexually oriented businesses
and adult businesses have a deleterious effect on both
the existing business and the surrounding residential
areas adjacent to such sexually oriented businesses,
causing increased crime and a diminution in property
values. To respond to these concerns and an increase
in public concern, the City Council has enacted this
ordinance to restrict sexually oriented businesses as
follows:
(2) Qualification of Location:81, 126 Where the zoning
permits the establishment of a Sexually Oriented

ordinance shall be allowed only in a MP-1 (Light
Manufacturing) Zone as outlined in this code.
(b) No Sexually Oriented Business shall be
established within 600 feet of any civic buildings,
public or private school, church, library, public
playground or park, or 400 feet of any residences,
residential zones, retail establishments and/or as
outlined elsewhere in this code. This distance is to be
measured from the nearest entrance/exit of the
business by following the shortest ordinary
pedestrian route, where sidewalks and crosswalks are
available, or the shortest vehicular travel route along
a public thoroughfare when no sidewalks and
crosswalks are available, to the property boundary of
the above listed protected locations. In no case shall
the above protected locations be any closer than 400
feet measured in a straight line from the nearest
entrance/exit of the business to the nearest property
boundary of the protected location. In no case shall
the property on which a Sexually Oriented Business
is located, be directly adjacent to a property where a
protected location is situated.
(3) Sign Restrictions: The use of signs by a sexually
oriented business shall comply with all requirements
of the Clinton City Sign Ordinance.

guarantee is required under the subdivision Title of
this Code.
(2) Escrow Account, Agreement: A sufficient
financial guarantee shall be provided by the
establishment of a City escrow account for one
hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the estimated cost
of the above required improvements, based on the
actual cost estimate provided by the owner or
developer. The financial guarantee shall provide that
the required improvements be installed upon the
completion of the development or the account funds
may be called by the City to complete the
improvements.
(3) Warranty:
(a) All required improvements shall be warranted by
the property owner for two (2) years from the date of
final inspection approval by the city for all such
improvements.
(b) The City may, as a warranty, either retain fifteen

(4) Effect of Noncompliance on Subsequent
Applications: No building permits shall be issued nor
development approvals given for any expansion,
amendment or subsequent phase of a development, if
the required improvements have not been installed in
accordance with prior permits or approvals for the
site. This prohibition may be waived, if the reviewing
official or body determines the following:
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Regulations Applicable to all Zones Chapter 3
Page?3?20
(a) The approval of the expansion, amendment, or
subsequent phase would result in the removal of the
previously required improvements; and
(b) Any previously required improvements which are
not affected by the proposed expansion, amendment
or subsequent phase have been installed; and
(c) Adequate escrow is provided for the previously
uninstalled required improvements, as well as for any
new required improvements imposed in regards to the
expansion, amendment or subsequent phase.
(5) Installation of Improvements; Completion:
Required improvements shall be installed and
completed before occupancy or use of any building,
structure or improvement approved in regards to the

complete the improvements for the development; or
(d) Exercise any other rights available under the law.
(9) Administrative Procedures: The Community
Development Director may establish procedures
consistent with this Section relating to the

Reduction or Combination. The Board of Zoning
Adjustments may authorize reduction of off-street
parking and loading space as follows:
(1) Reduction in Parking Space: The Board of
Zoning Adjustments may authorize on appeal, a
reduction in the proportions required in this chapter if
it should find that in the particular case, the peculiar
nature of the buildings or premises, or the exceptional
situation or condition would mitigate the need for the
parking spaces as specified in this chapter.
(2) Combine Parking Space: When two dissimilar
uses are located adjacent to each other and the
demand for parking in conjunction with those uses
would not conflict, the Board of Zoning Adjustments
may authorize the use of such combined facilities
requiring the maximum number of parking spaces for
the larger use.
28-4-15 Access to Residential Property Including
Four or Less Dwellings.150, 203, 204 Access to parking
spaces and private garages used in conjunction with

28-4-18 Parking Lot Landscaping.137
(1) Landscaping and Screening: Whenever parking
spaces for five (5) or more cars and their associated
access driveways are located in or near a residential
zone, screening is required to protect residential
properties from potential impacts of lights, noise,
increased pedestrian and automobile traffic, invasions
of privacy and physical intrusions on property. Based
on the applicant's site plan, the department will
determine the potential impacts resulting from
location, site design and layout as they relate to the
areas of concern identified in Table A of this section.
The nature of surrounding topography may be
considered in determining whether impacts exist. The
applicant may then choose from among those
screening options in Table A of this section that are
designed to mitigate identified impacts. The specified
standard for each option is identified in Table B of
this section. Determinations may be appealed to the
Planning Commission. If there are no potential
impacts, screening may not be required. The fencing
and landscaping required under this section shall be
maintained and replaced as needed in order to
provide an effective screen. Whenever a fence abuts a
parking area, tire blocks will be required; the tire
blocks must be set back a minimum of 2 1/2' from the
curb, in order to protect the fence from traffic.
Landscaping shall be protected from automobile
overhang, excluding low growing ground covers and
turf.

28-5-1 Purpose and Intent. The purpose and
intent of this chapter is to establish standards for land
uses listed in each zone as conditional uses.
Conditional uses are generally related to permitted
uses, but due to their unique characteristics or
potential impacts on surrounding uses or the goals of
the City may be appropriate only in certain locations
and under specific conditions that mitigate potential
impacts and may not be compatible in some areas as
impacts cannot be mitigated. Conditional uses are
intended to allow greater flexibility by providing a
wider variety of uses in a zone, while at the same
time allowing conditions to be applied, if conditions
of mitigation or elimination of detrimental impacts
would make the use compatible with surrounding
area.
28-5-2 Conditional Use Permit.
(1) A Conditional Use Permit shall be required for all
uses listed as Conditional Uses in the zone
regulations. A conditional use permit shall be issued
only upon approval of the Planning Commission and
issued to the applicant at the address listed on the
permit and shall not be transferable. The conditional
use permit shall list all requirements determined
appropriate to mitigate the impacts created by the use
in order to make it acceptable at the specific location.
(2) A conditional use permit shall make the approved
use allowable at the specific location and the right of
the approved use with its conditions shall run with
the property, unless the permit has expired as
provided under § 5.08 of this chapter or has been
revoked as provided under § 5.10 of this chapter. In
the event a change is proposed from the conditions of
the original approval, an amendment to the original
conditional use permit shall be required. If the use is
discontinued for a continuous period of one year, a
new conditional use permit is required.
28-5-3 Review Procedure.
(1) Application for a Conditional Use Permit shall be
made to the Planning Commission.
(2) Detailed location, site and building plans shall
accompany the complete application forms provided
by the City.
(3) The application together with all pertinent
information shall be considered by the Planning
Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
(4) The Planning commission shall call a Public
Hearing on any Conditional Use request in
accordance with the requirements of Section 1.04.3
20, 88 of this Title.
(5) Notification of such review shall be sent to the
applicant and all property owners within a 300-foot
radius of the property under review. The notification
shall not be less than seven (7) days prior to the
Conditional Use application review, giving
concerned parties adequate notice of the request to
allow participation and input from all parties.
28-5-4 Determination. The Planning Commission
shall approve a conditional use permit if reasonable
conditions are imposed to mitigate the reasonably
anticipated detrimental effects of the proposed use of
the adjacent properties and the public welfare. If
reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of a
proposal exist, and imposition of reasonable
conditions can not achieve compliance with the
applicable standards, the Commission may deny a
conditional use permit necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and the public welfare.
28-5-5 Basis for Issuance of Conditional Use
Permit. Conditional use applications shall be
reviewed and approved or denied according to the
following criteria:
(1) Detrimental To Persons Or Property: The
proposed use will not, under the circumstances of the
particular case and the conditions imposed, be
detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare
of persons, nor injurious to property and
improvements in the community, existing
surrounding uses, buildings and structures. It shall be
demonstrated that the use and property development:
(a) Does not lead to deterioration of the environment
by emitting pollutants into the ground or air to cause
detrimental effects to the property or neighboring
properties;
(b) Does not introduce hazards or potentials for
damage to neighboring properties that cannot be
mitigated;
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Conditional Uses Chapter 5
Page 5-2
(c) Does not encroach upon rivers or streams or
direct runoff into those features; and
(d) Is in keeping with the type of existing uses
surrounding the property and development as
proposed will improve the character of the area by
encouraging reinvestment and upgrading of
surrounding properties.
(2) General Plan Consistency: The proposed use at
the particular location is consistent with the
objectives and strategies established in the General
Plan.
(3) Use Compatibility: The proposed use at the
particular location is compatible with the character of
the site, adjacent properties, surrounding
neighborhoods and other existing development. In
determining the compatibility of the use with the
surrounding area, the Planning Commission may
consider:
(a) The type of use and its location does not create
unusual pedestrian or vehicle traffic patterns or
volumes that would not be expected with the
development of a permitted use. In determining
unusual patterns, the Planning Commission shall
consider:
(i) the orientation of driveways and if they direct
traffic to the major streets or the local streets and if
directed to the local streets the impact it creates to the
safety, purpose and character of the local street;
(ii) parking locations and size and if they encourage
street-side parking and walking to the proposed use
which impacts the adjacent land uses; and
(iii) hours of peak land use, when traffic to the use
would be greatest and that such times and peaks
would not impact the ability of the surrounding uses
to enjoy the use of their property.
(b) The hours of operation of the proposed use when
compared with the hours of activity of the
surrounding uses and the potential of such hours of
operation do not create noise, light or other nuisances
not acceptable to the enjoyment of the existing
surrounding uses or common to the surrounding uses.
(4) Design Compatibility: The proposed site and
building design and placement at the particular
location is compatible with:
(a) The character of the site in relationship with the
surrounding uses which includes buildings and site
uses integrating with the topography of the site,
retaining trees of value, using natural features as site
amenities, developing landscaping along the public
areas of the property to create an improved
streetscape, reducing expanses of large areas of
asphalt or concrete, and screening objectionable
views that may exist on the site from all surrounding
property owners;
(b) The character of the area by the site design
location of parking lots, access ways, delivery areas
and on-site vehicle circulation patterns taking into
consideration the adjacent uses and not adversely
impacting the adjacent use by exposing them to loss
of privacy, objectionable views of large parking or
storage areas, or views and sounds of loading and
unloading areas;
(c) The character of the surrounding uses by the type
of exterior lighting and signage that will not detract
by being bright or create unwanted light onto
adjacent properties;
(d) the architectural character of the community and
the surrounding neighborhood, considering the
building materials, colors, roof shapes, height, mass,
size and orientation to the proposed building and
design.
(5) Compliance with Regulations: The proposed use
will comply with the regulations and conditions
specified in the Land Use Ordinances.
28-5-6 Appeal.
(1) Decision; When Effective: The decision of the
Planning Commission shall become final and
effective fifteen (15) days after a final decision has
been made by the Planning Commission. However, it
shall not become final if, prior to the expiration of the
fifteen (15) days, any aggrieved person files notice of
appeal with the board of zoning adjustment. The
notice of appeal shall specifically state the
objection(s) to the decision of the Planning
Commission.
(2) Time Limitation: Any person aggrieved by
decision of the Planning Commission may appeal to
the board of zoning adjustment by filing such appeal
with the department within fifteen (15) days after the
final decision of the Planning Commission.
(3) Filing: Said appeal shall be filed in accordance
with the board of zoning adjustment rules of
procedures.
(4) Review: The board of zoning adjustment shall
hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the Planning Commission. The petition
shall provide evidence to the board of zoning
adjustment, to support the specific objections made to
the decision of the Planning Commission.
28-5-7 Building Permit. Upon receipt of a
Conditional Use Permit, the applicant shall take such
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Conditional Uses Chapter 5
Page 5-3
permit to the Building Official, who will review the
permit and conditions attached. Based on this review
and compliance with any other items that might
develop in the pursuance of his duties, the Building
Official may approve an application for a building
permit and shall insure that development is
undertaken and completed in compliance with the
permit and conditions pertaining thereto.
28-5-8 Expiration.
(1) Unless there is substantial action under a
Conditional Use Permit within a period of one year of
its issuance, as determined by the Planning
Commission, the Conditional Use Permit shall
expire. The Planning Commission may grant a
maximum extension of six (6) months under
exceptional circumstances.
(2) An approved conditional use permit shall expire if
a permitted use or a different conditional use replaces
the use allowed under the permit. The conditional use
permit shall also expire if the use is discontinued for
a continuous period of one year. Once the conditional
use permit has expired, a new conditional use permit
shall be required in order to occupy the site.
28-5-9 Re-Review of a Conditional Use Permit.
Once issued, a conditional use permit may be
required to be re-reviewed for the following reasons:
(1) Time limit, which is up to but not beyond every
five (5) years, OR
(2) Receipt of a legitimate complaint.
If a re-review is required the conditional use permit
will follow 5.03.3 & 5.03.4 procedurally.
Notification will include the property owner,
applicant (if different) and all complainants (if any).
28-5-10 Amendment of the Conditional Use
Permit. Once issued, a conditional use permit shall
not be enlarged, changed, extended, increased in
intensity, or relocated except by approval of the
Planning Commission. Application and review of a
proposed amendment to the conditional use permit
shall follow the same procedures as outlined in this
chapter for an original application.
28-5-11 Revocation. A Conditional Use Permit may
be revoked by the Planning Commission for the
following:
(1) Failure to comply with the conditions imposed
with the original approval of the permit,
(2) Abandonment of the use for a continuous period
of one year or longer, or
(3) Any change in the use for which the permit was
issued which may adversely affect the surrounding
area.
Before a permit is revoked, the Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing as outlined in §5.03 4 to
allow sufficient public input. In the case of
abandonment as listed in 2 above, the public hearing
only needs to be held at the discretion of the Planning
Commission.
28-5-12 Appeal of Revocation. The decision of the
Planning Commission concerning the revocation of a
permit may be appealed by any concerned party to
the board of zoning adjustments by filing such appeal
within fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice of
the decision is received by the permit holder. The
board of zoning adjustment may uphold or reverse
the decision of the Planning Commission and impose
any additional conditions that it may deem necessary
in granting an appeal.

28-8-1 Purpose. Applicability: The procedures and
requirements of this Chapter shall apply to and
govern the processing of condominium record of
survey maps pursuant to the requirements of the
Condominium Ownership Act of 1975, Utah Code
Annotated Chapter 57, Chapter 8. Said procedures
and requirements shall supplement zoning, site
development, health, building and other ordinances
applicable to a particular condominium project, and
shall apply to the approval of such projects involving
new construction as well as those involving the
conversion of existing structures. In addition,
condominium projects which contemplate dedication
of real property or improvements for the use of the
public, or condominium projects in which units are
not contained in existing or proposed buildings shall
also be considered subdivisions requiring compliance
with the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
28-8-2 Description; General Limitations.
(1) It is the intent of this Chapter to establish a
reasonable process whereby the City can assess the
impact of mixing collective and individual
ownerships, as presented in a particular condominium
project, upon the public health, safety, welfare,
convenience of the City and to allow flexibility and
diversification in the use of land in the following
zones of Clinton City: PZ, RM and MP-1.
Condominium ownership of spaces may be allowed
as main uses in each of these zones. Uses of the
condominium space shall be limited to those uses
allowed in each zone. Residential development may
also be required to follow those procedures set forth
in Chapter 7 (PRUD Ordinance), Clinton City Zoning
Ordinance. In the case of commercial or residential
conversions of existing buildings, corrections of
Building Code violations, the upgrading of vehicle
parking facilities and safety of common functional
elements of the structure or structures are of prime
importance. A condominium project shall be
considered to be a subdivision, and a record of survey
map or supplement thereto prepared.
(2) Nothing in this Chapter shall be interpreted to
state or imply that a condominium project, unit,
association of unit owners, or management
committee is exempt from compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance, Building and Sanitary Codes, or
similar development regulations which have been
adopted by Clinton City, Davis County, the state of
Utah, or any federal requirements. No condominium
or any record of survey, declaration, or other material
as required for recordation under this Chapter or the
Utah State Condominium Act shall be recorded in the
office of the County Recorder until all attributes of
the condominium project shall have been approved
by Clinton City.

28-9-3 Non-conforming Uses
28-9-4 Non-conforming Certificate
28-9-5 Amortization
28-9-1 Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose of
this chapter to provide for the continual use of any
building, structure or tract of land lawfully
established at the time of passage of the zoning
ordinance, other land use ordinance, or any
amendments thereto, which does not conform to the
present regulations of the zone in which it is located.
It is the intent of this chapter to regulate such uses
and structures in such a manner to lead eventually to
the elimination of non-conforming uses and noncomplying
structures over time and in no way
perpetuate said uses beyond reasonable
abandonment.
28-9-2 Non-complying Structures. A noncomplying
structure, or what has previously been
referred to as a non-conforming building, is any
building or structure that legally existed before its
current land use designation, and because of one or
more subsequent changes to the zoning ordinance, or
other land use ordinance, does not conform to the
setback, height restrictions, or other regulations now
governing the use of land, which regulations
generally include yard regulations, lot coverage or
landscaping requirements, parking regulations
governing the location, design or number of parking
stalls. Non-conformity as to regulations governing
the use of land such as area or density requirements
or parking requirements, established as a minimum
requirement for the use of land in the applicable
zone, shall render any structure located on the land to
be both a non-complying structure and a nonconforming
use. For purposes of this chapter, an
expansion of structure where the use is otherwise
allowed in the applicable zoning district shall be
reviewed under § 2 of this section. If the use is not
otherwise allowed in the applicable zoning district,
the expansion shall be reviewed under § 9.03.2 of this
chapter.
(1) Ordinary Maintenance and Repair: A noncomplying
structure may be maintained or repaired
so long as such work does not increase the noncomplying
or non-conforming conditions of the
building or structure.
(2) Addition or Enlargement:
(a) Authorization; Determination: A non-complying
structure shall not be added to or enlarged in any
manner, unless the Community Development
Director or his appointee, finds that such expansion is
otherwise authorized under § 2b through 2d of this
section, or except by issuance of a non-complying
structure permit by the Planning Commission. In
reviewing a request to expand a non-complying
structure, the Planning Commission shall determine
that:
(i) Granting the expansion will not adversely impact
the attainment of the general plan of the city;
(ii) The expansion will improve the general
appearance or safety of the area;
(iii) By expanding the building, the character of the
neighborhood is not adversely impacted;
(iv) The expansion will improve the area by
providing additional or adequate parking;
(v) Any expansion will be adequately screened or
buffered, if needed, so as not to increase impacts to
the adjoining properties; and
(vi) The expansion will not otherwise violate the
standards established in § 2b through 2d of this
section for any particular type of expansion.
(b) Non-complying as to Height: A main building
non-complying as to height regulations can be
expanded provided the addition meets all required
setbacks of the zone in which it is located and does
not increase any other non-complying or nonconforming
status of the property on which it is
located. If only a portion of the building is noncomplying
as to height then the addition or expansion
must meet the height regulations of the zone in which
it is located. A non-complying accessory building
cannot be enlarged or expanded unless the addition or
expansion complies with the height regulation and
required setbacks of the zone and does not increase
any other non-complying or non-conforming status of
the property on which it is located.
(c) Non-complying as to Setbacks or Yard
Regulations:
(i) A main building non-complying to front yard
setbacks may be expanded and maintain the existing
non-conforming front yard setback provided such
expansion will not displace required parking or
otherwise require a parking variance, or will not
result in the removal of existing landscaping in the
required front yard setback.
(ii) A residential main building with non-complying
side yard setbacks but having a minimum side yard of
not less than three (3) feet, may be extended in depth
along the non-conforming building line to a
maximum of the depth of the existing dwelling if
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Non-Conforming Buildings and Uses Chapter 9
Page 9-2
such extension is for the purpose of enlarging and
maintaining the existing dwelling or required
parking, and provided such enlargement does not
increase any other nonconformity which may exist
and conforms to all other regulations of the zone in
which it is located.
(iii) A main building non-complying to rear yard
setbacks may be expanded provided the expansion
does not increase the non-complying rear yard
setback and does not require any other variance.
(d) Single Family; Expansion Of Parking: A singlefamily
detached dwelling non-conforming as to the
number of properly located off street parking spaces
located on the lot may add additional spaces not to
exceed the minimum required in accordance with the
following standards:
(i) Side Yard Parking With One Legal Stall: If the lot
has at least one properly located off street parking
space, or if no legal off street parking exists and
cannot be developed, then one parking stall may be
constructed in one required side yard; provided, that:
(A) The parking area is at least nine (9) feet wide and
is at least twenty (20) feet in length and that no
portion of the vehicle extending forward of the front
face of the dwelling;
(B) The parking area and its associated driveway
shall be hard surfaced;
(C) The appurtenant driveway to the side yard
parking must be tapered if using an existing driveway
and approach or a new driveway and approach must
be installed to the new parking space;
(D) Any parking in the side yard setback must remain
open and unobstructed to the sky;
(E) All storm water runoff from the hard surface of
the parking area must be directed so as to prevent
drainage onto adjacent properties; and
(F) No parking shall be permitted within the required
side yard facing a street on a corner lot.
(ii) Front Yard Parking: A maximum of two (2) hard
surfaced parking spaces may be added in the front
yard setback, if all of the following standards are
met:
(A) No legal parking has existed on the property and
space is not available, or there is no reasonable
access, to locate legal parking either in the side or
rear yards;
(B) Such space must remain open and unobstructed
to the sky;
(C) No portion of a parked vehicle shall extend
beyond the front property line into the public right of
way;
(D) The parked vehicle shall not exceed eight feet
(8') in width, twenty feet (20') in length, and seven
feet (7') in height; and
(E) The parking area and its associated driveway
shall be hard surface and the parking area shall not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the front yard area.
(iii) Non-conforming or Non-complying as to Lot
Area:
(A) A single-family dwelling with inadequate lot area
in a residentially zoned district shall be allowed to
expand or construct on the lot provided that the
construction will meet required setbacks or has
received the needed setback variances.
(B) A single-family dwelling shall be allowed to be
constructed on a vacant subdivided lot with
inadequate lot area in a residentially zoned district
provided that the construction will meet required
setbacks or has received the needed setback
variances.
(C) A multiple-family dwelling and associated
buildings with inadequate lot area may expand the
buildings or structure on the lot; provided, that:
(a) The construction will meet required setbacks or
has received the needed setback variances; and
(b) The expansion will create covered parking in
areas that are presently paved and used for parking.
(3) Damage or Destruction:
(a) A non-complying structure that is involuntarily
damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire,
flood, wind, earthquake or other natural disaster or
calamity may be restored or rebuilt; provided, that
such restoration is started within a period of one year
and is diligently pursued to completion and the
noncompliance is not increased.
(b) Non-complying structure shall not be rebuilt or
restored if:
(i) The structure is allowed to deteriorate to a
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Non-Conforming Buildings and Uses Chapter 9
Page 9-3
condition that the building is rendered uninhabitable
and a building permit has not been issued to repair or
restore within six (6) months after written notice to
the property owner that the structure is uninhabitable
and that the right to rebuild or restore such noncomplying
structure will be lost if a building permit
has not been issued to repaired or restored within six
(6) months; or
(ii) The property owner has voluntarily demolished
or removed a majority of the non-complying
structure.
28-9-3 Non-conforming Uses. A non-conforming
use is a use of land, including the use of any building
or structure located thereon, that legally existed
before its current land use designation, has been
maintained continuously since the time the land use
ordinance governing the land changed, and because
of one or more subsequent changes to the zoning
ordinance, or other land use ordinance, does not
conform to the regulations that now govern the use of
the land. Nonconformity as to regulations governing
the use of land such as area or density requirements
or parking requirements established as a minimum
requirement for the use of land in the applicable zone
shall render any structure located on the land to be
both a non-complying structure and a nonconforming
use. For purposes of this chapter, an
expansion to such structure where the use is
otherwise allowed in the applicable zoning district
shall be reviewed under § 9.02 2 of this chapter. If
the use is not otherwise allowed in the applicable
zoning district, the expansion shall be reviewed under
§ 2 of this section.
(1) Right of Use: Except as otherwise provided
herein, a non-conforming use may be continued by
the present or any future owner.
(2) Expansion of Use:
(a) Building or Structure:
(i) A non-conforming use may be extended through
the same building or structure provided no structural
alteration of the building is proposed or made for the
purpose of the expansion.
(ii) A building or structure non-conforming as to use
regulations shall not be added to or enlarged in any
manner if the expansion involves any structural
alterations of the building unless the director finds
that such expansion is otherwise authorized under §
9.02 2 of this chapter, or except by issuance of a
non-conforming use permit by the planning
commission. The planning commission shall find
that:
(A) The expansion of the use would not adversely
impact the surrounding properties;
(B) The proposed expansion is compatible with the
surroundings;
(C) The site of the proposed expansion conforms to
all site development requirements as much as
physically possible given existing site limitations;
(D) The proposed expansion shall not create new
nonconformities or conditions of noncompliance; and
(E) No expansion of a non-conforming use shall be
allowed which would extend beyond the original lot
or tract of land.
(b) Land: The non-conforming use of land, not
related to the non-conforming use of a building or
structure, shall not be expanded or extended.
(3) Change of Non-conforming Use: The nonconforming
use of a building or structure may not be
changed to another non-conforming use, except by
issuance of a non-conforming use permit by the
planning commission. No change of use shall be
permitted if the new use is more intensive than the
existing use in its zoning classification and its nature
or character. A use shall be considered to be more
intensive in its zoning classification if it is not
allowed as a permitted use either in the zone where
the existing non-conforming use is first allowed as a
permitted use or in a more restrictive zone. The
planning commission shall find that the proposed
change of use:
(a) Would not adversely impact the surrounding
properties more than the existing non-conforming
use;
(b) Would not intensify the use of the site or impacts
to the neighborhood;
(c) Would not change the character of the existing
building or site unless the change would make the
building or site more compatible with the
surroundings and existing zoning; and
(d) Any site development meets all site development
requirements as much as physically possible, given
existing site limitations.
(4) Damage or Destruction which affects Use: A
building or structure which contains a nonconforming
use and is involuntarily damaged or
destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other
natural disaster or calamity may be restored or rebuilt
and the occupancy or use of such building, structure
or part thereof, which existed at the time of such
destruction, may be continued or resumed; provided,
that such restoration shall be started within a period
of one year and diligently pursued to completion. In
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Non-Conforming Buildings and Uses Chapter 9
Page 9-4
restoring such building or structure, the nonconforming
use shall not be changed, enlarged or
expanded except in accordance with the other
provisions of this chapter and the following:
(a) The reconstruction and reuse of the structure shall
not change the character of the neighborhood by
using construction materials that did not exist
previously on the building; provided that other
building materials may be approved by the director if
the materials are determined to be compatible with
the neighborhood and make the building or site more
compatible with the surroundings;
(b) The reconstruction shall not expand the floor area
of the use, increase its intensity or expand accessory
uses from what had previously existed; and
(c) The new construction shall meet all site
development requirements as much as physically
possible, given existing site limitations and the
existing development before damage occurred.
(5) Loss of Right:
(a) A non-conforming use of a building or structure
shall be terminated if the building or structure in
which the use is located is allowed to deteriorate to a
condition that the structure is rendered uninhabitable
and a building permit has not been issued to repair or
restore within six (6) months after written notice to
the property owner that the structure is uninhabitable
and that the right to rebuild or restore such noncomplying
structure will be lost if a building permit
has not been issued to repair or restore within six (6)
months; or
(b) A non-conforming use of a building or structure
shall be lost if the property owner voluntarily
demolishes a majority of the building or structure that
houses the non-conforming use.
(c) The non-conforming use of a building, structure
or tract of land that has been abandoned shall be
terminated and the building or structure not occupied
or used thereafter except in conformance with the
present use regulations of the zone in which it is
located. Any party claiming that a non-conforming
use has been abandoned shall have the burden of
establishing the abandonment.
(d) A use shall be presumed to be abandoned if:
(i) A majority of the primary structure associated
with the non-conforming use has been voluntarily
demolished;
(ii) The use has been discontinued for a continuous
period of one year; or
(iii) The primary structure associated with the nonconforming
use remains vacant for a continuous
period of one year, excluding vacancies due to:
(A) Remodeling or renovation under a valid building
permit, or
(B) Pending court actions which affect occupancy or
possession of the property, i.e., probate, ownership
disputes.
(e) The property owner may rebut the presumption of
abandonment under § 5d of this section and shall
have the burden of establishing that any claimed
abandonment has not in fact occurred.
(f) The non-conforming status of a school district or
charter school use or structure shall terminate when
the property associated with the school district or
charter school use or structure ceases to be used for
school district or charter school purposes for a
continuous period of one year. Such termination shall
not prevent the reuse of such building or structure
under the other provisions of this chapter.
(6) Reuse of Residential Structures In Residential
Zone: If a right to use land non-conforming as to area
or density requirements of residential uses is lost
pursuant to § 5 of this section, the residential
buildings shall not thereafter be occupied or used
except in conformance with the area or density
requirements of the respective zone, except as
otherwise provided in this section or except as
follows:
(a) The loss of right shall not prohibit the use of an
existing residential building as a single-family
dwelling in any zone permitting said use.
28-9-4 Non-conforming Certificate. The
existence of any non-complying building or nonconforming
use will be recognized by the city
through issuance of a non-complying structure or
non-conforming use certificate. The certificate shall
describe the nature and extent of any noncompliance
or nonconformity. The certificate shall also include
any permits authorizing expansions, additions or
changes of use approved by the director or the
planning commission under the provisions of this title
and any conditions imposed thereon.
(1) Issuance: A non-complying or non-conforming
certificate shall be issued by the director upon the
applicant establishing the existence of the noncomplying
structure or non-conforming use right by a
preponderance of the evidence. Any application for a
non-complying structure or non-conforming use
certificate shall include:
(a) A complete description of the nature and
character of the noncompliance or nonconformity,
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Non-Conforming Buildings and Uses Chapter 9
Page 9-5
including any accessory uses;
(b) A site plan showing all existing buildings,
structures, parking facilities and other improvements
on the applicable lot;
(c) Any evidence the applicant intends to submit to
establish the noncompliance or nonconformity; and
(d) Whether the applicant requests at that time an
administrative hearing for additional submission of
evidence.
(2) Review Procedures:
(a) Except as provided in subsection B4 of this
section, the burden of proving the non-complying
structure or non-conforming use shall be upon the
applicant. The director may investigate the accuracy
or credibility of any information submitted and may
conduct its own investigation into any facts
pertaining to the existence or nonexistence of the
non-complying structure or non-conforming use.
(b) Once the application has been submitted and
reviewed, the director shall, within a reasonable
period of time, either approve issuance of the
certificate, request additional information, or deny
the application stating the reasons for denial. The
applicant may request an administrative hearing
within fifteen (15) days of the mailing of the decision
on the application. The hearing shall be held at a time
and place to be determined by the director after
notice to the applicant.
(c) The decision of the director shall be considered to
be a final administrative order or decision, subject to
appeal to the board of zoning adjustment.
(3) Expansions, Additions, Or Changes Of Noncomplying
Structures Or Non-conforming Uses:
(a) No expansions, additions or changes of a noncomplying
structure or non-conforming use under §
9.02 and § 9.03 of this chapter shall be approved
unless and until a non-complying structure or nonconforming
use certificate has been issued as
described above.
(b) Any non-complying structure or non-conforming
use permit approving an expansion or change shall
become a part of the original certificate and subject to
any conditions placed thereon.
(c) Any approval granted by the planning
commission or the director for an expansion, addition
or change of a non-complying structure or nonconforming
use shall expire if, within a one year
period, there is no substantial action taken to
complete the change or expansion.
(d) The permit portion of a non-complying structure
or non-conforming use certificate issued for an
expansion, addition or change may be revoked by the
issuing body if any of the conditions or terms are
violated. The holder of the certificate shall first be
afforded an opportunity to be heard before the board
or commission, as applicable, and show cause why
the certificate should not be revoked. In addition, a
violation of a condition or term of the certificate shall
constitute a violation of this title, and the revocation
of a certificate shall not prohibit any other remedy
provided herein.
(4) Revocation; Incorrectly Issued Certificate: A noncomplying
structure or non-conforming use
certificate may be revoked by the director if the
director determines that such certificate was
incorrectly issued due to mistake, misrepresentation,
or the discovery of new evidence demonstrating that
the rights of a non-complying structure or nonconforming
use did not exist. Notice of revocation
shall be mailed to the owner of the property, and at
the address, as shown in the records of the Davis
County recorder's office. The property owner may
request an administrative hearing within thirty (30)
days of the mailing of the notice of revocation. Said
hearing shall be held at a time and place to be
determined by the director after notice to the owner.
If a hearing is not requested, or if the director
determines after hearing that the notice of revocation
should not be rescinded, the director's decision to
revoke shall be considered to be a final
administrative determination. A decision that the
permit should be revoked shall not restrict the right of
the property owner to make further application for a
non-complying structure or non-conforming use
permit after presentation of additional evidence or
information.
(5) Building Permit: After the effective date hereof,
no building permit shall be issued which
encompasses any non-conforming use or noncomplying
building without the prior issuance and
except in accordance with the terms and conditions of
a non-conforming or non-complying certificate. The
city shall continue to recognize any non-conforming
use or non-complying building previously approved,
but the character, nature and extent of the nonconforming
use or non-complying building must
hereafter be documented through the application and
certificate issuance process described in this section.
(6) Loss Of Right; Procedure: If it has been
determined by the director that a loss of a nonconforming
use or non-complying structure right has
occurred under the provisions of this chapter, the
director shall notify the owner of the property, and at
the address, as shown in the records of the Davis
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Non-Conforming Buildings and Uses Chapter 9
Page 9-6
County recorder's office, that the loss of nonconforming
or non-complying rights has occurred.
The owner may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of
said notice, request a hearing before the director to
present any evidence or reasons why the certificate
should not be revoked. If, after the hearing, the
director determines that the right has been lost, the
decision shall be considered to be a final
administrative order or decision, subject to appeal to
the board of zoning adjustment.
28-9-5 Amortization. The provisions of this
chapter are not intended to restrict the city council's
authority under section 10-9a-511, Utah Code
Annotated, to terminate all non-conforming uses, by
providing a formula establishing a reasonable time
period during which the owner can recover or
amortize the amount of his or her investment in the
non-conforming use, if any.

which the variance is sought; and
(B) Comes from circumstances peculiar to the
property, not from conditions that are general to the
neighborhood.

zoning ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship

28-14-1 Purpose and Intent. The purposes of the
R-1 Zones are to provide regulated areas for singlefamily
residential use at varied density levels and to
provide density buffers between existing Agricultural
Estate Zones and residential uses in the agricultural
zone. Included in these zones are provisions for a
wider choice of residential housing styles needing
varied lot sizes, through the use of conventional
subdivision designs, averaging of lot sizes and
frontages, while enhancing the advantages of
individual home ownership. It is not the intent that
these zones become areas for the keeping,
maintaining, feeding, etc. of animal or fowl units as
defined in this ordinance.
28-14-2 Uses. 169, 170, 181, 182, 199
(1) Permitted and conditional uses for each zone are
outlined in Table 14.2.
(2) All Conditional Uses shall be processed as
outlined in Chapter 5 of this ordinance.
28-14-3 Site Development Standards. 149, 169 Site
development standards for all R-1 Zones are outlined
in Table 14.3.
28-14-4 Averaging Standards. Subdivisions, where
averaging is permitted, developed within these zones
will be evaluated throughout the approval process
based upon the use of lot and width averaging in
respect to the intent and purpose of these zones as
stated herein, and the following guidelines:
(1) Corner lots are not to be included in any averages.
(2) Lot sizes will be interspersed throughout the
subdivision unless specific sizes concentrated within
one area are required for buffering. In the R-1-15
Zone a minimum of 50% of interior lots will meet the
95 foot frontage requirement.
(3) The averaging plan for a subdivision will be
approved during the preliminary plat approval
process and will not be changed without reevaluation
of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission.
In the R-1-15 Zone the accumulated average lot size
for the first and subsequent phases within the
subdivision shall not be lower than required.
28-14-5 Special Provisions for R-1-6 Zone. 1
(1) Minimum area of zone - 10 acres.
(2) The City may require park land dedication as
authorized by the Clinton City Municipal Code, Title
24 Chapter 1.6
28-14-6 Special Provisions for Development
Adjacent to the Performance Zone. 123
(1) Any subdivision developing next to a vacant
parcel located within the Performance Zone will
provide, as a minimum, a fifteen (15) foot buffer
easement and a six-foot high chain link fence
constructed to city standards next to the vacant land.
(2) The intent of this additional space is for it to be
utilized as a buffer with additional vegetation, to be
installed by the homeowner, it desired whenever the
vacant land is developed with a non-compatible use.
(3) The buffer easement will not be utilized for
structures of other use which would interfere with the
possible development of a landscape buffer. 125
(4) All setback requirements established in this
ordinance shall be measured from the buffer
easement and not from the property line.
(5) Buffer easements may be used in conjunction
with the public utility and drainage easement required
in the Clinton City Subdivision Ordinance.

a A decibel is a measure of a unit of sound pressure.
Since sound waves having the same decibel level
"sound" louder or softer to the human ear depending
upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles-persecond
(i.e., whether the pitch of the sound is high or
low) an A-weighted filter constructed in accordance
with the specifications of the American national
Standards Institute, which automatically takes
account of the varying effect on the human ear of
different pitches, shall be used on any sound level
meter taking measurements required by this section.
All measurements are expressed in dB(A) to reflect
the use of the A-weighted filter.
(4) Vibration:
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Light Manufacturing (MP-1) Chapter 18
Page 18-2
(a) No permitted or conditional use may generate any
ground-transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the
human sense of touch measured at:
(b) The outside boundary of the immediate space
occupied by the enterprise generating the vibration if
the enterprise is one of several located on a lot.
(i) The lot line if the enterprise generating the
vibration is the only enterprise located on a lot.
(ii) Vibrations resulting from temporary construction
activity that occurs between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. shall
be exempt from the requirements of this section.
(5) Odors:
(a) For the purpose of this section, the "odor
threshold" is defined as the minimum concentration
in air of a gas, vapor, or particulate matter that can be
detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of
healthy observers.
(b) No permitted or conditional use in the MP-1
District may generate any odor that reaches the odor
threshold, measured at:
(i) The outside boundary of the immediate space
occupied by the enterprise generating the odor if the
enterprise is one of several located on a lot.
(ii) The lot line if the enterprise generating the odor is
the only enterprise located on a lot.
(6) Air Pollution:
(a) Any permitted or conditional use that emits any
"air contaminant" as defined in the state statutes shall
comply with applicable state standards concerning air
pollution, as set forth in the Air Conservation Act
§19-2-101 Utah Code Unannotated.
(b) No use shall be permitted with respect to
development or operation until the State Air Quality
Board has certified to Clinton City that the
appropriate state permits have been received by the
developer, or that the developer will be eligible to
receive such permits and that the development is
otherwise in compliance with air pollution laws.
(7) Disposal of Liquid Wastes:
(a) No permitted or conditional use may discharge
any waste contrary to the provisions of Utah Law
governing discharges of radiological, chemical, or
biological wastes into surface or subsurface waters.
(b) Or, discharge into the city sewage system any
waste that cannot be adequately treated by the North
Davis County Sewer District.
(c) No use shall be permitted with respect to
development or operation until the North Davis

that the appropriate District permits have been
received by the developer, or that the developer will
be eligible to receive such permits and that the
development is otherwise in compliance with District
standards.
(8) Water consumption: No permitted or conditional
use that requires for its operation a supply of treated
culinary water shall be permitted with respect to
development or operation until the City has certified
the results of the demands upon the city system.
(9) Electrical Disturbance or Interference:
(a) No permitted or conditional use may create any
electrical disturbance that adversely affects any
operations or equipment other than those of the
creator of such disturbance.
(b) Or, otherwise cause, create, or contribute to the
interference with electronic signals (including
television and radio broadcasting transmissions) to
the extent that the operation of any equipment not
owned by the creator of such disturbance is adversely

(10) Landscaping Requirements. 149
See Section 3.20 and 4.18 for details
(11) On Site Exterior Lighting Standards
(a) PURPOSE:
(i) The purpose of this section is to regulate the spillover
of light and glare on operators of motor
vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses in the proximity
of the light source. With respect to motor vehicles in
particular, safety considerations from the basis of the
regulations contained herein. In other cases, both the
nuisance and hazard aspects of glare are regulated.
This section is not intended to apply to public street
lighting.
(b) DEFINITIONS:
(i) Candlepower: the amount of light that will
illuminate a surface one (1) foot distant from a light
source to an intensity of one (1) foot-candle.
Maximum (peak) candlepower is the largest amount
of candlepower emitted by any lamp, light source, or
luminaire.
(ii) Cutoff: The point at which all light rays emitted
by a lamp, light source, or luminaire are completely
eliminated (cutoff) at a specific angle above the
ground.
(iii) Cutoff Angle: the angle formed by a line
drawn from the direction of light rays at the light
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Light Manufacturing (MP-1) Chapter 18
Page 18-3
source and line perpendicular to the ground from the
light source, above which no light is emitted.
(iv) Cutoff-type Luminaire: a luminaire with
elements such as shields, reflectors, or refractor
panels which direct and cut off the light at a cutoff
angle that is less than ninety (90) degrees.
(v) Foot-candle: a unit of illumination produced on
a surface, all points of which are one (1) foot from a
uniform point source of one (1) candle.
(vi) Glare: the brightness of a light source which
causes eye discomfort.
(vii) Luminaire: a complete lighting unit consisting
of a light source and all necessary mechanical,
electrical, and decorative parts.
(viii) Maximum Permitted Illumination: The
maximum illumination measured in foot-candles at
the interior bufferyard line at ground level in
accordance with the standards of Subsection (3)
below.
(c) The following standards are required of all
exterior lighting except the outdoor recreational uses
specifically exempted below. Many uses have the
option of providing a lower light post with a noncutoff
type luminaire or a higher pole, up to sixty
(60) feet, with a luminaire that totally cuts off light
spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than ninety (90)
degrees.
(i) The maximum height light post permitted is
dependent on amount of cutoff provided. This is
designed as a protection against excessive glare and
light spilling over to neighboring properties. The
exceptions which are permitted provide adequate
protection for neighboring residential property.
(ii) Exterior lighting shall meet one (1) of the
standards outlined in Tables 18.3, 18.4 or 18.5.
(d) Additional Regulations. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this section to the contrary:
(i) No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted
(ii) Light sources or luminaries shall not be located
within bufferyard areas except on pedestrian
walkways.
(e) Measurement.
(i) Metering equipment. Lighting levels shall be
measured in foot-candles with a direct-reading,
portable light meter. The meter shall have a color
and cosine-corrected sensor with multiple scales and
shall read within an accuracy of plus or minus five
(5) percent. It shall have been tested, calibrated, and
certified by an independent commercial photometric
laboratory or the manufacturer within one (1) year of
the date of its use.
(ii) Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall
be mounted not more than (6) inches above ground
level in a horizontal position. Readings shall be
taken by qualified personnel only after the cell has
been exposed long enough to provide a constant
reading. Measurements shall be made after dark with
the light sources in question on, then with the same
sources off. The difference between the two readings
shall be compared to the maximum permitted
illumination at property line at ground level in
Section 18.15. This procedure eliminates the effects
of moonlight and other ambient light.
(f) Exterior Lighting Plan
(i) At the time any exterior lighting is installed or
substantially modified, and whenever a site plan
approval is sought, an exterior lighting plan shall be
submitted to the City in order to determine whether
the requirements of this section have been met.
28-18-5 Permitted Uses.
(1) Storage and display of goods outside fully
enclosed building within a fully fenced area.

the planting units required of bufferyards have been
calculated to insure that they do, in fact function as
"buffers". Bufferyards shall be required to separate
different land uses form each other in order to
eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as
dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly
buildings or parking areas, or to provide spacing to
reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger
from fires or explosions.

(2) If the development on the adjoining use is
existing, planned, or deed-restricted for solar access,
understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees
where canopy trees would destroy solar access.
(3) Any existing plant material which otherwise
satisfies the requirements of this section may be
counted toward satisfying all such requirements.
(4) The exact placement of required plants and
structures shall be the decision of each user except
that evergreen (or conifer) plant materials shall be
planted in clusters rather than singly in order to
maximize their chances of survival.
(5) All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with grass
and provided with a means of watering.
28-18-11 Use of Bufferyards. A bufferyard
may be used for passive recreation; it may contain
pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails, provided that: a.
No plant material is eliminated, b. the total width of
the bufferyard is maintained, and c. all other
regulations of the ordinance are met. In no event,
however shall the following uses be permitted in
bufferyards: ice skating rinks, playfields, ski hills,
stables, swimming pools, and tennis courts.
28-18-12 Contractual Reduction of
Bufferyard Abutting Vacant Land. When a land
use is proposed adjacent to vacant land which is in
another zone, and the owner of that vacant land
enters into a contractual relationship with the owner
of the land that is to be developed first, a reduced
buffer may be provided by that first use, provided
that:
(1) The contract contains a statement by the owner of
the vacant land of an intent to develop at no greater
than a specified land use intensity class; and
(2) The vacant landowner makes an agreement to
assume all responsibility for additional buffer, if
needed, by his development of a less intense use than
had been agreed upon.

Design Standards and Guidelines 123
28-19-1 Legislative Intent. In enacting this chapter
of the zoning ordinance, special notice has been taken
of the fact that the goals of citizens and landowners
of Clinton often conflict or compete. The prior
method of zoning regularly forced a "winner-take-all"
solution to the resolution of conflicts between
neighbors or adjoining property owners. Whenever a
proposed commercial use encountered objections, the
City Council had only two choices: either to permit
the use, to the detriment of the objectors, or to
prohibit it entirely, to the detriment of the landowner
who proposed it. Whenever a use was permitted
(usually by virtue of a rezoning), the preexisting
adjacent users were largely unprotected from any of
its negative impacts. This chapter has been designed
to protect and accommodate both competing interests.
This has inevitably, and properly, led to some form of
compromise. In arriving at these compromises, every
possible consideration has been given to the public
interest, individual property rights, and externalities.
While compromise implies mutual concessions or
losses, it also implies - and this chapter has been
designed to provide - mutual gains and benefits. It is
the goal of this chapter that both the burdens and the
benefits which it, like any scheme of public
regulation, implies be rationally and fairly distributed
among the citizens and property owners of Clinton.
28-19-2 Establishment of Economic Development
Zone. This zone is intended to accommodate most of
the economic development expected in Clinton
during the next twenty-year period. It consists of the
areas where economic development should logically
locate as a consequence of planned public facilities
and associated capital expenditure. This zone
provides for development of a generally suburban
character. It provides for necessary commercial and
institutional uses. 123
28-19-3 Introduction. The purpose of the
regulations contained in this chapter is to allow
maximum utilization of land in the zone while
insuring against detrimental impacts on the
environment, neighboring properties, and the public
interest. This regulatory approach has been termed
"performance zone" because it permits a use to be
developed on a particular parcel only if that use on
that parcel meets "performance" standards which
have been enacted to insure against the use causing
(or having the potential to cause) the negative
impacts mentioned above.
The format of the regulations in this chapter differs
somewhat from that of the rest of the ordinance
because performance zoning requires that
consideration be given to site (parcel) characteristics
and the range of impacts which any use (such as
"office" or "retail store") may have.
(1) Definitions.28, 123
High Volume Traffic Generation. Any business
that generates in excess of 100 vehicle trips per hour.
As part of any conditional use review or site plan
review a traffic study may be required by staff or the
Planning Commission.69, 88
Low-Volume Traffic Generation. Uses such as
furniture stores, carpet stores, major appliance stores,
etc. that are large and bulky, that need a relatively
large amount of storage or display area for each unit
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-2
offered for sale, and that therefore generate less
customer traffic per square foot of floor than stores
selling smaller items.69
Site Area, Base. The area of proposed
development minus rights-of-way, existing roads,
easements, etc. as outlined in 28-19-9.
Site Area, Gross. The entire acreage of a
proposed development.
Site Area, Net. The area of a proposed
development after subtracting required open spaces
as outlined in 28-19-10.
28-19-4 Use Regulations. 182 In the following list of
uses, those designated as "P" will be permitted use.
Uses designated "C" will be allowed only when
authorized by a conditional use permit obtained as
provided in Chapter 5 of this Zoning Ordinance.

28-19-6 Zoning District Performance Standards.
Sections 19.6 and 19.7 delineate the minimum
standards for open space, density, impervious surface
coverage, and lot area which apply in this zone. The
purpose of these performance standards is to provide
detailed regulations and restrictions by means of
minimum criteria which must be met by uses in order
to protect neighbors from adverse impacts of
adjoining land uses and to protect the general health,
safety, and welfare by limiting where uses may be
established, insuring that traffic congestion is
minimized, controlling the intensity of use, and
prescribing other such performance criteria necessary
to implement the Comprehensive Plan and to meet
the goals and objectives of this chapter. All uses and
activities shall comply fully with the provisions of
the following standards as a precondition of being
permitted pursuant to Table 19.4.
28-19-7 Performance Standards. 123 This section
contains the range of basic standards applicable to the
uses allowed by this chapter. All standards must be
met. Whenever the standard contained in 28-19-7 is
different from another performance standard
articulated in this chapter, the strictest standard shall
always govern. The floor area factor is the amount of
floor area of a building compared with the net
buildable site area. The minimum site area specifies
the minimum total number of acres for which
development of a particular use may be proposed.
Specific standards are dependent upon the intensity
of development as outlined in 28-19-14.
28-19-8 Sight Capacity Calculation: Purpose. 123
Site capacity for any proposed development is equal
to the net buildable area of the site multiplied by the
floor area factor or impervious surface ratio,
whichever is more restrictive. The site capacity
calculation provides the mechanism for subtracting
from the base site area all portions of a site
inappropriate for development. Consequently, the
purpose of this section is to determine the extent to
which a site may be utilized given its unique physical
characteristics.

28-19-11 Open Space.
(1) Land which is required by this chapter to remain
as open space may be used for the recreation,
agriculture, resource protection, amenity and other
purposes specified in this section. Open-space land
shall be freely accessible to all intended users of a
development with the exception that agricultural land
uses shall be permitted to restrict access to that land
to those solely engaged in agricultural pursuits.
Open-space land shall not be occupied by nonrecreational
buildings, roads, road right-of-way or
parking areas. 123
(2) All developments required by this chapter to
provide open space shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Land designated as open space shall be
maintained as open space and may not be separately
sold, subdivided, or developed except as provided
below.
(b) An open-space plan shall be submitted as a part of
the application for site plan approval. This plan shall
designate and indicate the boundaries of all openspace
areas required by this ordinance. The plan
shall:
(a) Designate areas to be reserved as open space. The
specific design of open-space areas shall be sensitive
to the physical and design characteristics of the site.
(b) Designate the type of open space which will be
provided.
(c) Specify the manner in which the open space shall
be perpetuated, maintained, and administered.
(c) The types of open space which may be provided
to satisfy the requirements of this ordinance, together
with the maintenance required for each type, are as
follows:
(a) Agricultural uses. No specific maintenance is
required.
(b) Greenways are linear green belts linking
residential areas with other open-space areas. These
greenways may contain bicycle paths, footpaths, and
bridle paths. Connecting greenways between
residences and recreational areas are encouraged.
Maintenance is limited to a minimum removal and
avoidance of hazards, nuisances, or unhealthy
conditions.
(c) Lawns consist of grass with or without trees.
Maintenance is limited to watering and mowing to
insure neatness.
(d) Interim open space. Land intended for future
development may be designated as a holding zone
and thus remains vacant until such time as this land is
annexed or rezoned as a development district.
(d) All designated open space shall be large enough
to be useable open space. The minimum dimension
for usable open space shall be (10) feet and the
minimum area shall be one hundred (100) square feet.
(3) Preservation of open space. Open-space areas
shall be maintained so that their use and enjoyment as
open space are not diminished or destroyed. Openspace
areas may be owned, preserved, and
maintained as required by this section by any of the
following mechanisms or combinations thereof:
(a) Dedication of open space to the City or an
appropriate public agency, if there is a public agency
willing to accept the dedication.
(b) Common ownership of the open space by a
homeowner's association which assumes full
responsibility for its maintenance.
(c) Dedication of development rights of open space
may be made to an appropriate public agency with
ownership remaining with the developer or
homeowner's association. Maintenance responsibility
shall remain with the property owner.
(d) Deed-restricted private ownership which shall
prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision
of the open-space land and provide the maintenance
responsibility.
In the event that any private owner of open space
fails to maintain same according to the standards of
this ordinance, Clinton City may, in accordance with
the Open-Space Plan and following reasonable notice,
demand that deficiency of maintenance be corrected,
enter the open space to maintain same. The cost of
such maintenance shall be charged to those persons
having the primary responsibility for maintenance of
the open space.
28-19-12 Land Use Intensity Classification
and Bufferyards.
(1) All land uses which are permitted by this chapter
have been assigned a land use intensity class
designation (see 28-19-14). This classification
system separates uses on the basis of the type and
degree of "nuisance" or negative impact they are
likely to impose on land uses adjacent to them.
(2) In order to minimize any negative effects that a
more obnoxious or intensive use will impose on its
neighbors, this ordinance requires that bufferyards be
provided between uses.
28-19-13 Land Use Intensity Class
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-9
Standards. In keeping with the concept that
performance should be the relevant measure of any
land use regulations, the following section classifies
uses according to their respective impact (all uses
within a use class are considered to have an equal
impact on neighboring uses). A developer may
develop at an intensity which will minimize
nuisances to neighbors or provide a denser bufferyard
if the land is developed at greater intensities. The
impacts of greater intensity may include greater
impervious surface coverage, with associated
increased runoff, heat generation, reduced percolation
and open space, increased bulk and height of
buildings, increased traffic with associated noise and
congestion, signs and exterior lighting visible from
neighboring property, late hours of operation, and
other nuisances. Thus, for example, and office use
on any lot may meet the standards at intensity class
IV, V, VI, VII, or VIII. The range of intensity
classes open to a use does not affect whether it can
locate on its lot, but only how it can develop on that
lot. Performance standards are specified for each
intensity class; exceeding any single standard in an
intensity class moves a use to the next-higher
intensity class. In the event that a use does not
appear in the next-higher intensity class, it may not
exceed any single criteria in the highest intensity
class in which it is listed.

28-19-15 Bufferyards: Purpose.
(1) The bufferyard is a unit of yard together with the
planting required thereon. Both the amount of land
and the type and amount of planting specified for
each bufferyard requirement of this ordinance are
designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent
land uses or between a land use and a public road.
The planting units required of bufferyards have been
calculated to insure that they do, in fact function as
"buffers".
(2) Bufferyards shall be required to separate different
land uses form each other in order to eliminate or
minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise,
glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or
parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse
impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or
explosions.
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-12
28-19-16 Location of Bufferyards. 163 164
(1) To determine the type of bufferyard required
between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and
a street, the following procedure shall be followed.
(a) Identify the land use category of the proposed use
by referring to Table 19.4.
(b) Identify the use category of the land use(s)
adjacent to the proposed use by on-site survey.
(c) Identify the land use intensity class of all
adjoining land uses by referring to Table 19.14.
Clinton City will supply this information.
(d) Classify any street adjacent to the proposed use
by referring to the Clinton City Transportation
Master Plan.
(e) Determine the bufferyard required on each
boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel
by referring to Table 19.17.
(2) 28-19-18 specifies the bufferyard required
between adjacent land uses. The requirements are
expressed in terms which are further described and
detailed in 28-19-18 through 28-19-22.
(3) Bufferyard specifications are detailed and
illustrated in Table 19.18.2. The bufferyards
illustrated constitute the total bufferyard required
between the two adjacent land uses. Any of the
options contained in Table 19.18.2 for the required
bufferyard shall satisfy the requirement of buffering
between adjacent land uses.
(4) Responsibility for bufferyards.
(a) When a use is the first to develop on two adjacent
vacant parcels, this first use, if it is other than a
commercial or office use shall provide the buffer
which Section 19.18 requires next to a commercial
use with a Class VIII land use intensity classification.
123
(b) When a commercial or office use is developed
adjacent to a vacant parcel, no buffering is required.
(c) The second use to develop shall, at the time it
develops, provide all additional plant material and/or
land necessary to provide the total bufferyard
required between those two uses by 28-19-18. 28
(d) Any development within the Performance Zone
located against an adjacent vacant parcel in a
residential zone, this first use, shall provide the buffer
which Section 19.18 requires next to a residential use
with a Class III land use intensity classification. 123
(e) Existing plant material and/or land located on the
preexisting (first developed) land use which meets
the requirements of this chapter
(f) May be counted as contributing to the total
bufferyard required between it and the second
(adjacent) land use to develop.
(5) Streetscape Landscaping Requirements. The
requirements mentioned in this section do not in any
way supersede those found within Chapter 4 of this
title with regards to parking lot screening, but are to
help enhance the streetscape. The landscaping along
the street can be included in the calculation for
landscaping requirements.
(a) Specifications for bufferyards required against
adjoining streets are stipulated in Table 19.16.1.
(b) During the Site Plan Review the Planning
Commission will evaluate pedestrian access through
required buffer areas to ease access between the
development and the public way. As a minimum
placement of this access will evaluate slope,
construction, texture, snow removal, safety, and
continued access from the area of the buffer to
structures.
(c) If the planning commission determines that a
fence is necessary to be part of a street buffer, due to
public safety, fences will be of a decorative nature
selected from the F-#W, wrought iron, type fences or
F-2B berms. If a fence is required the buffer can be
deleted in width by 5-feet, however at no time will
the buffer be less than 10-feet deep.
(d) Buffers at corners. In order to facilitate the sight
triangle, where buffers meet at intersection corners
the minimum depth of the corner buffer will be equal
to the larger buffer for a distance of 40-feet from the
corner.
(e) Where a development includes a public right-ofway
to be developed as a street both sides of the street
will be developed with a buffer. If there is property
adjacent to the right-of-way that is not part of the
development the buffer on that side of the street will
be developed with either a street buffer or a
bufferyard standard whichever is the greater.
(f) EXCEPTIONS to the streetscape landscaping
requirements shall apply only to the location of the
parking area and not that of the building. 165
(a) Reduction of the depth requirement on adjacent
streets may be reduced from one (1) to, but not
beyond, five (5) feet if it is determined that the
evaluation of the Architecture of the building
elevations has received at least a positive score.
(b) Reduction of the depth requirement on adjacent
streets may be reduced from one (1) to, but not
beyond, five (5) feet if it is determined that the
evaluation of the landscaping features (water features,
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19

rock work, additional landscaping, and other
significant features [refer to 28-20-6 (3) for
examples], etc.) to receive at least a positive
evaluation by significantly exceeding the minimum
requirements.
(c) Use table 19.16.2 when evaluating both the
Architectural reductions and the Streetscape
landscaping reductions.

(1) The following illustrations graphically indicate
the specifications of each bufferyard. Bufferyard
requirements are stated in terms of width of the
bufferyard and the number of plant units required per
one hundred (100) linear feet of bufferyard. The
requirements of a bufferyard may be satisfied by any
of the options thereof illustrated. The "plant unit
multiplier" is a factor by which the basic number of
plant materials required for a given bufferyard is
determined given a change in the width of that yard.
The type and quantity of plant materials required by
each bufferyard, and each bufferyard option, are
specified in this section.

only three options within the
required bufferyard, then the
largest bufferyard must be used.
(2) Each illustration depicts the total bufferyard
located between two uses. However, where
bufferyards are required against residential units or a
residential zone the minimum bufferyard will have a
minimum 6 chain link fence, to meet city standards
located on the property line between the bufferyard
and residencies/residential zone. Where a fence is
required the type of fence shall be upgraded one step
to further protect the residential use, i.e. F2 will be
installed as a F3, F4, as a F5.
(3) Whenever a wall, fence, or berm is required
within a bufferyard, these are shown as "structure
required" in the following illustrations, wherein their
respective specifications are also shown.
(4) The following plant material substitutions shall
satisfy the requirements of this section.
(a) In bufferyards F, G, H, and I, evergreen canopy or
evergreen understory trees may be substituted for
deciduous canopy forest trees without limitation.
(b) In bufferyards A, B, C, D, E, and G, evergreen
canopy or evergreen understory trees may be
substituted as follows:
(a) In the case of deciduous canopy forest trees, up to
a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the total number
of the deciduous canopy trees otherwise required.
(b) In the case of deciduous understory, without
limitation.
(c) In all bufferyards, evergreen or conifer shrubs
may be substituted for deciduous shrubs without
limitation.
(d) In all bufferyards required of public service uses,
the public service use may substitute evergreen
canopy or evergreen understory plant materials for
canopy forest trees and understory plant materials,
without limitation.
(e) If the development on the adjoining use is
existing, planned, or deed-restricted for solar access,
understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees
where canopy trees would destroy solar access.
(f) Any existing plant material which otherwise
satisfies the requirements of this section may be
counted toward satisfying all such requirements.
(g) The exact placement of required plants and
structures shall be the decision of each user except
that the following requirements shall be satisfied:
(a) Evergreen (or conifer) class III and IV plant
materials shall be planted in clusters rather than
singly in order to maximize their chances of survival.
(b) Berms with masonry walls (BW1, BW2, and BW3)
required of bufferyard I are intended to buffer more
significant nuisances from adjacent uses and,
additionally, to break up and absorb noise, which is
achieved by the varied heights of plant materials
between the masonry wall and the noise source.
(c) All bufferyard areas shall be seeded with grass
and provided with a means of watering.
(5) The bufferyards as established within table
19.18.2 represent all of the options available for
every development. However, the minimum required
bufferyard changes depending on the depth of the
development. Use table 19.18.1 to determine the
minimum bufferyard allowed per depth of
development.

28-19-19 Use of Bufferyards. 151, 153
(1) A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation;
it may contain pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails,
provided that:
(a) No plant material is eliminated,
(b) The total width of the bufferyard is maintained,
and
(c) All other regulations of the ordinance are met.
(2) In no event, however the following uses be
permitted in bufferyards: ice skating rinks, playfields,
stables, swimming pools, and tennis courts.
28-19-20 Ownership of Bufferyards.
Bufferyards may remain in the ownership of the
original developer (and assigns) of a land use, or they
may be subject to deed restrictions and subsequently
be freely conveyed, or they may be transferred to any
consenting grantees, such as adjoining landowners,
City, or an open-space or conservation group,
provided that any such conveyance adequately
guarantees the protection of the bufferyards for the
purposes of this ordinance.
28-19-21 Excess Bufferyards. Where the
bufferyard required between a land use and vacant
land turns out to be greater than that bufferyard
which is required between the first use and the
subsequently developed use, the following options
apply:
(1) The subsequent use may provide one half (.5) of
the buffer required by 28-19-17 and 28-19-18. The
existing use may expand its use into the original
buffer area, provided that the resulting total
bufferyard between the two uses meets the bufferyard
requirements of 28-19-17 and 28-19-18.
(2) The existing use may enter into agreements with
abutting landowners to use its existing buffer to
provide some or all of the required bufferyard of both
land uses. The total buffer shall equal the
requirements of 28-19-17 and 28-19-18. Provided
that such an agreement can be negotiated, the initial
use may provide the second use some or all of its
required bufferyard and/or extra land on which it
might develop. The existing use may reduce its
excess buffer by transferring part or all of the excess
buffer to the adjoining landowner to serve as its
buffer. Any remaining excess buffer area may be
used by the existing use for expansion of that use or
for transfer by it to the adjoining landowner to
expand that adjoining use.
28-19-22 Contractual Reduction of
Bufferyard Abutting Vacant Land. When a land
use is proposed adjacent to vacant land, and the
owner of that vacant land enters into a contractual
relationship with the owner of the land that is to be
developed first, a reduced buffer may be provided by
that first use, provided that:
(1) The contract contains a statement by the owner of
the vacant land of an intent to develop at no greater
than a specified land use intensity class; and
(2) The vacant landowner makes an agreement to
assume all responsibility for additional buffer, if
needed, by his development of a less intense use than
had been agreed upon.
28-19-23 Site Development Standards. 136
(1) The Clinton City Master Land Use Map outlines
those portions of the city intended for development
within the Performance Zone. In order to provide a
natural buffer between residential developments
adjacent to the Performance Zone and major
roadways the Performance Zone shall not be reduced
in depth from major roadways or intersections of
major roadways below the following distances:
Table 19.23.1 134
Primary Arterial 500 foot
Minor Arterial 500 Feet
Intersection, Primary and
Secondary Arterial
800 Feet
Intersection, Primary and
Collector
600 Feet
Intersection, Secondary and
Collector
500 foot
(2) Street designations shall be as established in the
Clinton City Transportation Master Plan. Distances
shall be measured perpendicular from the centerline
of the street right-of-way or as a radius from the
intersection monument where applicable. 61, 123
28-19-24 Site Design Standards. The land
use intensity classification standards (28-19-14.)
regulate landscaping (both on-site and for parking
areas), and exterior lighting. The following sections
detail the regulations which apply to each of the six
standards (R,A,B,C,D, and E) specified in Section
19.14.
28-19-25 General Landscaping
Requirements. 149
(1) This section details the general landscaping
required of particular land uses by Section 19.14.
The number and type of plant units required per three
hundred (300) linear feet of building(s) perimeter
comprising the subject land use are specified for
standards A, B, C, D and E.
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-22
(2) The landscaping requirements specified for
residential uses (R) is the requirement per ten (10)
dwelling units.
(3) The requirements of this section shall be applied
proportionately when the total linear feet of
building(s) perimeter varies from three hundred (300)
feet for nonresidential uses or ten (10) residential
dwelling units. All required planting shall be located
in areas which do not include any bufferyard or rightof-
way. Existing plant materials which meet the
requirements of this ordinance may be counted as
contributing to the total landscaping required by this
section.
(4) The following Table 19.25 specifies the type and
number of plant units required by this section.

Requirements. 123, 149 See 28-3-20 and 28-4-18 for
details.
28-19-27 Exterior Lighting Standards.
(1) Purpose: This section details the exterior
lighting standards specified in 28-19-14. The
purpose of this section is to regulate the spillover of
light and glare on operators of motor vehicles in
particular, safety considerations from the basis of the
regulations contained herein. In other cases, both the
nuisance and hazard aspects of glare are regulated.
This section is not intended to apply to public street
lighting.
(2) Definitions:
Candlepower the amount of light that will
illuminate a surface one (1) foot distant from a light
source to intensity of one (1) foot-candle. Maximum
(peak) candlepower is the largest amount of
candlepower emitted by any lamp, light source, or
luminaire.
Cutoff The points at which all light rays emitted
by a lamp, light source, or luminaire are completely
eliminated (cutoff) at a specific angle above the
ground.
Cutoff Angle the angle formed by a line drawn
from the direction of light rays at the light source and
line perpendicular to the ground from the light source,
above which no light is emitted.
Cutoff-type Luminaire a luminaire with
elements such as shields, reflectors, or refractor
panels which direct and cut off the light at a cutoff
angle that is less than ninety (90) degrees.
Foot-candle a unit of illumination produced on a
surface, all points of which are one (1) foot from a
uniform point source of one (1) candle.
Glare the brightness of a light source which
causes eye discomfort.
Luminaire a complete lighting unit consisting of a
light source and all necessary mechanical, electrical,
and decorative parts.
Maximum Permitted Illumination The
maximum illumination measured in foot-candles at
the interior bufferyard line at ground level in
accordance with the standards of Subsection (3)
below.
(3) The following standards are required of all
exterior lighting except the outdoor recreational uses
specifically exempted below. Many uses have the
option of providing a lower light post with a
noncutoff type luminaire or a higher pole, up to sixty
(60) feet, with a luminaire that totally cuts off light
spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than ninety (90)
degrees. The maximum height light post permitted is
dependent on amount of cutoff provided. This is
designed as a protection against excessive glare and
light spilling over to neighboring properties. The
exceptions which are permitted provide adequate
protection for neighboring residential property.
Exterior lighting shall meet one (1) of the following
standards:
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-23
1. When light source or luminaire has no cutoff:
Standard Maximum Permitted Illumination Maximum Permitted Height of
Luminaire
R 0.20 10 feet
A 0.20 15 feet
B, C, D, E 0.30 20 feet
An illustration of this type of luminaire is provided below.
NO CUTOFF LUMINAIRE
2. When a luminaire has total cutoff of an angle greater than ninety (90) degree, the maximum illumination
and the maximum permitted luminaire height shall be:
Standard Maximum Permitted Illumination Maximum Permitted Height of Luminaire
R 0.30 15 feet
A 0.50 20 feet
B 0.75 25 feet
C 1.0 30 feet
D 1.5 35 feet
E 2.0 40 feet
An illustration of this type of luminaire is provided below.
90° CUTOFF LUMINAIRE
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-24
3. When a luminaire has total cutoff of light at an angle less than ninety (90) degrees and is located so that
the bare light bulb, lamp, or light source is completely shielded from the direct view of an observer five
(5) feet above the ground at a point where the cutoff angle intersects the ground, then the maximum
permitted illumination and the maximum permitted height of the luminaire shall be:
Standard Maximum Permitted Illumination Maximum Permitted Height of Luminaire
R 0.50 20 feet
A 1.00 25 feet
B 2.00 30 feet
C 3.00 40 feet
D 4.00 50 feet
E 5.00 60 feet
An illustration of this type of luminaire is provided below.
LUMINAIRE WITH LESS THAN 90° CUT-OFF
4. Exemption for specified outdoor recreational uses.
1. Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility and their limited hours of operation
(specified in 28-19-14.), ball diamonds, playing fields, and tennis courts are exempted from the exterior
lighting standards of 28-19-27 (3) above. These outdoor recreational uses must meet all other
requirements of this section and of this ordinance.
2. The outdoor recreational uses specified above shall not exceed a maximum permitted post height of
eighty (80) feet.
3. The outdoor recreational uses specified above shall not exceed a total cutoff angle of ninety (90)
degrees, provided that the luminaire is shielded to prevent light and glare spillover to adjacent residential
property. The maximum permitted illumination at the interior bufferyard line shall not exceed two (2)
foot-candles.
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Performance Standard Zone Chapter 19
Page 19-25
(4) Additional Regulations: Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this section to the contrary:
(a) No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted.
(b) Light sources or luminaries shall not be located
within bufferyard areas except on pedestrian
walkways.
(5) Measurement:
(a) Metering equipment. Lighting levels shall be
measured in foot-candles with a direct-reading,
portable light meter. The meter shall have a color
and cosine-corrected sensor with multiple scales and
shall read within an accuracy of plus or minus five
(5) percent. It shall have been tested, calibrated, and
certified by an independent commercial photometric
laboratory or the manufacturer within one (1) year of
the date of its use.
(b) Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall
be mounted not more than (6) inches above ground
level in a horizontal position. Readings shall be
taken by qualified personnel only after the cell has
been exposed long enough to provide a constant
reading. Measurements shall be made after dark with
the light sources in question on, then with the same
sources off. The difference between the two readings
shall be compared to the maximum permitted
illumination at property line at ground level in
Section 19.14. This procedure eliminates the effects
of moonlight and other ambient light.
(6) Exterior Lighting Plan: At the time any exterior
lighting is installed or substantially modified, and
whenever a zoning certificate is sought, an exterior
lighting plan shall be submitted to the City in order to
determine whether the requirements of this section
have been met.
28-19-28 Sign Standards. All signs located
within this zone shall be in conformance with the
Clinton City Sign Ordinance.
28-19-29 Existing Residential Uses. 123
(1) Purpose: 126 The purpose of this section is to
permit the continued use of single family residential
development established within the Performance
Zone prior to April 12, 2004. Additionally, the intent
is not to allow any additional single-family
residences to be developed except on lots that are part
of residential plats, approved by the City and
Recorded with the Davis County Recorders Office
prior to April 12, 2004. This does not create nonconforming
uses of the existing single-family
dwellings rather it maintains all existing rights and
privileges associated with single-family dwellings.
(2) Definitions:
Subdivision Conventional. Subdivisions
designed around standard, public owned rights-ofway.
Lots are owned by the homeowner, typical
development in residential zones within the city.
Subdivision, Performance (single-family).
Developments of single-family units on privately
owned or association owned land with facilities for
recreation and open spaces as part of the subdivision.
Typically referred to as town houses and cluster
homes.

28-20-1 The Design Review Process. 149
(1) The Vision
(a) The vision of the Central Business District is to
achieve a professional and a uniform appearance
among all Clinton City downtown businesses
following the Prairie Style architecture. Uniformity
implies continuity or a complimentary look, not
cookie-cutter sameness, with variance options and
some flexibility within the adopted design standards.
The desired effect is that the downtown businesses
will have an appearance that is simple, clean and
bold.
(b) The Central Business District will be a
welcoming location. It will have characteristics that
encourage walking in and through the area, and will
not create obstacles to a pedestrian-friendly
environment. Landscaping and other streetscape
elements will be important to creating this
environment.
(2) The Central Business District Area. The area
known as the Central Business District is comprised
of areas within the Performance Standard Zone, as
identified by the Zoning Map and Ordinance, and as
shown on Map 1 on the 20-2. Its core is at the
intersection of 2000 West and 1800 North Streets,
and the area stretches north, south, east and west
along these main corridors.
(3) General Goals
(a) The Central Business District will develop in a
cohesive and visually attractive manner, with
emphasis on the use of Prairie style architecture.
(b) An architectural design review process will occur
in the planning of all new developments in the
Central Business District.
(4) Design Objectives. To achieve the vision, the City
of Clinton has identified design objectives, following
the Prairie style architecture, to guide new
construction. The standards provide specific
direction for a particular aspect of design. They are
considered important in achieving the objectives the
city has set for the Central business District.
(5) Administration
(a) The Clinton City Business District Design
Standards and Guidelines are authorized by and
relevant to the requirements of Performance
Standards Zone in the Zoning Ordinance of the City
of Clinton. A Design Review (DR) notation attached
to uses listed in the Performance Standard Zone will
require an Architectural Design Review and site plan
Evaluation by the Citys Planning Commission.
(b) In the case that a development design is not
approved, by the Planning Commission, the applicant
may do one of the following:
(i) Revise and re-submit, however, re-submittals may
incur additional processing fees. Or
(ii) Make an appeal to the City Council, to determine
if an error occurred during the Design Review
process.
(c) Amendments to the Design Standards and
Guidelines may be made following public hearings
and review held by both the Planning Commission
and the City Council.
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Central Business District Design Standards Chapter 20
Page 20-2
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Central Business District Design Standards Chapter 20
Page 20-3
(6) Design Review Procedures
(a) The design review of all projects designated in the
Zoning Ordinance with a (DR) notation shall begin
with a pre-submittal conference. The conference
shall be attended by the applicant and City staff in the
Community Development Department to review the
submittal requirements and the design review
process. Following submittal of the development
design, additional staff reviews may occur prior to
scheduling a review by the Planning Commission.
(b) The City requires that all projects within the
Central Business District be approved through the
design review process before final site plan approval
can be granted, and before a building or other
development permit is granted.
(c) The Planning Commission will perform an
Architectural Design Review  Points Evaluation to
determine adherence to the Prairie Style architecture
and character as described in the Design Standards.
Points shall be awarded for each design component
listed below according to the committees evaluation
of the project. The standards and requirements found
in zoning, subdivision and other land development
regulations are not evaluated.
(d) Points are assigned as follows:
+2
points:
If a project exceeds or meets excellently the
intent of the standard or guideline.
+1
point:
If a project meets well the intent of the
standard or guideline.
0
points:
If a project adequately meets the minimum
intent of the standard or guideline.
-1
point:
If the project does not adequately meet the
intent of the standard or guideline.
-2
points:
If the project substantially fails to follow
the intent of the standard or guideline.
(e) The following chart is used to perform the
Architectural Design Review - Points Evaluation.
All applicable characteristics are rated and points are
totaled.
(f) In addition to the above, the Planning
Commission must make findings that the
development site plan will meet the general purpose
and spirit of the Performance Standard Zone
ordinance.

28-20-2 Prairie Style Architecture.
(1) General
(a) The ideas and principles of Prairie Architecture
evolved on the drafting boards of Chicago, Illinois
beginning in the 1890s. Following the lead of Frank
Lloyd Wright, a group of architects developed over
the course of the next 25 years a style of architecture
that was unique to America.
(b) Frank Lloyd Wright believed that rooms in
Victorian era homes were boxed-in and confining. He
attempted to refine American housing by designing
houses with low horizontal lines and open interior
spaces. Prairie houses were designed to blend in with
the flat, prairie landscape.
(c) Many other architects produced Prairie homes
throughout the American Midwest. The style was
popularized by pattern books, and a subtype of the
style, the American Foursquare, became one of the
most common housing forms in the United States.
(2) Elements of Prairie Style Architecture.
(a) Elements common to the Prairie style of
architecture include:
(i) Simple, clean and bold
(ii) Horizontal lines, massing and patterns
(iii) Predominance of hipped roofs with a low roof
pitch, gabled roofs used for accents, entries etc.
(iv) Large, wide overhanging eaves
(v) Detailing  ornamentation on windows, handrails,
etc emphasizing horizontal lines
(vi) Fenestration  clustering and repetition of
windows
(vii) Use of geometric shapes
(viii) Use of square columns
(ix) Long, low walls (fencing)
(x) Contrasting color schemes
(b) Similar to Prairie style
architecture is the Craftsman
style, which was a popular
style from the early 1900s to
1930. Although the Prairie
style has been selected as the
preferred architectural style for
the Clinton City Central
Business District, use of the
Craftsman style architecture is also deemed
acceptable. Although many elements are the same
between the two styles, the following are examples of
some elements in the Craftsman style, which vary
from the Prairie style:
(i) Exposed rafters
(ii) More use of vertical patterns
(iii) More use of wood and siding
(iv) Trellises
(3) Why Was the Prairie Style Chosen for Clinton?
(a) In April of 1998, the City presented with its first
commercial development and during the development
of the project the Planning Commission and City
Council desired to create a cohesive look and
aesthetic theme within the central business district of
the City. At the direction of the Council, the
Clinton City Zoning Ordinance Title 28
Central Business District Design Standards Chapter 20
Page 20-5
Planning Commission surveyed the existing
structures within the City and surrounding area
looking for an architectural theme that could be
utilized to establish individuality within the district.
The Commission focused its attentions on the
existing Old Church, located at 1387 West on 1800
North, as a prominent architectural feature within the
City.
(b) Research determined that this structure,
constructed in 1910 was of a design that
predominately exhibited the features of Prairie
architecture, which was prominent in the eastern
portion of the U.S. at the time. The Commission,
after additional research recommended that the
Council direct staff to indicate to potential developers
the desire for this type of architecture in all future
commercial development in the central business
district. At that time the staff utilized, A Field Guide
to American Houses, by Virginia and Lee McAlester
as a reference. In the latter part of 2003, the Council
recognized that the pressure for commercial
development within the City mandated a greater
emphasis in order to maintain the architectural design
desired. It was this greater concern that dictated the
development of this document.
(4) Goal of Using the Prairie Style Architecture.
Goal: To achieve a professional and a uniform
appearance among all Clinton City downtown
businesses following the Prairie Style architecture, as
shown in the attached exhibits. Uniformity implies a
complimentary look, not cookie-cutter sameness,
with variance options and some flexibility within the
adopted design standards. The desired effect of the
downtown businesses will have an appearance that is
simple, clean and bold.

18-21-2 Interpretation of the Zoning Map
18-21-3 Appeals to Map Interpretations
28-21-1 Purpose and Intent. The Clinton City
Zoning Map is attached to this Ordinance and is
officially part of this Ordinance.
28-21-2 Interpretation of the Zoning Map.
Determinations of boundaries as established by the
Clinton City Zoning Map will be made by the
Community Development Department. These
decisions will be based upon the following guidelines.
(1) Boundaries are established based upon the legal
upon the legal description outlined in the ordinance
establishing the zone. 123
(2) Boundaries are established based upon natural
barriers, roads and features.
(3) Boundaries are established at the time of adoption
of the map based upon established property lines.
(4) Boundaries are established between property lines
at logical divisions of the sections, on section, 1/4
section, and 1/16 section lines.
(5) Performance Zone boundaries are interpreted
based upon the intended development application.
The Performance Zone boundary is intended to be
fluid in its application in that the Performance Zone of
an existing parcel may be extended into a parcel that
is not currently zoned Performance Zone. The
following are utilized in this interpretation:
(a) The property is all part of one proposed
development site plan.
(b) That the Performance Zone boundary created by
the development is contiguous.
(c) The development does not require that the
Performance Zone leapfrog over other zones.
(d) The property is recorded as one parcel at the time
the development is proposed.
(e) The property does not include residential use.
(f) The expansion of the Performance Zone does not
create any non-conforming uses within the zone.
28-21-3 Appeals to Map Interpretations. Appeals
to the decision of the Community Development
Department shall be made through the following line
of appeals and through the appropriate action
indicated.
(1) Community Development Director. Appeals may
be made in writing on a form provided by the city, if
available and shall be accompanied with the
following: 123
(a) Name address and phone number of the applicant.
(b) A copy of the city map indicating the property in
question.
(c) A fee paid as prescribed in the Clinton City
Consolidated Fee Schedule and set from time to time
and adopted by resolution of the City Council.
(2) Board of Zoning Adjustments. Appeal shall be in
accordance with Chapter 10 of this ordinance.

26-1-1 Title. In order that land may be
subdivided in accordance with the purposes and
policies herein, these subdivision regulations are
hereby adopted and made effective as of December
13, 2016. All applications for subdivision approval,
including final plats, pending on the effective date of
these regulations shall be reviewed under the
regulations existing at the time such application was
made unless the City Council determines on the
record that application of these regulations is
necessary to avoid a risk of injury to public health,
safety, and general welfare. These regulations shall
officially be known, cited, and referred to as the
Subdivision Ordinance of Clinton City.
26-1-2 Policy.
(1) Regulation of the subdivision of land and the
attachment of reasonable conditions to land
subdivision is an exercise of valid police power
delegated by the state to this City. The developer has
the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions of
this Ordinance for design, dedication, improvement,
and restrictive use of the land to conform to the
physical and economic development of the City and
to the health, safety, and general welfare of the future
lot owners in the subdivision and of the community at
large.
(2) It is declared to be the policy of the city to
consider the subdivision of land and any subsequent
development of any portion of a subdivided piece or
plat as subject to the control of the City pursuant to
the General Plan of the City for the orderly, planned,
efficient, and economical development of the City.
(3) Land to be subdivided shall be of such character
that it can be used safely for building purposes
without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or
other menace, and land shall not be subdivided unless
adequate public facilities and improvements will
exist to properly provide for drainage, water,
sewerage, and capital improvements such as parks,
recreational facilities, transportation facilities, and
improvements.
(4) The existing and proposed public improvements
shall conform to and be properly related to the master
infrastructure plans and the capital budget and
program of the City. Land that has been subdivided
prior to the effective date of these regulations should,
whenever possible, be brought within the scope of
these regulations to further the purposes of
regulation(s) identified in Section 26-1-4.
26-1-3 Public Interest. Any proposed subdivision
and its ultimate use shall be in the best interest of the
public and shall be in harmony with good
neighborhood development of the area concerned,
and the subdivider shall present evidence to this
effect when requested to do so by the Planning
Commission.
26-1-4 Purpose. These regulations are adopted for
the following purposes:
(1) To protect and provide for the public health,
safety, and general welfare of the City.
(2) To guide the future growth and development of
the City in accordance with the General Plan.
(3) To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy, to
secure safety from fire, flood, and other danger, and
to prevent overcrowding of the land and undue
congestion of population.
(4) To protect the character, the social and economic
stability of all parts of the City and to encourage the
orderly and beneficial development of the community
through appropriate growth management techniques
assuring the timing and sequencing of development,
promotion of infill development in existing
neighborhoods and nonresidential areas with
adequate public facilities, to assure proper urban
form and open space separation of urban areas, to
protect environmentally critical areas and areas
premature for urban development.
(5) To protect and conserve the value of land
throughout the City and the value of buildings and
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 1
Page 1 - 2
improvements upon the land, and to minimize the
conflicts among the uses of land and buildings.
(6) To guide public and private policy and action in
order to provide adequate and efficient transportation,
water, sewerage, parks, playgrounds, recreation, and
other public requirements and facilities.
(7) To provide the most beneficial relationship
between the uses of land and buildings and the
circulation of traffic throughout the City, having
particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in
the streets and highways and the pedestrian traffic
movements appropriate to the various uses of land
and buildings, and to provide for the proper location
and width of streets and building lines.
(8) To establish reasonable standards of design and
procedures for subdivisions and re-subdivisions in
order to further the orderly layout and use of land,
and to ensure proper legal descriptions and
establishment of survey monuments of subdivided
land.
(9) To ensure that public facilities and services are
available concurrent with development and will have
a sufficient capacity to serve the proposed
subdivision and that the community will be required
to bear no more than its fair share of the cost of
providing the facilities and services by requiring the
developer to pay fees, furnish land, or establish
mitigation measures to ensure that the development
provides its fair share of capital facilities needs
generated by the development.
(10) To prevent the pollution of air, streams, and
ponds; to assure the adequacy of drainage facilities;
to safeguard the water table, and to encourage the
wise use and management of natural resources
throughout the City in order to preserve the integrity,
stability, and beauty of the community and the value
of the land.
(11) To preserve and/or improve the natural beauty
and topography of the City and to ensure appropriate
development with regard to these natural features.
(12) To provide for open spaces through the most
efficient design and layout of the land, including the
use of average density in providing for minimum
width and area of lots, while preserving the density of
development as established in the zoning ordinance
of the City.
(13) To remedy the problems associated with
inappropriately subdivided lands.
(14) To provide for safety and security of residents,
subdivisions, commercial properties, and traffic by
planning, developing, executing and requiring a city
wide street lighting and general lighting design and
requirement.
26-1-5 Availability of Utility Services. No
development, nor permit for development, shall be
granted, approved, or issued unless the necessary
public facilities in the applicable area have been
determined to exist and have adequate capacity to
accommodate the proposed development and are
available or are to be available when the development
occurs. The applicable area includes all facilities that
directly or indirectly deliver the services to or are
impacted by the proposed development. Such a
determination is to be made by the Public Works
Department based upon the approved infrastructure
master plans.

application, the provisions of these regulations shall
be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general
welfare. These regulations shall be construed
broadly to promote the purposes for which they are
adopted.
(2) Public Provisions: These regulations are not
intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any
other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other
provision of law except as provided in these
regulations. Where any provision of these
regulations imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other provision of these regulations
or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, the provision which is more
restrictive or imposes higher standards shall control.
(3) Private Provisions: These regulations are not
intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any
other private agreement or restriction, provided that
where the provisions of these regulations are more
restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations
than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement or restriction, the requirements of these
regulations shall govern.
(4) Severability. If any part or provision of these
regulations or the application of these regulations to
any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by
any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided by
Utah law, the judgment shall be confined in its
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 1
Page 1 - 4
operation to the part, provision, or application
directly involved in the controversy in which the
judgment shall be rendered and it shall not affect or
impair the validity of the remainder of these
regulations or the application of them to other

declares that it would have enacted the remainder of
these regulations even without any such part,
provision, or application which is judged to be
invalid.
26-1-9 Savings Provision. These regulations shall
not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision
regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying,
or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or
as affecting the liability or any person, firm, or
corporation, or as waiving any right of the City under
any section or provision existing at the time or
adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or
annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm, or
corporation, by lawful action of the City except as
shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
26-1-10 Reservations and Repeals. Upon the
adoption of these regulations according to law, the

recommend a set of development guidelines and
design standards for subdivision approvals in the

shall also contain a provision that the municipality
may, without incurring any liability, engage in action
that otherwise would constitute a breach of the
covenant if the action is required by federal or state
law.
(d) Third Party Rights: Except as otherwise
expressly provided in the Development Agreement,
the Development Agreement shall create no rights
enforceable by any party who/which is not a party to

26-3-7 Signing and Recordation of Subdivision
Plat:
(1) Signing of Plat:
(a) When a subdivision improvement agreement and
security are required, the Mayor shall endorse
approval on the final plat after the agreement and
security have been approved by the Community
Development Director and City Engineer, and all the
conditions of the resolution pertaining to the final
plat have been satisfied.
(b) When installation of improvement is required
prior to recordation of the final plat, the Mayor shall
endorse approval on the final plat after all conditions
of the resolution have been satisfied and all
improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall
be written evidence that the required public facilities
have been installed in a manner satisfactory to
Clinton City as shown by a certificate signed by
Clinton City Engineer/Public Facilities Inspector and
Clinton City Attorney stating that the necessary
dedication of public lands and improvements have
been accomplished.
(2) Recordation of Plat: It shall be the responsibility
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 3
Page 3 - 6
of the Community Development Director to file the
final plat with the County Recorders Office within
ten (10) days of the date of the last signature on the
final plat. Simultaneously with the filing of the final
plat, the Community Development Director shall

subdivision is prohibited except that this prohibition
shall not apply to persons or parties who have
acquired property from the subdivider unless the
person or party acquiring property meets the
definition of common ownership in Chapter 2. If
any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates final
plat approval for any subdivision, the City shall
record a document with the Recorders Office for
Davis County declaring that the final plat for the
subdivision is no longer valid and that further
subdivision activity is prohibited.

26-4-1 Improvements and Subdivision
Improvement Agreement:
(1) Completion of Improvements: Before the final
plat of the subdivision is signed by the Mayor or
recorded with the Davis County Recorders Office,
all subdividers shall be required to either complete
and dedicate all the necessary public improvements
or establish a Subdivision Improvement Agreement
(SIA) and Cash Escrow as outlined in this Chapter.
These improvements include all street, sanitary and
other public improvements, including lot
improvements on the individual lots of the
subdivision, as required in these regulations,
specified in the final plat of the subdivision and
approved construction drawings. The subdivider is to
dedicate these public improvements to the City free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the
dedicated property and public improvements.
(2) Subdivision Improvement Agreement and
Guarantee:
(a) Agreement: If the subdivider chooses to enter
into a SIA with the City for the subdivision public
improvements, the Community Development
Director may permit the subdivider to enter into a
SIA by which the subdivider covenants to complete
all required public improvements no later than two
(2) years following the date on which the Council
approves the final plat of the subdivision.
Additionally, at the time of City Council Conditional
Approval of these public improvements, the
subdivider shall warrant, as defined in Utah Code 10-
9a-103(19), that they shall be free from defect for a
one (1) year period following the Conditional
Acceptance. The SIA shall contain such other terms
and conditions agreed to by the subdivider and the
City Council.
(b) Security: Whenever the Community
Development Director permits a subdivider to enter
into a SIA, it shall require the subdivider to provide a
cash escrow as security for the promises contained in
the SIA. The cash escrow shall be in an amount
equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the
estimated cost of completion of the required public
improvements, including lot improvements. The
estimated cost shall be reviewed and verified by the
City Engineer. The escrow agent shall be a statelicensed
institution approved to conduct business in
this capacity and must be acceptable to the
Community Development Director. The subdivider
may also have a cash escrow with the City, but
without interest amenities available with banks.
(c) Cash Escrow: When the subdivider posts a cash
escrow as security for its promises contained in the
SIA, the escrow instructions shall provide:
(i) That the subdivider will have no right to a return
of any of the funds except as provided in section 26-
4-2(2).
(ii) That should the subdivider fail or refuse to make
the improvements required as outlined in this SIA, the
City Subdivision Ordinance or approved construction
drawings within two (2) years following the date on
which the Council approves the final subdivision plat,
the City may declare the funds on deposit with the
Escrow Agent forfeited, and the escrow agent shall
have a legal duty to deliver the proceeds of the account
[see 26-4-1(6) (b)]. The funds shall be used to install
the improvements required by the City Subdivision
Ordinance and approved construction drawings. If
these escrowed funds prove to be insufficient for the
improvement construction, the City shall follow the
basic format found in subsection (d). If the additional
funding is not received by the City within the allotted
time, the City may place a lien against the subdivision
property for the unpaid amount plus administrative
fees.
(d) Escrow Deficiency: If at any time prior to
completion of the subdivision by the subdivider or
acceptance of the improvements by the City, the City
determines the amount held in escrow (exclusive of the
10% reserve) is not sufficient to complete the needed
improvements, the subdivider shall put such additional
amounts into escrow within 30 days of receiving
written notice from the City.
(e) Appeal: The subdivider may request a hearing
before the City Council for a review of the decision
of the Community Development Director, Public
Works Inspector or City Engineer or upon action by
the City to seize a cash escrow, provided said request
is made in writing and served by certified mail within
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 4
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 4 - 2
thirty (30) days after written notification of any
nonconformity with City ordinances, rules,
regulations, requirements and standards or the SIA or
Approved Construction Drawing or as to the
insufficiency of any work.
If and when the City conditionally accepts the offer
of dedication for the last completed required public
improvement, the City shall execute a waiver of its
right to receive all but ten percent (10%) of the funds
represented by the cash escrow, if the subdivider is
not in breach of the SIA. This ten percent (10%) of
the original funds shall be held as security for the
subdividers covenant to maintain the required public
improvements for the required time period and its
warranty that they are free from defect.
(3) Temporary Improvement: If temporary
improvements are required for the subdivision, the
subdivider shall build and pay for all costs of such
temporary improvements required by the Council and
shall maintain those temporary improvements for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to construction
of any temporary facility or improvement, the
developer shall file with the City a separate
Subdivision Improvement Agreement and a cash
escrow in an appropriate amount for the temporary
facilities to be properly constructed, maintained, and
removed.
(4) Required Improvements: All required
improvements shall be made by the subdivider or
developer, at their expense, without reimbursement
by the City or any improvement district except that,
as may be allowed under state law and approved by
the Council.
(5) Governmental Units: Governmental units to
which these contract and security provisions apply
may file, in lieu of the contract and security, a
certified resolution or ordinance from officers or
agencies authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to
comply with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(6) Failure to Complete Improvement:
(a) Prior to the end of the SIA two-year improvement
construction period, the City Council may grant an
extension of up to one (1) additional year for
completion of the improvements within the
subdivision. The subdivider in writing shall make
application for an extension with a copy provided to
the Escrow Agent of record, if any. Upon action by
the Council, the Community Development Director
shall notify the subdivider and Escrow Agent of any
action taken by the Council. The decision to grant
any extension period shall be within the sole
discretion of the Council.
(b) In those cases where no time extension has been
granted and a SIA escrow is in effect, the City may
then:
(i) Declare the agreement to be in default and require
that all the improvements be installed regardless of
the extent of the building development at that time;
(ii) Obtain funds under the escrow and complete
improvements itself or through a third party;
(iii) Assign its right to receive funds under the
escrow to any third party, including a subsequent
owner of the subdivision for which improvements
were not constructed, in whole or in part, after that
subsequent owner posts his own escrow for those
same uncompleted improvements; or
(iv) Exercise any other rights available under the law.
(7) Acceptance of Dedication Offers: Acceptance
of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas,
easements, and parks shall be by resolution of the
City Council as part of the subdivision final plat
approval and authorization of the Mayor to sign the
final plat. The approval of a subdivision plat by the
Planning Commission or Council, whether
preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to constitute
or imply the acceptance by the City of any required
public improvements. The Council may require the
final plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this
effect.
26-4-2 Inspection of Improvements:
(1) General Procedure and Fees: The Public
Works Inspector shall inspect required improvements
during construction and ensure their satisfactory
completion. The subdivider shall pay to the City an
inspection fee based on the estimated cost of
inspection. Where the improvements are completed
prior to approval of the final plat of the subdivision,
the subdivision plat shall not be signed by the Mayor
unless the inspection fee has been paid. These fees
shall be due and payable upon demand of the
Community Development Director and no building
permits nor certificates of occupancy shall be issued
until all fees are paid. The amount of the fees shall
be established by resolution, from time to time by the
Council and included in the Consolidated Fee
Schedule. If the Public Works Inspector finds upon
inspection that any one or more of the required
improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with the municipalitys construction
standards, specifications or approved construction
drawings, the subdivider shall be responsible for
properly completing the improvements.
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 4
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 4 - 3
(2) Release or Reduction of Security: The
Community Development Director may release funds
from an established escrow in an amount equal to that
set in the SIA for said improvements. Prior to release
of any funds the Public Works Inspector shall inspect
all improvements for which the release of funds is
being requested and verify proper material,
construction, and compliance with city standards and
approved construction drawings. For improvements
that are not to be City owned, infrastructure
inspection shall be done by and verified by an
inspector authorized by the appropriate utility. The
amount of the escrow shall be reduced upon
satisfactory inspection of the public improvements
and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public
improvement inspected bears to the total cost of
public improvements for the subdivision. In no event
shall a release be greater than the amount of the
inspected item established in the escrow nor shall the
cash escrow be reduced below ten percent (10%) of
the principal amount.
26-4-3 Acceptance of Off-Site Improvements:
(1) Conditional Acceptance of Improvements: The
City Council will not conditionally accept dedication
of required improvements, release nor reduce the
amount of any security posted by the subdivider until
the Public Works Inspector has submitted a
certificate stating that all required improvements
have been satisfactorily completed and until:
(a) The Community Development Director has
verified that all fees, charges, transfers, and deposits
related to the development have been paid to the
City;
(b) The subdividers engineer or surveyor has
certified to the Public Works Inspector, through
submission of a detailed as-built survey plat of the
subdivision, indicating location, dimensions,
materials, and other information required by the
Public Works Inspector, that the layout of the line
and grade of all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the
subdivision;
(c) A title insurance policy has been furnished to and
approved by the Community Development Director
indicating that the improvements have been
completed, are ready for dedication to the City, and
are free and clear of any and all liens and
encumbrances; and
(d) Upon such approval and recommendation by the
Public Works Inspector, the Community
Development Director shall present to the City
Council and the Council shall thereafter conditionally
accept the improvements in accordance with the
established procedure.
(2) Special Exceptions to Conditional Acceptance:
(a) The subdivider or developer shall be required to
maintain all required public improvements on the
individual subdivided lots and provide for snow
removal on streets and sidewalks until Final
Acceptance of the improvements by the City Council.
(b) If there are any certificates of occupancy on a
street not dedicated to the City, the City may, on
twelve (12) hours notice, plow the street or effect
emergency repairs and charge those costs to the
subdivider or developer.
(c) At the time of conditional acceptance the City
Council may hold back, in addition to the required
guarantee funds, the amount for seal coat, provided
that the season is not right for seal coat, and the
subdivider has indicated his willingness to participate
in the City annual seal coat contract.
(3) Final Acceptance:
(a) The subdivider shall initiate the request for final
acceptance of all improvements no earlier than one
year after conditional acceptance. Final inspection
by the Public Works Inspector shall be made upon
the request of the subdivider. All defects as noted in
the final inspection report of the Inspector shall be
corrected to the satisfaction of the Inspector. After
any defects are corrected and confirmed by the
Inspector, final acceptance of public improvements
shall be sent to the City Council for their action.
(b) Where the time required to complete the defects
and repairs indentified by the Public Works Inspector
extends past the normal one (1) year conditional
acceptance time period, the subdivider shall be
required to extend the guarantee period until such
time as the defects and repairs are confirmed
complete by the Inspector and the City Council has
formally approved final acceptance of all the public
improvements.
(4) Authority to Release: Funds held in the escrow
account after conditional acceptance shall not be
released to the subdivider, except upon express
written instructions of the City after final acceptance
by the City.
26-4-4 Deferral or Waiver of Required
Improvements:
(1) City Council Action: The Council may defer or
waive, at the time of approval of the final plat of the
subdivision, subject to appropriate conditions, the
provision of any or all public improvements as, in its
judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 4
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 4 - 4
public health, safety, and general welfare, or which
are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or nonexistence
of connecting facilities. Any determination
to defer or waive the provision of any public
improvement must be made on the record and the
reasons for the deferral or waiver also shall be
expressly made on the record.
(2) Subdividers Obligation: In the rare occasion it
is deemed necessary by the Council to defer the
construction of any improvement required under
these regulations because of incompatible grades,
future planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall
pay his share of the cost of the future improvements
to the City prior to signing of the final plat of the
subdivision by the Mayor, or the developer may
execute a separate SIA secured by a cash escrow
guaranteeing completion of the deferred
improvements upon demand of the City.
26-4-5 Escrow Deposits for Lot Improvements:
(1) Non-Developer Builders:
(a) Builders seeking a building permit in a
subdivision that they are not the guarantor for, shall
deposit with the City a cash escrow in the amount
established by resolution by the Council and
published in the Consolidated Fee Schedule. Said
cash escrow shall be paid at the time a building
permit is issued and shall insure and guarantee the lot
improvements from damage during construction.
Such improvements include but are not limited to
curb, gutter, sidewalk, water meter structures,
streetlights, grading, and other on lot improvements.
(b) Escrows deposited by non-developer builders
shall not be returned until a structure has passed final
inspection, a certificate of occupancy has been issued
and the Public Facilities/Building Inspector has
approved all lot improvements. Once authorized,
escrows shall be returned to the person paying for the
building permit by the end of the month following the
date of authorization of approval for release. No
interest shall be paid at the time of release of escrows
deposited with the City.
(2) Acceptance of Escrow Funds: Whenever, by
reason of the season of the year, any lot
improvements required by the subdivision regulations
cannot be performed, a certificate of occupancy may
be issued, provided there is no danger to health,
safety, or general welfare upon accepting a cash
escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the
Community Development Director for the cost of the
needed lot improvements. The SIA and escrow funds
covering the lot improvements shall remain in full
force and effect.
(3) Procedures on Escrow Fund: All required
improvements for which escrow monies have been
accepted by the Community Development Director at
the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy
shall be installed by the subdivider within a period of
six (6) months from the date of deposit and issuance
of the certificate of occupancy. If the improvements
have not been properly installed at the end of the time
period, the Community Development Director shall
give two (2) weeks written notice to the developer
requiring it to install the improvements, and if they
are not then installed properly, the Community
Development Director may request the Council to
proceed to contract out the work for the installation
of the necessary improvements in a sum not to
exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time
of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for
which escrow monies are being deposited with the
City, the builder shall obtain and file with the City
prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a
notarized statement from the purchaser or purchasers
of the premises authorizing the City to have the
improvements installed at the end of the six-month
period if the improvements have not been duly
installed by the subdivider.
(4) Escrow With Authorized Agent:
(a) The Community Development Director may
accept proof of an escrow, established with a state
licensed title company that guarantees any lot
improvements required by the subdivision
regulations. The escrow shall guarantee any lot
improvements not completed due to seasonal
conditions as outlined in 26-4-5(2) above. Upon
acceptance of the Title Company escrow, the
certificate of occupancy may be issued, provided
there is no danger to health, safety, or general
welfare. The amount of the escrow is to be
determined by Community Development Director for
the cost of the lot improvements being escrowed.
(b) The guarantee from the Title Company shall state
that the Title Company will have the required
improvements installed by a professional contractor
upon demand of the City.
26-4-6 Issuance of Building Permits and
Certificates of Occupancy:
(1) Escrow Funds Required: When an escrow has
not been provided for a subdivision, no building
permit or certificate of occupancy for any building in
the subdivision shall be issued prior to the
completion of the required public improvements and
the acceptance of the dedication of those
improvements by the City unless otherwise stipulated
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 4
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Page 4 - 5
in the Councils approval of the final plat of the
subdivision.
(2) Street Improvements Required: The extent of
street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular
access by the prospective occupant(s) and by police
and fire equipment prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. For the purposes of this
section, adequate generally means Hard Surfaced,
however at the discretion of the Fire Chief and
Community Development Director a temporary
certificate of occupancy may be granted under the
following conditions:
(a) The developer can show that asphalt for the
subdivision has been scheduled;
(b) All underground improvements that would cause
a street to be dug in are installed and inspected and
approved by the Public Works Inspector; and
(c) Required road base is to be installed and
compacted, and it may be reasonably assumed that
the weather will not preclude access to a structure.
Prior to the temporary certificate of occupancy being
issued the developer shall provide a letter to the City
signed by the occupants and stating that they are
aware of limitations of service and that the City will
not service the roadway until after the subdivision
improvements receive final acceptance from the City
Council.

system pressure irrigation system. There shall be no
physical connection between a public or private
potable water supply system and a secondary water
pressure irrigations system.

(g) Secondary Water: All properties and buildable
lots shall be connected to the Davis and Weber
Counties Canal Company or current managers of the
system pressure irrigation system. There shall be no
physical connection between a public or private
potable water supply system and a secondary water
pressure irrigations system.
(2) Self-Imposed Restrictions: If the owner places
restrictions on any of the land contained in the
subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions or
reference to those restrictions shall be required to be
indicated on the subdivision plat, or be recorded with
the Davis County Recorder in a form to be approved
by Clinton City Attorney.
(3) Plats Straddling Municipal Boundaries:
Whenever access to the subdivision is required across
land in another local government, the Planning
Commission may request assurance from Clinton
City Attorney that access is legally established, and
from Clinton City Engineer that the access road is
adequately improved, or that a performance bond has
been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to
assure the construction of the access road. In general,
lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross
municipal boundary lines.
(4) Monuments: The applicant shall place permanent
reference monuments in the subdivision as required
in these regulations and as approved by the City
Engineer.
(a) Monuments shall be located on street right-ofway
lines, at street intersections, angle points of
curve and block corner. They shall be spaced so as to
be within sight of each other, the sight lines being
contained wholly within the street limits.
(b) All monuments required by these regulations
shall be set flush with the ground and planted in such
a manner that they will not be removed by frost. All
monuments in the right-of-way shall be constructed
as outlined in the Engineering and standard
Specifications and Standard Drawings of Clinton
City.
(c) All monuments shall be properly set in the ground
and approved by the City Engineer or his
representative prior to the time the City Council
grants conditional acceptance of the subdivision.
(5) Character of the Land: Land that the Planning
Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easements, or other
features that will reasonably be harmful to the safety,
health, and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding
areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless
adequate methods are formulated by the developer
and approved by the Planning Commission, upon
recommendation of Clinton City Engineer, to solve
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 2
the problems created by the unsuitable land
conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as
shall not involve any danger to public health, safety,
and welfare.
(6) Soil Conditions: Buildings or structures shall not
be sited on soft or unsuitable soils, where there is a
high water table, or a site subject to flooding or on
uncompacted fill in accordance with the Engineering
and Standard Specifications and Standard Drawings
of Clinton City.
26-5-2 Lot Improvements:
(1) Lot Arrangement: The lot arrangement shall be
such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for
reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and Health
Regulations and in providing driveway access to
buildings on the lots from an approved street.
(2) Lot Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply
with the minimum standards of the Zoning
Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the
minimum required area for the zoning district, the
Planning Commission may require that those lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the
opening of future streets where they would be
necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and these regulation. In
general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a
variation from this rule will give a better street or lot
plat. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough
to allow for erection of buildings, observing the
minimum front-yard setback from both streets.
Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for
business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated, as established in the
Zoning Ordinance.
(3) Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots:
(a) Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage and
reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where
necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterial or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
(b) Access from Major and Secondary Arterials:
Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively
from a major or secondary street. Where driveway
access from a major or secondary street may be
necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning
Commission may require that such lots be served by
a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards on the street. Where possible,
driveways should be designed and arranged so as to
avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major
and secondary arterials.
(4) Debris and Waste: No cut trees, timber, debris,
earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste
materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or
left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the
final acceptance, and removal of those items and
materials shall be required prior to final acceptance
of the subdivision.
26-5-3 Fencing: Each developer shall be required
to furnish and install fences wherever the planning
commission determines that a hazardous condition or
incompatibilities in land use may exist. The fences
shall be constructed according to standards
established by the Clinton City Development
Standards and shall be noted to the height and
material on the final construction plans. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until said
fence improvements have been duly installed.
26-5-4 Staking of Lots: Survey stakes shall be
placed at both front and back lot corners to
completely identify the lot boundaries on the ground.
Back lot corners shall be marked with a metal pipe or
rod driven into the ground and shall be three feet
above the ground. Front lot corners shall be
identified with permanent plugs in the sidewalk or
back of the curb. All lot corners must be in place
prior to the issue of building permits and after
completion of all subdivision improvements. It shall
be the responsibility of the lot owner to insure that all
lot corners are in place prior to the issuance of the
building permit.
26-5-5 Roads:
(1) General Requirements:
(a) Frontage on Improved Roads: No subdivision
shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided
shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street unless such street is:
(i) An existing state road or county street; or
(ii) A street shown upon a plat approved by the City
Council and recorded in the Davis County Recorders
office. Such street must be suitably improved as
required by the Clinton City Development or be
secured by a performance bond required under these
subdivision regulations, with the width and right-ofway
required by these subdivision regulations or the
Official Map Plan.
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 3
(b) Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize
existing road frontage, the road shall be suitably
improved as provided above.
(c) Grading and Improvement Plan: Roads shall be
graded and improved and conform the Clinton City
Development Standards and shall be approved as to
design and specifications by the Clinton City
Engineer, in accordance with the construction plans
required to be submitted prior to final plat approval.
(d) Topography and Arrangement:
(e) Roads shall be related appropriately to the
topography. Local roads shall be curved wherever
possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain building sites
at or above the grades of the streets. Grades of
streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography. A combination of steep grades
and curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are
contained in the Engineering and Standard
Specifications and Standard Drawings of Clinton
City.
(i) All streets shall be properly integrated with the
existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and
dedicated rights-of-way as established on the Official
Map and/or Comprehensive Plan. Such integration
shall take topographical conditions into
consideration. The street arrangement shall not cause
unnecessary hardship to owners of adjoining property
when they plat their own land and seek to provide
convenient access to it.
(ii) All thoroughfares shall be properly related to
special traffic, generators such as industries, business
districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to
population densities; and to the pattern of existing
and proposed land uses.
(iii) Minor or local streets shall be laid out to
conform as much as possible to the topography to
discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the
minimum number of streets necessary to provide
convenient and safe access to property.
(iv) Proposed streets shall be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless
prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Planning
Commission such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most
advantageous future development of adjacent tracks.
All streets required to be extended to the boundary
lines of the subdivision shall be properly barricaded
to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
(v) In business and industrial developments, the
streets and other accessways shall be planned in
connection with the grouping of buildings, provision
of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and
walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic,
including pedestrian.
(f) Blocks:
(i) Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide two
tiers of lost of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this
prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks
adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways.
(ii) The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be
such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of
development contemplated, but block lengths in
residential areas shall no exceed one thousand three
hundred twenty (1,320) feet or twelve (12) times the
minimum lot width required in the zoning district,
nor be less than four hundred (400) feet in length.
Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials
and collector streets shall be not less than one
thousand (660) feet in length.
(iii) In long blocks the Planning Commission may
require the reservation of an easement through the
block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or
pedestrian traffic.
Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten (10)
feet wide, may be required by the Planning
Commission through the center of blocks more than
eight hundred (800) feet long where deemed essential
to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or
other community facilities. Blocks designed for
industrial uses shall be of such length and width as
may be determined suitable by the Planning
Commission for prospective use.
(g) Access to Primary and Secondary Arterials:
Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed primary arterial, the Planning
Commission may require that access to such streets
be limited by one of the following means:
(i) The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the
primary arterial and front onto a parallel local street;
no access shall be provided from the primary arterial,
and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
(ii) A marginal access or service road (separated from
the primary arterial by a planting or grass strip and
having access at suitable points.)
(h) Road Regulatory Signs: The applicant shall
install all traffic signs per Manual of Uniform Traffic
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 4
Control Devices (MUTCD) and before issuance of
certificates of occupancy for any residence within the
subdivision. Street number signs are to be placed at
all intersections within or abutting the subdivision,
the type and location of which to be approved by the
Community Development Department. Speed limit
signs are to be placed at the entrance to all
subdivisions from arterial, minor arterial, and
collector streets. Traffic regulatory signs,
information signs and safety signs shall be placed as
required by the Community Development
Department.
(i) Construction of Roads: The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of principal
streets between adjacent properties when the
continuation is necessary for convenient movement
of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities, and where the continuation is in
accordance with Clinton City Transportation Master
Plan. A development with homes numbering greater
than 30 must have a second roadway access. If the
adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
temporarily be a dead-end street, the right-of-way
including all city utilities shall be extended to the
property line. A temporary turnabout shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end streets, greater
than one lot in depth with the notation on the
subdivision plat that land outside the normal street
right-of-way shall revert to abuttors whenever the
street is continued. The Planning Commission may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in
accordance with the design standards of these
regulations.
(2) Design Standards:
(a) General: In order to provide for roads of suitable
location, width, and improvement to accommodate
prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to
police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and
road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads
so as to compose a convenient system and avoid
undue hardships to adjoining properties, the
following design standards for roads are hereby
required. Road classification may be indicated in the
Comprehensive Plan, Transportation Master Plan or
Official Map; otherwise, it shall be determined by the
Planning Commission.

(b) Road Surfacing and Improvements: After sewer,
water, secondary water, storm drain, land drain and
utilities with associated conduits have been installed
by the developer or appropriate utility company, the
developer shall construct curbs and gutters and shall
surface or cause to be surfaced road-ways to the
widths prescribed in these regulations. All surfacing
shall be of a character established in the Engineering
and Standard Specifications and Standard Drawings
of Clinton City. Types of pavement shall be as
outlined in the Engineering and Standard
Specifications and Standard Drawings of Clinton
City or as established by a soils engineer after a
complete soils analysis and with the concurrence of
the City Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made
for culverts, drains, and bridges. All road pavement,
shoulders, drainage improvements and structures,
curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to
the Engineering and Standard Specifications and
Standard Drawings of Clinton City and shall be
incorporated into the construction plans required to
be submitted by the developer for plat approval. The
developer is responsible to have a maintenance coat
applied to the surface of all new pavement as outlined
in the Engineering and Standard Specifications and
Standard Drawings of Clinton City.
(c) Railroads and Limited Access Highways:
Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways
where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows.
(i) In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet
in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot
required in the district shall be provided adjacent to a
limited access highway. This buffer strip shall be the
full width of the lot and shall not be counted as part
of the lot when averaging is figured as allowed in the
Zoning Ordinance. This strip shall be part of the
platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: This
strip is reserved for screening. The placement of
structure on this land is prohibited
(ii) In districts zoned for business, commercial or
industrial uses the nearest street extending parallel or
approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever
practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to
ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial
sites.
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 5
(iii) Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting
a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to
the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150
from the railroad right-of-way.
(d) Intersections:
(i) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection
of two (2) new streets at an angle of less than
seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An
oblique street should be curved approaching an
intersection and should be approximately at right
angles for at least one hundred (100) feet there from.
Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any
one point unless specifically approved by the
Planning Commission.
(ii) Proposed new intersections along one side of an
existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide
with any existing intersections on the opposite side of
such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less
than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the
intersected street has separated dual drives without
median breaks at either intersection. Where streets
intersect major streets, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersection of major streets shall be at
least eight hundred (800) feet apart.
(iii) Where any street intersection will involve earth
banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that
would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility,
the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of
the public right-of-way to the extent deemed
necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
(3) Road Dedications and Reservations:
(a) New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new
subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or
avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing
half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other
half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by
the developer.
(b) The City Council, upon recommendation by the
Planning Commission, may authorize a new
perimeter street where the subdivider improves and
dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width
within its own subdivision boundaries. At the
discretion of the City Council, after recommendation
of the Planning Commission, and in accordance with
all City ordinances, the developer may retain a
protection strip of not less than one foot in width
between the street and adjacent property. An
agreement with the City, approved by the City
Attorney, Shall be made by the developer,
contracting to dedicate the one foot or larger
protection strip free of charge to the City for street
purposes upon payment by the present owners of the
contiguous property to the developer of a
consideration named in the agreement. Such
consideration is to be equal to the cost, at the time of
the agreement, of the street improvements, including
utility lines properly chargeable to the contiguous
property, plus the value of the land from the right-ofway
line to the centerline of the street at the time of
the agreement, together with interest at a fair rate
from the time of agreement until the time of
subdivision of such contiguous property. All charges
to be associated with the protection strip, as well as
the interest rate, shall be recorded as part of the
aforementioned agreement. All property owned by
the developer shall be included on both the
preliminary and final plat.
(i) Where the developer is required to improve the
full width of an existing City owned right-of-way on
the perimeter of his subdivisions, the City Council
may enter into a similar agreement as outlined in (i)
above. In this agreement, the developer will not own
a one-foot protection strip and the consideration
named in this agreement will not include the value of
the land or and utilities installed in the right-of-way
prior to the agreement. However, the agreement will
stipulate that before approval is given to development
on the adjacent property abutting the street, the
adjacent property owners will reimburse the
aforementioned developer as outlined in the
agreement.
(c) Widening and Realignment of Existing Roads:
Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road
or when the Master Plan, Official Map, or zoning
setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or
widening a road that would require use of some of
the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be
required to improve and dedicate at its expense those
areas for widening or realignment of those roads.
Frontage roads and streets as described above shall
be improved and dedicated by the applicant at its own
expense to the full width as required by these
subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any road
purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or
area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance whether
the land is to be dedicated to the municipality in fee
simple or an easement granted to the City.
26-5-6 Drainage and Storm Sewers:
(1) General Requirements: The Planning
Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of subdivision that does not make adequate
provision for storm and flood water runoff channels
or basins. The City Engineer shall make the
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 6
determination of adequate provision. The storm
water drainage system shall be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm
drainage point of discharge from channel or conduit
shall be protected from erosion by suitable structure
or lining. Storm sewers, where required, shall be
designed by a method approved by the City Engineer,
and a copy of design computations shall be submitted
along with the construction plans. All locations and
sizes of storm sewer lines shall be in conformance
with the Clinton City Storm Sewer Master Plan.
(2) Nature of Storm Water Facilities:
(a) Location: The applicant may be required by the
Planning Commission to carry away by pipe or open
ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previously to, or as a result of the subdivisions. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road rightof-
way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed
easements of appropriate width, and shall be
constructed in accordance with the construction
standards and specifications.
(b) Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers: Where a
public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are
within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall
be made for the disposal of storm waters, subject to
the specifications of Clinton City Engineer.
However, in business and industrial districts,
underground storm sewer systems shall be
constructed throughout the subdivisions and be
conducted to an approved out-fall. Inspection of
facilities shall be scheduled with and conducted by
the City Engineer and/or Public Works Director.
(c) Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas: A
storm sewer line or other drainage facility shall in
each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. Clinton
City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of
the facility, based on the provisions of the Clinton
City Development standards and the Storm Sewer
Master Plan assuming conditions of maximum
potential watershed development permitted by the
Clinton City Comprehensive Plan.
(d) Effect on Downstream Drainage Area: Clinton
City Engineer shall also study the effect of each
subdivision on existing downstream drainage
facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Local
government drainage studies together with such other
studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide
to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that
the additional runoff incident to the development of
the subdivision will overload an existing downstream
drainage facility, the Planning Commission may
withhold approval of the subdivision until provision
has been made for the expansion of the existing
downstream drainage facility. No subdivision shall
be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or
facility.
(f) Detention Basins: Large multiple use detention
basins serving multiple neighborhoods will be
located in Clinton City as designated on the Clinton
City Storm Sewer Master Plan Map. Single lot
detention basins located in individual subdivisions
shall not be encouraged. Should on-site water
detention be desired or necessary for the feasibility of
the subdivision, the detention basin must:
Serve as a multiple use area such as an open area for
park activities.
Be adequately landscaped with grass and shrubs.
Such landscaping shall also include a means to keep
it irrigated
Be designed to hold water only during a storm and
shortly thereafter. At all other times, it must remain
dry
Temporary detention basins may be authorized by the
City Council in which the above requirements may
be relaxed. Under no circumstances shall a
temporary detention basin be utilized for more than
two years.
Floodplain Area: The Planning Commission may,
when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the
area and necessary to the conservation of water,
drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property that lies
within the floodplain of any stream or drainage
course. These floodplain areas shall be preserved
from any and all destruction or damage resulting
from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste
material, or stumps, except at the discretion of the
Planning Commission.
(3) Dedication of Drainage Easements:
(a) General Requirements: When a subdivision is
traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or
stream, there shall be provided a storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction as will be adequate for
the purpose. Drainage Easements:
(i) Where topography or other conditions are such as
to make impractical the inclusion of drainage
facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual,
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 7
unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in
width for drainage facilities shall be provided across
property outside the road lines and with satisfactory
access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on
the plat. Drainage easement shall extend from the
road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage
facilities.
(ii) When a proposed drainage system will carry
water across private land outside the subdivision,
appropriate drainage rights must be secured, assigned
to the City and indicated on the plat or recorded with
other appropriate instrument as approved by the
Clinton City Attorney.
(iii) The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by a
drainage or conservation easement, land on both
sides of existing watercourses to a distance to be
determined by the Planning Commission.
(iv) Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to
flooding or over flowing during storm periods,
whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall
be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainage ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic
flooding shall not be computed in determining the
number of lots to be utilized for average density
procedures nor for computing the area requirement of
any lot.
26-5-7 Subsurface Drainage
26-5-8 Water Facilities:
(1) General Requirements:
(a) Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant
to provide water for the purposes of providing a
water-supply system capable of providing domestic
water use and fire protection.
(b) When a public water main is accessible, the
developer shall install adequate water facilities
(including fire hydrants) subject to the specifications
of state or local authorities. All water mains shall be
at least six (6) inches in diameter. All water lines
must be extended across the entire frontage of all
existing streets and to the boundary of the
subdivision on all existing or proposed streets.
Sectionalizing valves shall be provided at point of
connection to existing water distribution system and
at every 800 feet of water main for line maintenance
and repair. All legs and intersections shall also have
valves.
(c) Water main extensions shall be approved by the
Clinton City Public Works Department.
(d) To facilitate the above, the proposed location of
all fire hydrants, all waterlines with size indicated,
and water valves shall be shown on the preliminary
plat, and the cost of installing same shall be included
in the performance bond to be furnished by the
developer.
(e) A development with water connections
numbering greater than 30 must have two main line
connections interconnected from separated feeds.
Developments with multiple phases may have up to
30 connections with a single feed prior to the second
connection being installed with the approval of staff.
(f) Developments overlapping water system pressure
zones must be designed and installed such that they
are consistent with the Citys Water Master Plan and
to maintain the functionality of the pressure zones.
(2) Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants shall be required for
all subdivisions. Fire hydrants shall be located no
more than 500 feet apart and within 250 feet of any
structure and shall be approved by the Clinton City
Fire Department. To eliminate future street openings,
all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together
with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply
improvements shall be installed before any final
paving of a street shown on the subdivision plat.
26-5-9 Secondary Water System. The applicant is
not required to provide secondary water as a
condition of approval. However, Clinton City will
allow a developer to establish a secondary water
system within his subdivision provided the design of
the system meets the approval of the City Engineer.
26-5-10 Sewerage Facilities:
(1) General Requirements:
(a) The applicant shall install sanitary sewer facilities
in a manner prescribed by the Clinton City
Development Standards. Sanitary sewerage facilities
shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems.
Sewers shall be installed to serve each lot and to
grades and sizes required by the Clinton City
Development Standards. No individual disposal
system or treatment plants (private or group disposal
systems) shall be permitted.
(2) Design Criteria for Sanitary Sewers:
(a) General Guidelines: These design criteria are not
intended to cover extraordinary situations.
Deviations will be allowed and may be required in
those instances when considered justified by City
Engineer.
(b) Design Factors: Sanitary sewer systems should
be designed for the ultimate tributary population.
Due consideration should be given to the Citys
Clinton City Code of Ordinances Title 26
Subdivisions Chapter 5
Page 5 - 8
Comprehensive Plan and Sewer Master Plan. Sewer
capacities should be adequate to handle the
anticipated maximum hourly quantity of sewage and
industrial waste together with an adequate allowance
for infiltration and other extraneous flow. The unit
design flows presented below should be adequate in
each case for the particular type of development
indicated. Sewers shall be designed for the total
tributary area using the following criteria:
(c) Table 1:
One and Two-Family Dwellings .02 c.f.s./acre
Apartments
One and Two Story .02 c.f.s./acre
Three through Six Story .03 c.f.s./acre
Commercial
Small Stores and Miscellaneous
Business .02 c.f.s./acre
Shopping Centers .02 c.f.s./acre
High Rise As directed by City Engineer
Industrial As directed by City Engineer
(d) These design factors shall apply to watersheds of
300 acres or less. Design factors for watersheds
larger than 300 acres and smaller than 1,000 acres
shall be computed on the basis of a linear decrease
from the applicable design factor for and area of 300
acres to a design factor of .01 c.f.s/acre for and area
of 1,000 acres unless otherwise directed by the City
Engineer. Design factors for watersheds larger than
1,000 shall be .01 c.f.s./acre unless otherwise directed
by the city Engineer.
(e) Maximum Size: The diameter of sewers
proposed shall not exceed the diameter of the existing
or proposed outlet, whichever is applicable, unless
otherwise approved by Clinton City Engineer.
(f) Minimum Size: No public sewer shall be less
than eight (8) inches in diameter.
(g) Minimum Slope: All sewers shall be designed to
give mean velocities when flowing full of not less
than 2.7 feet per second. All velocity and flow
calculations shall be based on the Manning Formula
using an N value of 0.013. The design slopes shall be
evenly divisible by four (4). The slopes shall be a
minimum for the size indicated. Exceptions to these
minimum slopes shall be made at the upper end of
lateral sewers serving under thirty (30) houses. Said
sewers shall have a minimum slope of 0.76 percent.
When lateral sewers serve less than ten (10) houses,
the minimum slope shall be not less than one (1)
percent. (See table 2)
(h) Table 2:
Sewer Size (in inches) Minimum Slope in Feet
per 100 feet

(i) Alignment: All sewers shall be laid with straight
alignment between manholes, unless otherwise
directed or approved by Clinton City Engineer.
(j) Manhole Location: Manholes shall be installed at
the end of each line; at all changes in grade, size, or
alignment; at all intersections; and at distances not
greater than 400 feet for sewers 15 inches and
smaller, and 500 feet for sewers 18 inches in
diameter and larger.
(k) Manholes: The difference in elevation between
any incoming sewer and the manhole invert shall not
exceed 12 inches except where required to match
crowns. The use of drop manholes will require
approval by Clinton City Engineer. The minimum
inside diameter of the manholes shall conform to
those specified by Clinton City Engineer. Inside drop
manholes will require special considerations;
however, in no case shall the minimum clear distance
be less than that indicated above. When a smaller
sewer joins a larger one, the crown of the smaller
sewer shall not be lower than that of the larger one.
The minimum drop through manholes shall be 0.2
feet.
(l) Sewerage Locations: Sanitary sewers shall be
located within street or alley rights-of-way unless
topography dictates otherwise. When located in
easements on private property, access shall be to all
manholes. A manhole shall be provided at each
street or alley crossing. End lines shall be extended
to provide access from street or alley right-of-ways
when possible. Imposed loading shall be considered
in all locations. Not less than six (6) feet of cover
shall be provided over the top of pipe in street an

applicant utilizes planned unit development or
density zoning in which land is set aside by the
developer as required by the provision of the Zoning
Ordinance, whenever a tract to be subdivided
includes a school, recreation use or other public use
as indicated on the Master Plan or any portion
thereof, the space shall be suitably incorporated by
the applicant into his sketch plat. After proper
determination of its necessity by the Planning
Commission and the appropriate local government
official or other public agency involved in the
acquisition and use of each such site and a
determination has been made to acquire the site by
the public agency, the site shall be suitably
incorporated by the applicant into the preliminary and
final plats.

intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall
be accompanied by a sketch plat of the proposed
development and a tentative schedule of construction.
Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate
acquisition within the prescribed 12 months shall
result in the removal of the reserved designation
from the property involved and the freeing of the
property for development in accordance with these
regulations.
26-5-10 Irrigation Water. No irrigation ditches
shall be permitted within the boundary of a
subdivision or minor subdivision. All necessary

of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from
any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land
effected until approval of the preliminary plat has
been granted.
26-5-12 Nonresidential Subdivisions:
(1) General: If a proposed subdivision includes land
that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes,
the layout of the subdivision with respect to the land
shall make provision as the Planning Commission
may require. A nonresidential subdivision shall also
be subject to all the requirements of site plan
approval set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Site plan
approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval
may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the
Planning Commission. A nonresidential subdivision
shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards
required by the Planning Commission, and shall
conform to the proposed land use and standards
established in the Master Plan, Official Map, and
Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Standard: In addition to the principles and
standards in these regulations, which are appropriate
to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission
that the street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is
specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes
