b.    The public safety/legal committee meetings shall be attended by the police chief, the prosecuting attorney/risk manager, and a representative of the municipal court. The city attorney shall attend those meetings at which legal issues are discussed via telephone call.

4.    The community services committee, which shall consider matters related to the library, parks and recreation, community events, and other community services.

Strategic planning will deal with very long-term policy planning, including capital improvement planning as part of the city’s comprehensive plan. Finance/budget will deal with short-term planning which falls under the budget process (including capital improvement projects), with capital improvement projects being reviewed by individual committees, then being reviewed by the finance/administration committee, and then being forwarded with recommendations to the full city council.

C.    The committees shall be advisory only and shall have no power to take final action on behalf of the city council unless specifically authorized to do so by the city council. Committees may take public comment during any committee meeting on any matter within the committee’s purview. It is the intent that the committees provide for such comment in an informal atmosphere which allows for a dialogue between the public and the committee members. To that end, the committees are encouraged to adopt informal seating arrangements and procedures which promote interaction while providing for the orderly conduct of the committee’s business.

D.    Each committee shall consist of three members of the city council appointed as follows:

1.    The city council will hold a workshop meeting in early January of each even-numbered year in order to review councilmembers’ requests for committee assignments, to determine who will serve on each committee, and to appoint the deputy mayor and alternate deputy mayor. All councilmembers will submit their prioritized requests for committee assignments in writing to the city clerk prior to the meeting. The mayor shall chair the meeting, but assignments and appointments shall be decided by the city council.

2.    In order to ensure continuity on committees, at least one councilmember from the previous term shall remain on the committee.

3.    Committee members, deputy mayor, and alternate deputy mayor shall serve for two years or until a successor is appointed. Newly elected or appointed councilmembers will serve in their predecessor’s committee assignment until the new committee assignments are established.

B.    Any person so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may, within ten days from the date of his removal, suspension, demotion or discharge, file with the commission a written demand for an investigation, whereupon the commission shall conduct such investigation. The investigation shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether such removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was or was not made for political or religious reasons, and was or was not made in good faith for cause.

C.    After such investigation, the commission may affirm the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge or if it finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was made for political or religious reasons, or was not made in good faith for cause, shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of such person in the office, place, position or employment from which such person was removed, suspended, demoted or discharged; which reinstatement shall, if the commission so provides in its discretion, be retroactive, and entitle such person to pay or compensation from the time of such removal, suspension, demotion or discharge. The commission, upon such investigation in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge, may order that such action that it deems appropriate be taken in lieu of removal, suspension, demotion or discharge. The findings of the commission shall be certified in writing to the appointing power, and shall be enforced by such officer.

The commission shall, within ten days after the filing of such notice, make, certify and file such transcript with such court. The court of original and unlimited jurisdiction in civil suits shall proceed to hear and determine such appeal in a summary manner; provided, however, that such hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the judgment or order made by the commission was or was not made in good faith for cause, and no appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds. (Ord. 84-49 § 8, 1984)


2.84.100 Vacancy-filling—Eligibility lists—Probationary period.

The commission shall then certify the names of the three persons standing highest on the list. If more than one vacancy is to be filled, an additional name shall be certified for each additional vacancy. The commission may in its discretion adopt rules to provide for situations in which there are less than three names available for appointment to the eligibility list or fewer candidates than are required to provide the number of names specified by those rules; provided, however, that such rules shall preserve the right of the appointing authority to exercise its right as provided in subsection D of this section to either appoint from the list or elect to fill the vacancy by temporary appointment until such time as the eligibility list contains the name of at least three available eligibles or the minimum number required under these rules.

C.    Whenever requisition is to be made, or whenever a position is held by a temporary appointee and an eligible list for the class of such position containing the names of at least three eligibles exists, the commission shall certify the names of the top three persons eligible for appointment to the appointing power, and the appointing power shall appoint one person so certified, provided they are found to in fact be qualified, to the position.

D.    If there is an eligible list for the class which contains the names of less than three eligibles, the appointing authority may, upon being notified of such fact, elect to fill the vacancy by temporary appointment until the eligible list contains the names of at least three eligibles. The civil service commission may provide in its rules for expiration of an eligible list when the number of names on such list has been reduced to less than three, or may provide for a method of supplementing the list with additional eligibles who have been tested in the same manner as those on the list.

E.    To enable the appointing authority to exercise a choice in the filling of positions, no appointment, employment or promotion in any position in the classified service shall be deemed complete until after the expiration of a period of one year probationary service, as shall be provided in the rules of the civil service commission during which the appointing power may terminate the employment of the person certified to him/her. If during the performance test thus afforded, upon observation or consideration of the performance of duty, the appointing authority deems him/her unfit or unsatisfactory for service in the department, the appointing authority shall designate one of the persons certified as standing within the next three persons highest on any such list. Such persons shall likewise enter upon the duties until some person is found who is deemed fit for appointment, employment or promotion for the probationary period provided therefor, whereupon the appointment, employment or promotion shall be deemed to be complete.

F.    The commission shall provide a procedure in its rules for extending probations for up to an additional six months if requested by the appointing authority, and when such extension is determined to be warranted in the discretion of the commission. (Ord. 93-11 § 1, 1993; Ord. 84-49 § 9, 1984)

The city clerk is hereby designated as the city’s public records officer. Contact information for the city clerk shall be made available in a manner reasonably calculated to provide the public with notice of this information, such as posting at Poulsbo City Hall or on the city’s internet site. (Ord. 2017-19 § 2, 2017)


2.98.020 Indices of records.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070, the city council of the city of Poulsbo has declared that the indexing and maintenance of an index of all public records obtained by the city would be unduly burdensome and would interfere with the operations of the city. A current index as described in RCW 42.56.070 will therefore not be maintained by the city. The city clerk shall continue to make available for public inspection and copying all existing indices maintained for use by the city of Poulsbo. (Ord. 2017-19 § 2, 2017)


2.98.030 Exemptions.

The city hereby adopts by reference those exemptions from public inspection and copying described in Chapter 42.56 RCW, as the same may be amended from time to time. In addition, the city adopts as its current list containing every law, other than those listed in the Public Records Act, that it believes exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records required under RCW 42.56.070(2), those exemptions set forth in Appendix C of “Public Records Act for Washington Cities, Counties, and Special Purpose Districts” by the Municipal Research and Services Center in September 2016, as may be amended from time to time. The office of the city clerk shall maintain a copy of this list. This section shall not limit the city’s ability to deny a request or refuse disclosure under any other statute or source of law. (Ord. 2017-19 § 2, 2017)


2.98.040 Procedure for inspection and copying.

A. Persons wishing to inspect or copy city public records shall file a request in person, by phone or by mail (U.S., special delivery, or electronic), or via the public records web portal to the public records officer. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.520, the city shall respond to the request for public records within five business days of receipt and shall either (1) provide the record, (2) provide an internet address and link on the city’s website to the specific records requested, except that if the requestor notifies the city that he or she cannot access the records through the internet, then the city must provide copies of the record or allow the requestor to view copies using a city computer, (3) acknowledge receipt of the request and provide a reasonable estimate of the time the city will require to respond to the request, (4) if the request is unclear, acknowledge the request and ask the requestor to clarify the request and provide, to the greatest extent possible, a reasonable estimate of the time the city will require to respond to the request if it is not clarified, or (5) deny the request. Additional time to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the intent of the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt. If the requestor fails to clarify a request when asked, the city must respond to the parts of the request that are clear. If the entire request is unclear and the requestor fails to respond to a request for clarification, the city need not respond to it.

B. Public records may be provided on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of requested records are assembled or made ready for public disclosure. If an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.

C. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070 and 42.56.120, the city may impose a reasonable charge for providing copies and for the use of city equipment, which charges shall not exceed the amount necessary to reimburse the city for its actual costs incident to such copying. The city clerk may establish a cost schedule for such charges under PMC 3.12.040(C). The city finds that it would be unduly burdensome to calculate the cost of producing standard black and white paper copies of records; scanning paper records into an electronic format; attaching files for electronic delivery; and transmitting data electronically because such calculation would require the city to parse numerous cost factors (including staff time, depreciation value of copying equipment, ink, paper, electricity, and data storage and transmission services). Though each of these factors imposes a cost on the city, the individual contribution of each copy to the total costs is so small that attempting to calculate the exact cost of each service may lead to error. The city therefore authorizes the city clerk to impose the default costs for these services in RCW 42.56.120(2)(b). For all other costs associated with producing copies of public records, the city clerk shall establish the actual costs of the service. The city may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request. If public records are made available on a partial or installment basis, the applicable fees shall be due and payable for each part of the request as it is provided.

D. No fee shall be charged for the inspection of public records. Copies of records can be reviewed at City Hall.

E. The city shall not distinguish among persons requesting records, and such persons shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose of the request, except to establish whether inspection or copying would violate the prohibition on providing a list of individuals for commercial purposes or any other statute or ordinance which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records based on the purpose of the request or the intended use of records. (Ord. 2017-19 § 2, 2017)


2.98.050 Denials—Procedure for review of decision.

A. If the city clerk determines that a document is exempt in part but can be made available after deletion of exempt portions, the request shall be granted; provided, that such exempt portions shall first be deleted. If the city clerk determines to deny the request, in whole or in part, a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial shall be provided to the requestor.

B. Any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing (including email) to the city clerk for a review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the public records officer or designee denying the request. The city clerk shall promptly provide the petition and any other relevant information to the risk manager. The risk manager will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the city’s receipt of the petition, or within such other time as the city and the petitioner mutually agree to. Any person may obtain review of denials of public records requests pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 from the Kitsap County superior court at the conclusion of two business days after the initial denial, regardless of any internal administrative appeal.

Chapter 3.68 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY

Sections:

3.68.010    Purpose.

3.68.020    Procedures.


3.68.010 Purpose.

This chapter establishes procedures for disposition of property, other than real estate, which is surplus to the needs of the city. It is the intention of the city council that the procedures set forth in this chapter are preferred over others; therefore, special procedures called for under other legislation are to be deemed exceptions to this chapter and their use is to be limited accordingly. (Ord. 94-08 § 1, 1994)


3.68.020 Procedures.

The procedures for the identification and proper disposal of surplus property as established by this chapter are as follows:

A.    Responsibility for Administration. The city’s finance department is responsible for the administration of this chapter. The finance director shall arrange for the disposition of surplus property and shall assist the council in determining the best method of disposal. All departments of the city shall cooperate with the finance director to ensure the most efficient and beneficial disposition of surplus property.

B.    Surplus Property Schedule. A list of surplus property shall be generated semi-annually by the finance director. The finance director shall periodically check with all department heads to determine when there are sufficient items to publish a surplus property list. When requested to do so by the finance director, departments wishing to dispose of surplus property shall submit a listing of all property surplus to their department with sufficient information to properly describe the items. The listing shall contain a detailed description of the property, its location and condition.

C.    Determination of Value. When requested by the coordinator to submit a listing of the surplus property, the department shall make an estimate of the reasonable market value in “as-is, where-is” condition, to be submitted to the finance director with the surplus property listing. If the department responsible for the property cannot make the estimate, the finance director shall determine the reasonable market value.

D.    Determination of City Use. Before completing the property listing, the finance director shall determine whether any other department of the city has a use for the property. If such a use is found, the finance director shall transfer ownership and shall ensure that, if appropriate, the fund disposing of the property is reimbursed for its reasonable market value.

E.    Report to City Council. The finance director shall compile a listing of all surplus property of the city and submit for city council review at a regular meeting.

F.    Council Action. Disposition of surplus property must be approved by a majority of the city council. The procedure is as follows:

1.    The council shall examine the report of the finance director at a public meeting and may, by majority vote, declare property as surplus to the needs of the city and available for disposition.

2.    The council shall direct the finance director to carry out their directions for disposal of the surplus property with the assistance of the department owning the property.

3.    In certain situations a public hearing may be required before city council action or the city council may hold one at their discretion. Transfers of property in excess of five thousand dollars to another governmental agency or below market value is an example of a situation in which a public hearing is required by state law.

G.    Guidelines for Decision of the Council. The council shall direct the finance director to dispose of surplus property in the manner deemed to be in the best interest of the city. Considerations for such disposition shall include, but are not limited to:

1.    Possible future requirements of the city;

2.    Present value of the property;

3.    Likelihood of locating a buyer;

4.    Intergovernmental cooperation;

5.    The general welfare of the citizens of the city.

H.    Methods of Disposition. If the surplus property is not required by any department of the city, the finance director may utilize one of the following methods of disposition:

1.    Public auction;

2.    Solicitation of written bids;

3.    Negotiated sale to one or more designated buyers;

4.    Transfer to another agency of government at or below reasonable market value;

5.    Donation to a charitable or nonprofit organization.

If after attempting to dispose of the property under one or more of the preceding methods, if the finance director in his or her discretion determines that due to damage, deterioration or obsolescence the property no longer has a market value or such market value is exceeded by the cost of repair, the finance director may authorize disposition of the property through nontraditional methods of sale including a city-wide garage sale. If the continued cost of storage or the need of the city for existing space makes the continued storage of valueless items impracticable, the finance director is authorized to direct the salvaging of any recyclable material and the disposition of the remainder as refuse through appropriate methods of waste disposal. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to authorize the gifting of any item of value to a city employee or other private person.

I.    Statutory Exceptions. Certain city ordinances and provisions of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) impose special conditions for the disposition of municipal property. Where necessary, city officials shall comply with those laws, treating them as limited exceptions to this chapter. Exceptions include, but are not limited to, the following as they may from time to time be amended:

1.    RCW 43.46.095—Disposition of works of art;

2.    RCW 27.12.305, 27.12.320—Disposition of library materials;

3.    RCW 35.21.088—Equipment rental;

4.    RCW 35.21.660, 35.21.725 through 35.21.755—Transfer to municipally chartered corporations;

5.    RCW 35.21.820—Ride-sharing vehicles;

6.    Chapter 35.94 RCW—Surplus utility property;

7.    Chapters 39.33 and 39.34 RCW—Intergovernmental agreements; alternate method for intergovernmental disposition of property;

8.    RCW 46.52.145; Poulsbo Municipal Code 10.18.030—Disposition of abandoned junk motor vehicles;

9.    Chapter 63.21 RCW—Disposition of found or forfeited property;

10.    RCW 9.41.098; Poulsbo Municipal Code 9.01.010—Disposition of firearms. (Ord. 95-16 § 1, 1995; Ord. 94-08 § 2, 1994)

A taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall report monthly, quarterly or immediately following the conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions, or closing of business in accordance with a formula determined by the director. The director shall notify the taxpayer of such determination.

The director may, for good cause shown, extend the time for making and filing any return for such reasonable additional time periods as he/she deems appropriate under the circumstances. This extension does not affect the imposition of penalties pursuant to Section 3.76.130.

B.    When Due and Payable. Except as outlined below, any tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, and/or any reports and returns required to be filed by the taxpayer shall be due and payable on or before the last day of the month next succeeding the end of the reporting period covered by the return.

Any taxpayer who is exempt from the tax pursuant to Section 3.76.050B and C, for the tax year, shall be exempt from the tax filing requirements established in Section 3.76.110.

A penalty of twenty-five percent of the tax due shall be added if it is determined that a taxpayer did not fall under the exemption thresholds set forth in Section 3.76.050 and failed to file pursuant to this section. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.090 Mailing of notices.

Any notice or order required by this chapter or required by the Poulsbo Municipal Code to be mailed to any taxpayer, may be sent by ordinary mail, special delivery, personal delivery mail or other similar delivery mail, at the discretion of the director, to the address of the taxpayer as shown by the records of the department. If no such address is shown by the records, mailing shall be to such address as the department is able to ascertain by reasonable effort. Failure of the taxpayer to receive such notice or order, however mailed, shall not release the taxpayer from any obligation for any tax, increase, or penalties.

The department is authorized, but not required, to mail to taxpayers tax returns; however, failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the tax, when and as otherwise due and payable. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.100 Payment of tax.

Payment of admission tax or penalties may be made by legal tender under such procedures as the department may prescribe, but if such form of legal tender so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all penalties, and fees, the same as if such payment had not been tendered.

A return or remittance which is transmitted to the department by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing it.

All returns must be accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon. The department may refuse to accept any return which is not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon. When a return is not accepted because it is not accompanied by a remittance, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the procedures provided in Section 3.76.110 and to the imposition of penalties pursuant to Section 3.76.130.

The department shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received. If a taxpayer is subject to penalties imposed pursuant to Section 3.73.130, the department shall apply any payment remitted by the taxpayer for previous amounts due first to penalties, and then upon the current tax due, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)

If any person fails or refuses to file any return within the time period set forth in this chapter, or to make available for examination any records required by this chapter, the department may proceed, in such manner as it may deem best, to obtain facts and information on which to base its estimate of the tax due and payable, including but not limited to the examination of the books, records, and papers of any such person and may take evidence, on oath, of any person, relating to the subject of inquiry.

As soon as the department procures such facts and information as it is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax payable by any person who has failed or refused to file a return, it shall proceed to determine and assess against such person any tax or penalties, but such action shall not deprive such person from the opportunity to appeal as herein provided. Penalties shall be added to the assessment as provided in Section 3.76.130. The department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the total amount of such tax and penalties, which amount shall be paid within thirty days from the date of notice. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.120 Additional amounts due.

If upon examination of any returns or of any other information obtained by the department, it appears that any tax or penalty had been paid which is less than properly due, the department shall assess against the taxpayer such additional amount found to be due and may add thereto a penalty as prescribed in Section 3.76.130. The department shall notify the taxpayer of the additional amount due and the same shall be paid within thirty days from the date of such notice, or within such further time as the department may provide. If payment is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, the department shall add a penalty as prescribed in Section 3.76.130. If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent by the taxpayer to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of fifty percent of the additional tax found to be due shall be added by the department. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.130 Delinquent tax returns—Late payment—Penalty.

Penalties shall be assessed as follows:

2.    If any tax is not received by the department within eleven to twenty days after the due date, there shall be assessed a total penalty which shall be due immediately of seven and one-half percent of the amount of the tax due with a minimum penalty of ten dollars; and

3.    If any tax is not received by the department within twenty-one to thirty-one days after the due date, there shall be assessed a total penalty which shall be due immediately of ten percent of the amount of the tax due with a minimum penalty of twenty dollars;

4.    If any tax is not received by the department within thirty-two to sixty-two days after the due date, there shall be assessed a total penalty which shall be due immediately of fifteen percent of the amount of the tax due with a minimum penalty of twenty-five dollars;

5.    In addition to the above penalties, the department shall assess a penalty of twenty percent of all taxes due for each thirty day period in excess of sixty-two days that such taxes are past due. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.140 Ticket numbering—Counting number of admissions.

Whenever a charge is made for admission to any place, a serially numbered or reserved seat ticket shall be furnished to the person paying such charge unless written approval has been obtained from the director to use a turnstile or other counting device which will accurately count the number of paid admissions. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.150 Printing admission charges.

The established price of admission, any noncity tax, city tax, and the total price at which each admission ticket or card is sold, shall be conspicuously and indelibly printed or written on the face or back of that part of the ticket which is retained by the management of the place to which admission is gained. This requirement may be waived in regard to temporary or transient events, which due to time make it impossible to print up admission tickets. This waiver must be reviewed and authorized by the director prior to authorizing the event.

The admission tax due shall be based on the established price printed on each ticket. When a charge is made for admission, a sign must be posted in a conspicuous place at the entrance or ticket office which breaks down the admissions charge as follows:

Admission charge

The department or its duly authorized agent may examine any books, papers, records, or other data, or stock of merchandise bearing upon the amount of tax or penalty payable or upon the correctness of any return, or for the purpose of making a return when none has been made, or in order to ascertain whether a return should be made, and may require the attendance of any person at a time and place fixed by the department or its authorized agent in accordance with and to the extent authorized by applicable law. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.180 Suspension of business license and appeal procedure.

The director may request the city clerk to suspend the business license issued to any taxpayer who is in default of any payment of any tax or penalty or who failed to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter of the Poulsbo Municipal Code. The taxpayer shall be notified by mail of such suspension. The city may request that the business license be returned. The taxpayer’s business license shall remain suspended until such time as the taxpayer is in compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter. Any business license so suspended shall not be reinstated, nor shall a new business license be issued to the taxpayer, until the amount due has been paid, or provision for satisfactory compliance with all applicable code provisions has been entered into with the director. Such provision for satisfactory compliance shall be legally binding on the taxpayer. Any such taxpayer who continues to engage in business after his/her business license has been suspended shall be deemed to be operating without a business license and shall be subject to any or all penalties provided in the Poulsbo Municipal Code Section 5.04.130. Any such taxpayer whose business license is suspended pursuant to Poulsbo Municipal Code Section 5.04.110 may file a written notice of appeal to the city council within ten days of the city clerk’s decision to suspend. The procedure for appeal is set forth in Poulsbo Municipal Code Section 5.04.120. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.190 Successor to business.

Whenever any taxpayer shall quit business or otherwise dispose of his/her business, any tax payable hereunder shall become immediately due and payable and such taxpayer shall immediately make a return and pay the tax due; and if such tax is not paid by said taxpayer within ten days from the date of such sale, exchange or disposal, said purchaser or successor shall likewise thereupon become liable for the payment of the full amount of such tax plus accrued penalties.

No successor shall be liable for any tax or penalty due from the taxpayer from whom the successor has acquired a business or stock of goods if the successor gives written notice to the department of such acquisition and no assessment is issued by the department within six months of receipt of such notice against the former operator of the business. Nothing in this section is intended nor shall it be construed to prohibit the successor from engaging in business in the city pending resolution of the successor’s liability in accordance with the appeal procedures in Section 3.76.220.

If the department has determined that a taxpayer has ceased to do business within the city, the department may cancel that taxpayer’s business license. (Ord. 99-01 § 1 (part), 1999)


3.76.200 Tax constitutes debt.

3.76.210 Collection of tax.

The city may pursue collection of any fee, tax or penalty due and unpaid to the fullest extent and in any manner authorized by law, including but not limited to the filing of a civil action against the taxpayer for the payment of such debt or the use by the city of a collection agency for such purposes.

B.    The demand for parks and recreation facilities is proportionate to the size of a user population.

D.    Each type of land development described in this chapter will create demand for the acquisition or expansion of parks and the construction of recreational facilities and other park improvements.

E.    The fees established in Section 3.84.090 are derived from, based upon, and do not exceed the costs of providing additional park land and park improvements necessitated by the new land developments for which the fees are levied.

F.    This chapter is enacted under the authority of the Washington State Growth Management Act, codified at Chapter 36.70A RCW and at RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100.

G.    Pursuant to the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the city has reasonably adjusted the park impact fee amount for taxes and other revenue sources that are anticipated to be available to fund the park land and facility improvements, as identified in the city’s capital facilities plan, and as outlined in the park impact fee technical document. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.030 Purpose.

A.    The purpose of this chapter is to implement the capital facilities element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan and the GMA by:

1.    Ensuring that adequate park, open space and recreation facilities are available to serve new development;

2.    Maintaining the high quality of life in Poulsbo by ensuring that growth pays for growth and that existing service levels for existing residents and businesses are not adversely impacted by growth and new development activity; and

3.    Establishing standards and procedures whereby new development pays its proportionate share of the cost of park, open space and recreation facilities that are reasonably related to the new development, and whereby park, open space and recreation facilities are jointly financed by public and private interests.

B.    The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out its purpose in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)

D.    Development for which a voluntary agreement (developer’s agreement) has been entered into pursuant to RCW 82.02.020 and which agreement calls for the dedication of land, construction of improvements, or payment of transportation impact fees in a specified amount at a date subsequent to execution of the agreement.

E.    Alteration, expansion, remodeling, reconstruction, or replacement of existing single-family or multifamily dwelling units that does not result in the creation of additional dwelling units.

F.    Construction of accessory residential structures that are secondary and associated with a primary single-family or multifamily structure, such as sheds, greenhouses or similar structures.

G.    Any building permit for a new legal accessory dwelling unit approved under Title 18, Zoning; it is considered an accessory use of the single-family residence, and therefore its impacts are within the realm of the primary single-family residential use.

H.    Demolition of or moving an existing structure within the city from one site to another. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.110 Credits.

A.    Pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(3), a reasonable credit shall be allowed for the dedication of land for, improvements to, or new construction of any park system improvements provided by a developer, to park, open space or recreation facilities identified in the capital facilities plan of the comprehensive plan and that are the subject of impact fees to be paid by the developer under this chapter. Any request for a credit against impact fees shall be made no later than the time of the application triggering the imposition of impact fees.

B.    All land proposed to be conveyed to the city in exchange for a credit against impact fees shall meet all of the following requirements:

1.    The land must have a minimum site area of two acres.

2.    The land must be conveyed free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.

3.    The land must be readily accessible to the general public.

4.    The land must have a site, size, and location consistent with a park system improvement generally described in the comprehensive plan’s parks chapter and capital facilities plan.

5.    The land must be improved with and contain three or more facilities recommended in the comprehensive plan or Poulsbo park, recreation and open space plan for the appropriate population density the land and improvements are intended to serve.

6.    The land must be suitable for the proposed park uses and for inclusion in the city’s park system, as determined by the parks and recreation director.

7.    The city may decide to accept land which does not meet all of these standards in unusual circumstances where the land to be conveyed provides a unique benefit, such as where the land has waterfront access, or provides significant open space or trail corridor.

C.    The amount of the credit shall be the value of the land and improvements conveyed to the city; provided, that in no case shall the amount of the credit exceed the amount of the impact fee imposed on the development activity. If the value of the land and improvements exceeds the total park impact fees to be paid by the development, no impact fees shall be due. If the value of the land and improvements is less than the impact fees due, the developer will be required to pay the difference.

D.    The value of the land and improvements for which a credit is sought shall be measured as follows:

1.    The value of the land will be based upon the assessed value of the land to be conveyed, as shown in the most recent records of the county assessor, unless the developer provides an appraisal of the fair market value of the land completed by a qualified real estate appraiser, in which case the value of the land will be based upon the said fair market value if the planning director and parks and recreation director determine that the appraisal is satisfactory.

2.    The value of the improvements will be based upon construction cost estimates for the proposed park and recreation improvements, including any directly related site work, as approved by the planning director and parks and recreation director.

E.    Credits shall not be transferable from one property, project, or development activity to another. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.120 Adjustments.

The planning director and parks and recreation director are authorized to adjust the impact fees to be calculated under this chapter where the developer demonstrates that unusual circumstances make the standard impact fee applied to such development unfair or unjust. The circumstances that form the basis for the adjustment shall not be circumstances that are generally applicable to similar land uses or to all development activity in the vicinity. Unusual circumstances may include that the development activity will have substantially less impact on the system improvements than other development activities in the same land use category. Any request for an adjustment shall be made no later than the time of the application triggering imposition of impact fees. Adjustments granted under this section shall not be transferable from one property, project or development activity to another. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.130 Calculation of impact fees based upon independent study.

Fees shall be calculated in accordance with Section 3.84.090 unless:

A.    A developer submits to the planning director and parks and recreation director studies and data in accordance with RCW 82.02.060(5) that support a claim for adjustment in the amount of the fee. The studies and data submitted shall clearly show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

1.    The study shall follow accepted impact fee assessment practices and methodologies.

2.    The study shall use acceptable data sources and the land uses from which the data was compiled, and shall be comparable to the uses and intensities of the proposed development activity. Unusual circumstances that clearly demonstrate that the proposed development will have substantially less impact on the park system than other development activities may be presented in the study.

3.    The study shall comply with applicable state laws governing imposition of impact fees.

4.    The study, including any data collection and analysis, shall be prepared and documented by professionals qualified in the park and planning fields.

5.    The study shall clearly show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

B.    The planning director and parks and recreation director shall consider the study and any other documentation submitted by the developer, but are not required to accept the study if they decide that the study is not accurate or reliable. The planning director and parks and recreation director may, in the alternative, require that the developer submit additional or different studies, documents, or information for consideration. If the planning director and parks and recreation director determine that outside expertise is needed to review the study, the city may obtain the services of outside experts and the developer will be required to pay the costs of such services.

C.    If the study is not acceptable, the developer shall be required to pay the impact fees based upon Section 3.84.090. If the study is acceptable, the planning director and parks and recreation director may adjust the fee to that amount which is appropriate to the particular development activity.

D.    The city council may establish a fee for staff review of the independent studies authorized by this section. If such a fee is established, the fee shall be paid at the time the study is submitted. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.135 Deferral of single-family residential impact fees.

A.    An applicant for a building permit for a single-family detached or attached residence may request a deferral of the full impact fee payment until the date of final inspection or eighteen months from the date of building permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of impact fees shall be granted under the conditions set forth in this section.

B.    An applicant for deferral must request the deferral no later than the time of issuance of a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.

C.    To receive a deferral, an applicant must:

1.    Submit a separate application for deferral for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the applicant wishes to defer payment of the impact fees. Each application must be accompanied by the nonrefundable administrative fee established by resolution of the city council in order to reimburse the city for all costs associated with the deferral.

2.    Grant and record a deferred impact fee lien against the property in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee. The deferred impact fee lien must:

a.    Be in a form approved by the city;

b.    Signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed;

c.    Include the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property;

d.    Be recorded in Kitsap County;

e.    Be binding on all successors in title after the recordation; and

f.    Be junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

D.    The amount of the impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

E.    The city shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the city shall execute a release of the deferred impact fee lien for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or the property owner at the time of the release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at his or her expense.

F.    The extinguishing of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation of the applicant or the property owner to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

G.    If impact fees are not paid in accordance with the deferral and in accordance with the terms and conditions provided in this section, the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

H.    Each applicant for a single-family detached or attached residential construction permit, in accordance with his or her contractor registration number or other unique identification number, shall be entitled to receive annually deferrals for the first twenty single-family residential construction building permits. For purposes of this subsection, an “applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant. (Ord. 2016-13 § 2, 2016)


3.84.140 Payments under protest.

Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a final plat recording or building permit. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.150 Appeals.

Any decision made by the planning director and parks and recreation director under this chapter may be appealed in accord with the procedures for appealing the underlying permit or development approval and shall not be subject to a separate appeal process. All appeals shall follow the procedures set forth in Title 19. The impact fee may be modified upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principles of fairness. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.160 Impact fee accounts and expenditures.

A.    A park impact fee account is hereby established for the purpose of depositing and maintaining the funds received under this chapter and any previously collected park impact fees paid pursuant to SEPA or other authority. The city finance department shall earmark all funds collected under this chapter and under such previous collections as to the person paying, the date paid, and the development or property for which paid. The account shall be separate from all other accounts of the city and shall be interest-bearing. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fee was imposed.

B.    Impact fees shall only be expended for park, open space and recreation facilities described in and in conformance with the capital facilities plan. Impact fees may be expended for facility planning, land acquisition, site improvements, application fees, necessary off-site improvements, required mitigation, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, relocatable facilities, capital equipment, repayment of system improvement costs previously incurred to the extent that new growth and development will be served by such system improvements, and any other expenses which could be capitalized and which are consistent with the capital facilities element.

C.    In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with provisions of the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities are consistent with the requirements of this section.

D.    Impact fees imposed under this chapter shall be expended or encumbered for a permissible use within ten years of the date they are received by the city, unless the city council finds that there exists an extraordinary and compelling reason for the fees to be held longer than ten years. Such a finding shall be made in writing.

E.    Impact fees collected under the authority of SEPA and the voluntary agreement provisions of RCW 82.02.020 shall be expended or encumbered for a permissible use within five years of the date they are received by the city.

F.    As part of the city’s budget* cycle, the parks and recreation director shall present a proposed capital improvement program (CIP) for parks, assigning funds to specific park acquisition or improvement projects and related expenses. Moneys not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the park impact fee special revenue fund until the next fiscal period, except as provided by the refund provisions of this chapter.

G.    Funds may be used to provide refunds as described in Section 3.84.170.

H.    The city may establish a fee for staff administration of impact fees authorized by this chapter. If such a fee is established, the fee shall be identified in the city’s fee schedule. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)

*    Code reviser’s note: Ord. 2016-09 (codified at Chapter 3.02) changed the city’s budget from annual to biennial. The word “annual” has been removed from this section to reflect that change.


3.84.170 Impact fee refunds.

A.    The current owner of property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees, or any portion thereof, if the city has failed to expend or encumber the impact fees, or any applicable portion, within the time periods specified in Section 3.84.160.

B.    The city shall notify potential claimants for impact fee refunds by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of the said claimants.

C.    A request for a refund must be submitted to the city council in writing within one year of the date that the right to claim the refund arises or the date that the notice is given, whichever is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered and for which no application for refund has been made within the one-year period shall be retained and expended on the indicated capital facilities. Refunds under this subsection shall include interest earned on the impact fees; provided, that if the city’s failure to expend or encumber the fee within the time periods set forth in Section 3.84.160 is due to delay attributable to the developer of the project for which the fee was collected, the refund shall be without interest.

D.    If the city should terminate the impact fee requirements of this chapter, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon a determination to terminate such impact fee requirements, the city shall publish a notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in the city’s official newspaper at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail at the last known address of claimants. A request for a refund must be submitted to the city council in writing within one year of the date that the notice is given. Any impact fees for which no application for refund has been made within the one-year period shall be retained and expended on the indicated capital facilities. No notice shall be required if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account at the time of termination.

E.    A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when the developer does not proceed with the development activity and no impact has resulted.

F.    When providing a refund, the city shall include the interest earned by the city on the impact fee while it was deposited into the required special interest bearing account. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.84.180 Annual impact fee report.

The city finance department, in conjunction with the planning director and parks and recreation director, shall prepare an annual report to the city council showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received and the park, open space and recreation system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees imposed under this chapter. The report may be part of an existing annual report or may be a separate report. (Ord. 2011-15 § 1 (part), 2011)

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Poulsbo Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance.” (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.020 Findings and authority.

The Poulsbo city council hereby finds and declares that:

A.    In order to maintain the adopted transportation level of service and continue to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare in the face of a growing population, the city of Poulsbo must expand and improve its transportation system.

B.    The city finds and determines that new growth and development, including but not limited to new residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial development, in the city of Poulsbo will create additional demand and need on the public transportation system, and finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of new facilities needed to serve the new growth and development.

C.    This chapter is enacted under the authority of the Washington State Growth Management Act, codified at Chapter 36.70A RCW and at RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100.

D.    Pursuant to the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the city has reasonably adjusted the transportation impact fee amount for taxes and other revenue sources that are anticipated to be available to fund the transportation facility improvements. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.030 Purpose.

A.    The purpose of this chapter is to implement the capital facilities element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan and the GMA by:

1.    Ensuring that adequate transportation facilities are available to serve new development;

2.    Maintaining the high quality of life in Poulsbo by ensuring that growth pays for growth and that existing service levels for existing residents and businesses are not adversely impacted by growth and new development activity; and

3.    Establishing standards and procedures whereby new development pays its proportionate share of the cost of transportation capital facilities that are reasonably related to the new development, and whereby transportation capital facilities are jointly financed by public and private interests.

B.    The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out its purpose in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)

B.    As provided in the comprehensive plan, the city’s level of service standard for transportation capital facilities is LOS E and as set forth in the city’s comprehensive plan.

C.    The level of service standard set forth in subsection B of this section is met for existing development and increased demand and need associated with growth and new development will require acquisition of right-of-way and construction of transportation capital facilities in order to maintain this level of service. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.080 Imposition of transportation impact fees.

A.    Transportation impact fees shall be required as a condition of development approval for any and all new development activity within the city to which this chapter applies.

B.    The transportation impact fee shall be calculated at the current rate at the time the impact fee becomes due and payable as required in subsection C of this section. The city engineer and planning director are authorized to impose transportation impact fees on any and all new development and to condition, withhold or revoke approval of any such development unless the transportation impact fees are paid when due.

C.    Transportation impact fees shall become due and payable to the city at the time of building permit issuance. If a building permit is not required, then the transportation impact fees are due at the time of development approval.

D.    For a change in use of an existing building or dwelling unit (which may also include any alteration, expansion, replacement or new accessory building), the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to an impact fee for the existing use; provided, that the existing use was in effect after April 2016.

E.    The building official shall not issue any building permit, or certificate of occupancy if no building permit is required, unless and until the impact fee has been paid. (Ord. 2019-10 § 1, 2019: Ord. 2017-08 § 1, 2017: Ord. 2016-13 § 3, 2016; Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.090 Calculating transportation impact fee amount.

A.    The transportation impact fee to be paid by new development shall be calculated by multiplying five hundred sixty-four dollars times the number of average weekday (awd) trips generated by the development that is the subject of the development approval. Average weekday trips shall be determined using the latest version of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) for the land use(s) that are the subject of the permit.

1.    The methodology by which the transportation impact fee was derived is set forth in the Transportation Impact Fee Technical Document, dated March 2019, a copy of which is on file with the city clerk and which is incorporated herein by this reference as if set forth in full.

2.    In the event the latest version of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers does not identify an average weekday trip (awdt) for a land use, the city will use the weekday peak hour trips (wdpht) multiplied by ten.

B.    If the development land use does not fit into any of the categories specified in the land use table in the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, the city engineer shall use the most directly comparable type of land use. For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each land use.

C.    No transportation impact fee shall be collected if the transportation improvements are incapable of being reasonably accomplished because of lack of public funds. No impact fee shall be imposed by the city on a development when mitigation for the same transportation impact of the development is being required by any other governmental agency pursuant to any other local, state, or federal law.

D.    The impact fee imposed by this section should be reviewed whenever the transportation system level of service standard is amended, whenever the list of needed improvements is amended in the capital facilities plan, whenever the city’s projected new population assumption is updated, but no less than every eight years as part of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan periodic update cycle.

E.    Failure of the city to review or amend the fee schedule shall not be a prerequisite to the continued imposition of fees under this chapter.

F.    Cost Indexing. At the end of any twelve-month period in which the portion of the city’s capital facilities plan listing system improvements that are the basis for transportation impact fees is not updated, the transportation impact fee amount shall be adjusted by the same amount as the percentage change in the June Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue CPI-U for the most recent twelve-month period prior to the date of the adjustment. (Ord. 2019-10 § 2, 2019: Ord. 2017-08 § 2, 2017: Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.100 Exemptions.

The following are exempt from the payment of impact fees under this chapter:

A.    Development for which land has been dedicated, improvements constructed, or impact fees paid under SEPA and which land, improvements, or fees the city has previously determined to be sufficient to mitigate the transportation impacts of the development.

B.    Existing development for which an impact fee has already been paid under this chapter (except as set forth in Section 3.86.080(D)).

C.    Development for which a voluntary agreement (developer’s agreement) has been entered into pursuant to RCW 82.02.020 and which agreement calls for the dedication of land, construction of improvements, or payment of transportation impact fees in a specified amount at a date subsequent to execution of the agreement.

D.    Alteration, expansion, remodeling, reconstruction, or replacement of existing single-family or multifamily dwelling units that does not result in the creation of additional dwelling units.

E.    Alteration, expansion, reconstruction, remodeling or replacement of an existing nonresidential building that does not result in an increase in the average daily trips generated by the building.

F.    Any building permit for a new legal accessory dwelling unit approved under Title 18, Zoning; it is considered an accessory use of the single-family residence, and therefore its impacts are within the realm of the primary single-family residential use.

G.    Any building permit in association with a home occupation or home business approved under Title 18, Zoning; it is considered an accessory use of the residence, and therefore its impacts are within the realm of the primary residential use.

H.    Any building permit(s) in association with a public park. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.110 Credits.

A.    Pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(4), a reasonable credit shall be allowed for the dedication of land for, improvements to, or new construction of any transportation system improvements provided by a developer, to transportation capital facilities identified in the capital facilities plan of the comprehensive plan and that are the subject of impact fees to be paid by the developer under this chapter as set forth in the transportation impact fee technical document. Any request for a credit against impact fees shall be made no later than the time of the application triggering the imposition of impact fees, or in the case of platted developments no later than the time of final plat application. Improvements constructed shall be consistent with the project description in the capital facilities plan and the current project design at the time of construction drawing approval. No credit shall be given for project improvements.

B.    The amount of the credit shall be the value of the land and improvements conveyed to the city; provided, that in no case shall the amount of the credit exceed the amount of the impact fee imposed on the development activity. If the value of the land and improvements exceed the total transportation impact fees to be paid by the development, no impact fees shall be due. If the value of the land and improvements is less than the impact fees due, the developer will be required to pay the difference.

C.    The value of the land and improvements for which a credit is sought shall be measured as follows:

1.    The value of the land will be based upon the assessed value of the land to be conveyed, as shown in the most recent records of the county assessor, unless the developer provides an appraisal of the fair market value of the land completed by a qualified real estate appraiser, in which case the value of the land will be based upon the said fair market value if the planning director and city engineer determine that the appraisal is satisfactory.

2.    The value of the improvements will be based upon construction cost estimates for the proposed transportation capital improvements, including any directly related site work, and as approved by the planning director and city engineer. The cost estimate shall not include costs for financing, overhead or other costs not associated with the actual physical construction of the improvement.

D.    Credits shall not be transferable from one property, project, or development activity to another. (Ord. 2019-10 § 3, 2019: Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.120 Adjustments.

The planning director and city engineer are authorized to adjust the impact fees to be calculated under this chapter where the developer demonstrates that unusual circumstances make the standard impact fee applied to such development unfair or unjust. The circumstances that form the basis for the adjustment shall not be circumstances that are generally applicable to similar land uses or to all development activity in the vicinity. Unusual circumstances may include that the development activity will have substantially less impact on the system improvements than other development activities in the same land use category. Any request for an adjustment shall be made no later than the time of the application triggering imposition of impact fees, or in the case of platted developments no later than the time of final plat application. Adjustments granted under this section shall not be transferable from one property, project or development activity to another. (Ord. 2019-10 § 4, 2019: Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.130 Calculation of impact fees based upon independent study.

A.    A developer may elect not to have the impact fees for a proposed development activity determined according to Section 3.86.090. In such case, the developer, at his/her expense, must submit an independent fee calculation study for the proposed development activity meeting the following standards:

1.    The study shall follow accepted impact fee assessment practices and methodologies.

2.    The study shall use acceptable data sources and the uses from which the data was compiled shall be comparable to the uses and intensities proposed for the proposed development activity. Unusual circumstances that clearly demonstrate that the proposed development will have substantially less impact on the transportation system than other development activities may be presented in the study.

3.    The study shall comply with applicable state laws governing imposition of impact fees.

4.    The study, including any data collection and analysis, shall be prepared and documented by professionals qualified in the transportation engineering and planning fields.

5.    The study shall clearly show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

B.    The planning director and city engineer shall consider the study and any other documentation submitted by the developer, but are not required to accept the study if they decide that the study is not accurate or reliable. The planning director and city engineer may, in the alternative, require that the developer submit additional or different studies, documents, or information for consideration. If the planning director and city engineer determine that outside expertise is needed to review the study, the city may obtain the services of outside experts and the developer will be required to pay the costs of such services.

C.    If the study is not acceptable, the developer shall be required to pay the impact fees based upon Section 3.86.090. If the study is acceptable, the planning director and city engineer may adjust the fee to that amount which is appropriate to the particular development activity.

D.    The city council may establish a fee for staff review of the independent studies authorized by this section. If such a fee is established, the fee shall be paid at the time the study is submitted. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.135 Deferral of single-family residential impact fees.

A.    An applicant for a building permit for a single-family detached or attached residence may request a deferral of the full impact fee payment until the date of final inspection or eighteen months from the date of building permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of impact fees shall be granted under the conditions set forth in this section.

B.    An applicant for deferral must request the deferral no later than the time of issuance of a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.

C.    To receive a deferral, an applicant must:

1.    Submit a separate application for deferral for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the applicant wishes to defer payment of the impact fees. Each application must be accompanied by the nonrefundable administrative fee established by resolution of the city council in order to reimburse the city for all costs associated with the deferral.

2.    Grant and record a deferred impact fee lien against the property in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee. The deferred impact fee lien must:

a.    Be in a form approved by the city;

b.    Signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed;

c.    Include the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property;

d.    Be recorded in Kitsap County;

e.    Be binding on all successors in title after the recordation; and

f.    Be junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

D.    The amount of the impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

E.    The city shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the city shall execute a release of the deferred impact fee lien for each single-family detached or attached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or the property owner at the time of the release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at his or her expense.

F.    The extinguishing of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation of the applicant or the property owner to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

G.    If impact fees are not paid in accordance with the deferral and in accordance with the terms and conditions provided in this section, the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

H.    Each applicant for a single-family detached or attached residential construction permit, in accordance with his or her contractor registration number or other unique identification number, shall be entitled to receive annually deferrals for the first twenty single-family residential construction building permits. For purposes of this subsection, an “applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant. (Ord. 2016-13 § 4, 2016)


3.86.140 Payments under protest.

Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a site plan approval or building permit. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.150 Appeals.

Any decision made by the planning director and city engineer under this chapter may be appealed in accord with the procedures for appealing the underlying permit or development approval and shall not be subject to a separate appeal process. All appeals shall follow the procedures set forth in Title 19. The impact fee may be modified upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principles of fairness. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.160 Impact fee accounts and expenditures.

A.    A transportation impact fee account is hereby established for the purpose of depositing and maintaining the funds received under this chapter and any previously collected transportation impact fees paid pursuant to SEPA or other authority. The city finance department shall earmark all funds collected under this chapter and under such previous collections as to the person paying, the date paid, and the development or property for which paid. The account shall be interest-bearing. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fee was imposed.

B.    Impact fees shall only be expended for transportation capital facilities described in and in conformance with the capital facilities plan. Impact fees may be expended for facility planning, land acquisition, site improvements, application fees, necessary off-site improvements, required mitigation, construction, engineering, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, relocatable facilities, capital equipment, repayment of system improvement costs previously incurred to the extent that new growth and development will be served by such system improvements, and any other expenses which could be capitalized and which are consistent with the capital facilities element.

C.    In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with provisions of the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities are consistent with the requirements of this section.

D.    Impact fees imposed under this chapter shall be expended or encumbered for a permissible use within ten years of the date they are received by the city, unless the city council finds that there exists an extraordinary and compelling reason for the fees to be held longer than ten years. Such a finding shall be made in writing.

E.    Impact fees collected under the authority of SEPA and the voluntary agreement provisions of RCW 82.02.020 shall be expended or encumbered for a permissible use within five years of the date they are received by the city.

F.    As part of the city’s budget* cycle, the city engineer shall present a proposed capital improvement program (CIP) for streets, assigning funds to specific transportation improvement projects and related expenses. Moneys not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the transportation impact fee special revenue fund until the next fiscal period, except as provided by the refund provisions of this chapter.

G.    Funds may be used to provide refunds as described in Section 3.86.170.

H.    The city may establish a fee for staff administration of impact fees authorized by this chapter. If such a fee is established, the fee shall be identified in the city’s fee schedule. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)

*    Code reviser’s note: Ord. 2016-09 (codified at Chapter 3.02) changed the city’s budget from annual to biennial. The word “annual” has been removed from this section to reflect that change.


3.86.170 Impact fee refunds.

A.    The current owner of property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees, or any portion thereof, if the city has failed to expend or encumber the impact fees, or any applicable portion, within the time periods specified in Section 3.86.160.

B.    The city shall notify potential claimants for impact fee refunds by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of the said claimants.

C.    A request for a refund must be submitted to the city council in writing within one year of the date that the right to claim the refund arises or the date that the notice is given, whichever is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered and for which no application for refund has been made within the one-year period shall be retained and expended on the indicated capital facilities. Refunds under this subsection shall include interest earned on the impact fees; provided, that if the city’s failure to expend or encumber the fee within the time periods set forth in Section 3.86.160 is due to delay attributable to the developer of the project for which the fee was collected, the refund shall be without interest.

D.    If the city should terminate the impact fee requirements of this chapter, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon a determination to terminate such impact fee requirements, the city shall publish a notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in the city’s official newspaper at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail at the last known address of claimants. A request for a refund must be submitted to the city council in writing within one year of the date that the notice is given. Any impact fees for which no application for refund has been made within the one-year period shall be retained and expended on the indicated capital facilities. No notice shall be required if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account at the time of termination.

E.    A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when the developer does not proceed with the development activity and no impact has resulted.

F.    When providing a refund, the city shall include the interest earned by the city on the impact fee while it was deposited into the required special interest bearing account. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)


3.86.180 Annual impact fee report.

The city finance department, in conjunction with the planning director and city engineer, shall prepare an annual report to the city council showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received and the transportation system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees imposed under this chapter. The report may be part of an existing annual report or may be a separate report. (Ord. 2011-16 § 1 (part), 2011)

5.06.010 Purpose.

It is the intended purpose of this chapter to recognize the importance and benefits of freedom of expression to a democratic society. Experience has shown, however, that adult entertainment facilities, as defined herein, are detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Adult entertainment facilities are historically linked with organized crime, prostitution, narcotics, and other unlawful and criminal activity. These activities often lead to the development of public nuisances, including moral nuisances. Therefore, the licensing and operation of adult entertainment facilities should be regulated and monitored through the system of licensing and operating regulations contained in this chapter. (Ord. 2001-03 § 3 (part), 2001)


5.06.020 Scope.

This chapter governs the licensing and operation of all adult entertainment facilities within the city. The location and siting of adult entertainment facilities is governed by the zoning regulations contained in Chapter 18.08 and Section 18.48.020 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code. All adult entertainment facilities shall satisfy the requirements of both this chapter and Chapter 18.08 and Section 18.48.020 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code. In the event that there is any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the general business license regulations contained in Chapter 5.04 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code, or the licensing regulations for escort bureaus, escorts, and introductory services contained in Chapter 5.10 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code, then the provisions of this chapter shall control.

No fee, indemnification agreement or insurance requirement shall be imposed when prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Political or religious activity intended primarily for the communication or expression of ideas shall be presumed to be a constitutionally protected event. Factors that may be considered in evaluating whether or not the fee applies include the nature of the event, the extent of commercial activity, such as the sales of food, goods, and services, product advertising or promotion, or other business participation in the event, the use or application of any funds raised, if part of any annual tradition or series, previous events in the sequence, and the public perception of the event.

A.    Indemnification Agreement. Prior to the issuance of a permit for a special event not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the permit applicant and authorized officer of the sponsoring organization must agree to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by it in repairing damage to city property and indemnify, defend and hold the city, its officers, employees, volunteers and agents harmless from all causes of action, claims or liabilities occurring in connection with the permitted event, except those which occur due to the city’s sole negligence.

B.    Insurance. The types and amounts of insurance required shall be determined by the city and based on the risk exposure of the event (liability limit requirement will be at least one million dollars per occurrence), for all events not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.

The risk manager is authorized and directed to require written proof of such insurance prior to permit issuance. A liability insurance policy shall be written on an occurrence basis, shall name the city of Poulsbo as an additional insured using ISO form CG 2012 or CG 2026, or coverage at least as broad, shall be written for a period not less than twenty-four hours prior to the event and extending for a period not less than twenty-four hours following the completion of the event. The applicant shall provide the city and all additional insureds for this event with written notice of any policy cancellation within two business days of their receipt of such notice.

5.30.110 Fees for city services.

A.    Upon approval of an application for a permit for a special event not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the administrator should provide the applicant with an estimated cost of providing city personnel and equipment prior to permit issuance. The applicant must sign off on the anticipated charges. Actual costs will be billed to the applicant after the event. City services and equipment may include the use of police officers and public employees for traffic and crowd control, pickup and delivery of traffic control devices, picnic tables, extraordinary street sweeping, and any other needed, requested or required city services and the cost of operating the equipment to provide such services.

B.    Permit fees and fees for the use of city services and equipment may be waived in part or in full by the city via council resolution, if in review of the application it is found that the event is of sufficient public benefit to warrant the expenditure of city funds without reimbursement by the applicant and would not result in the private financial gain of any individual or “for profit” entity. (Ord. 2020-02 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2020)


5.30.120 Revocation of permits.

A.    Any permit issued under this chapter may be summarily revoked by the administrator or his/her designee at any time when, by reason of disaster, public calamity, riot or other emergency or exigent circumstances, the city determines the safety of the public or property requires such immediate revocation. In the event of a revocation caused by an emergency or exigent circumstance, the city shall refund the balance of the fee less the costs incurred through the effective date of the cancellation.

B.    The city may also summarily revoke any permit issued pursuant to this chapter if the city finds that the permit has been issued based upon false information or when the permittee exceeds the scope of the permit or fails to comply with any condition of the permit. Notice of such action revoking a permit shall be delivered in writing to the permittee by certified mail at the address specified by the permittee in the application.

C.    The chief of police, fire chief, planning director, or public works superintendent, or their designees, shall have the authority to revoke a permit issued hereunder instantly upon violation of any one or more of the code ordinances or conditions or standards of issuance as herein set forth. (Ord. 2020-02 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2020)


5.30.130 Violation—Penalty.

A.    It shall be unlawful for any person to sponsor or conduct a special event requiring a special event permit pursuant to this chapter unless a valid permit has been issued and remains in effect for the event. It is unlawful for any person to participate in such an event with the knowledge that the sponsor of the event has not been issued a required, valid permit or with knowledge that a once valid permit has expired or been revoked.

B.    The special event permit authorizes the permittee to conduct only such an event as is described in the permit, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit. It is unlawful for the permittee to willfully violate the terms and conditions of the permit, or for any event participant with knowledge thereof to willfully violate the terms and conditions of the permit or to continue with the event if the permit is revoked or expired.

C.    Any person and the officers, directors, managing agents, or partners of any corporation, firm, partnership or other organization or business violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall have committed a civil infraction and, upon a determination by the Poulsbo municipal court that such infraction has been committed, shall pay a civil monetary penalty to the city of a sum not to exceed two hundred dollars. In addition, each and every day during any portion of which a violation of any provision of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted constitutes a separate infraction. Penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the city’s general fund to be used for general purposes of the city.

D.    In addition to the penalties provided in this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a public nuisance and all remedies given by law for the prevention and abatement of nuisances shall apply thereto.

Each day that such condition or violation continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense and shall be punishable accordingly. (Ord. 2020-02 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2020)


5.30.140 Savings clause.

If any section, sentence, clause, phrase, part or portion of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter, which shall continue in full force and effect.

Any such appeal shall be filed within thirty days as provided in the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (RALJ) and shall be governed by and subject to such rules.

9.60.010 Definitions.

“Enforcement officer” means a law enforcement officer, code enforcement officer or other person or persons appointed by the city council for purposes of enforcing this chapter.

“Graffiti” means the defacing, damaging or destroying by etching, scratching, spraying of paint or marking of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public or private buildings, structures, places and property, both real and personal.

“Graffiti abatement procedure” means the abatement procedure, which identifies graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in absence of response.

“Private contractor” means any person with whom the city shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti. (Ord. 2007-37 § 2, 2007: Ord. 97-33 § 1 (part), 1997)


9.60.015 Malicious mischief—Statutes adopted by reference.

Pursuant to the authority contained in RCW 35A.12.140, the following sections of Chapter 9A.48 RCW as enacted or hereinafter amended are hereby adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein including penalties:

RCW

9A.48.105    Criminal street gang tagging and graffiti

(Ord. 2008-17 § 1, 2008)


9.60.020 Graffiti deemed nuisance.

A.    Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.

B.    Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, obtaining convictions for such acts is difficult because the offenses involving graffiti can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the acts are frequently nonexistent.

C.    Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to the proper authorities, it is also important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the product of the illegal acts of those involved in application of graffiti is not visible and the property on which the graffiti is located and surrounding properties do not suffer diminution of value. (Ord. 2007-37 § 3, 2007: Ord. 97-33 § 1 (part), 1997)


9.60.030 Graffiti prohibited.

It shall be unlawful for any person to etch, scratch, write, paint or draw upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage or other structure, tree or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as “graffiti” within the city without permission from the city. Violation of any of the provisions of this section shall constitute a gross misdemeanor. (Ord. 2007-37 § 4, 2007: Ord. 97-33 § 1 (part), 1997)


9.60.040 Graffiti—Notice of removal.

A.    Whenever an enforcement officer determines that graffiti exists on any public or private buildings, structures, places, or other real or personal property which are visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right-of-way within the city and when weather conditions permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the city engineer or designee shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The responsible party shall have fifteen days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city. If the graffiti is on personal property, which is removable from public view (such as an automobile), the responsible party shall have forty-eight hours to remove the property from public view.

B.    The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be served upon the responsible party of the affected premises by mail at the party’s last known address. The notice shall also be posted at the property. As an alternative to mailing the notice, the enforcement officer may cause a copy of the notice to be personally served to the responsible party in the manner authorized by statute for personal service. The notice shall be in substantially the following form:

NOTICE TO ABATE GRAFFITI

Date:

To:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to Chapter 9.60 of the city of Poulsbo Municipal Code, the city of Poulsbo has determined that there is a graffiti nuisance located on the property commonly known as [address], Poulsbo, Washington, which is visible to public view. You are required, at your own expense, to remove or paint over the graffiti within fifteen (15) days after the date of this notice [or if the graffiti is on removable personal property to remove the personal property from public view within forty-eight hours after the date of this notice]; or, if you fail to do so, the city requires the nuisance to be abated by removal or painting over of the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the city or private contractors employed by the city to abate the nuisance will be assessed upon your property and such costs will constitute a lien upon the land until paid.

In addition, if the graffiti is not removed or abated by the time specified, the city may begin issuing civil infractions pursuant to Poulsbo Municipal Code Section 9.60.080.

You may appeal this Notice to Abate Graffiti decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the city council of the city of Poulsbo within ten days after the date of this notice.

(Ord. 2007-37 § 5, 2007)


9.60.050 Graffiti city costs enforceable—Debt—Lien.

Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this chapter shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the responsible party and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property upon which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. (Ord. 2007-37 § 6, 2007)


9.60.060 Graffiti appeal.

Within ten days from the mailing or from personal service of the notice of intent to remove graffiti, the responsible party or person occupying or managing the premises affected may appeal the matter to the city council. Filing of an appeal will stay, during the pendency of the appeal, any enforcement or actions by the city to abate the graffiti nuisance. (Ord. 2007-37 § 7, 2007)


9.60.070 Graffiti removal by city.

Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the enforcement officer approves, then the graffiti may be abated by city forces or by private contract; provided, that the city obtains a court order to do so or the property owner or another person with authority over the property consents to such abatement. The city or its private contractor will enter upon the premises for graffiti abatement purposes during regular business hours or at times mutually agreeable with the property owner or occupant. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city. If the city provides for the removal of the graffiti, it shall not authorize nor undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located. When graffiti is painted over, the city or its private contractor shall attempt to match the paint with the underlying color of the defaced surface. Property owners in the city of Poulsbo may consent in advance to city entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes. (Ord. 2007-37 § 8, 2007)


9.60.080 Graffiti civil infraction.

In addition to any other remedy provided in this chapter, any responsible party violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a civil infraction, subject to a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars. Each five-day calendar period that a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. (Ord. 2007-37 § 9, 2007)

11.04.020 Policy guidelines.

The administration of this title shall be governed by the following telecommunications policy guidelines:

A.    The city supports efforts to establish an open, competitive marketplace for telecommunications services. The city promotes and encourages competition for voice, data, video, and video programming services that make the latest and best technology available and keep service prices affordable for all city residents and businesses. An integral component of this open marketplace is the consistent application of regulations to all telecommunications providers and the preservation of local authority over matters of local impact.

B.    The following policy guidelines express the commitment of the city to support telecommunications services and to manage its rights-of-way proactively while balancing the interests and needs of the community:

1.    The city will manage access to the public rights-of-way for telecommunications purposes in a non-discriminatory, competitively neutral and non-exclusive way to the extent required under applicable law and, to the extent allowed under applicable law, to receive fair compensation. The public interest will be protected by collecting associated fees, taxes, administrative costs, and construction costs for use of the rights-of-way.

2.    Telecommunications master permits will be managed to preserve the integrity of the city’s infrastructure, ensure efficient use of city property and ensure compliance with city ordinances, rules and regulations.

3.    In order to effectively manage and regulate the use of public rights-of-way by private entities in the best interests of the city and its citizens it is necessary for the city to reserve and exercise all legislative, administrative and discretionary authority it may have to the full extent allowed or not prohibited by law and nothing in this title shall be construed to diminish or in any way to limit the discretionary, administrative or legislative authority of the city and its officials as respects the management and use of the city’s public rights-of-way or in respect to the granting, delaying, or denying any master permit, ROW permit or license.

(Ord. 2001-21 (part), 2001)


11.04.040 Master permit required.

A.    Master Permit Requirement. An operator of a telecommunications facility must obtain a master permit prior to constructing a telecommunications facility or providing telecommunications services. The fact that a particular master permitted communications facility may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a master permit for other purposes unless applicable federal or state law prohibits the city from requiring such additional master permit. No master permit shall become effective without the grantee signing an acceptance of the master permit.

B.    Exceptions. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, a master permit requirement may be waived in whole or in part for a telecommunications system where the city determines the use of the public rights-of-way is de minimus (i.e. uses only a short distance of street or occupies only a small isolated area of a specific street). For such facilities, the city may issue a license. In addition, every private communications system owner must obtain a license. Every license shall include or be read to include, as if stated therein, a reservation of rights by the city to require the licensee to obtain a master permit if the city determines that the licensee’s use of the public right-of-way has increased substantially and is no longer de minimus use.

C.    Additional Exceptions. The city does request that any operator now providing telecommunications service within the city over an existing telecommunication system within the public rights-of-way of the city without having a master permit from the city granting and allowing such use at the time this provision becomes effective apply for a master permit from the city for such use of the public rights-of-way. In the event such operator fails to request a master permit within sixty days from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title and such operator submits evidence satisfactory to the city that it is involved in pending litigation wherein the operator claims the operator has an existing state-wide grant to occupy the public right-of-way or the operator otherwise submits a non-frivolous and documented claim that it has an existing state-wide grant to occupy public right-of-way, including streets in the city, then in such event the requirement for obtaining a master permit for the continued use of public right-of-way in Poulsbo for existing wireline facilities will be suspended until there is a final judicial decision resolving the issue or the city by decision of its city council determines that the best interests of the city will be served by terminating the suspension of the requirement to obtain a master permit. The suspension of any master permit required hereunder shall not constitute a consent or permission by the city to occupy the public right-of-way by the operator for any use, nor shall it be construed as a waiver of any right of the city to require the operator to hereafter at any time obtain a master permit or to remove any or all of its facilities in the public right-of-way at any time upon its failure to obtain a master permit. In the event an operator fails to obtain a master permit as herein requested and the master permit requirement is suspended as herein provided then the operator shall be required to apply for a city ROW permit prior to constructing or placing any wireline telecommunication facility in the public right-of-way.

D.    Nature of Grant. Neither a master permit nor a license shall convey title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. The right granted is only the right to occupy those portions of the public rights-of-way to which the city has the right to grant access, for the purposes and for the period stated in the master permit or license, and, subject to the limitations in this section and elsewhere in this title, the right may not be subdivided or subleased. A master permit, ROW permit or license shall not grant a vested right for any facility to be located or to remain at any specific location in the public right-of-way and any right, permission or consent to occupy any location in the public right-of-way shall be revocable and terminable at the discretion of the city and the facility therein removed at the cost of the operator in order to allow free and unencumbered use of the public right-of-way for public work or other public purpose as may be in the best public or municipal interest as determined by the city.

Every master permit shall be:

1.    Deemed to include all of the provisions that are required to be in a master permit under this title, as if fully set forth in the master permit.

2.    Deemed to provide for forfeiture under the circumstances set forth in the provisions of this title and any master permit hereunder; and

3.    Construed to exclude the grant of any rights in any easement granted for or in favor of any city or public utility facilities or operations, unless the master permit or license shall expressly state otherwise.

No reference herein, or in any master permit, ROW permit or license, to a public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a master permit shall be deemed to grant no more than those rights which the city may have the undisputed right and power to give. (Ord. 2001-21 (part), 2001)


11.04.050 General conditions upon use of public rights-of-way.

A.    Responsibility for Costs. Except as expressly provided otherwise, any act that a communications system operator, its contractors or subcontractors are required to perform under this section shall be performed at their cost. If a communications system operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance, the city may perform the work and bill the communications system operator therefore. The communications system operator shall pay the amounts billed within thirty days.

B.    Construction Procedures and Placement of Facilities; Obligation to Minimize Interference With Use of Public Rights-of-Way.

1.    The construction, operation, and repair of communications facilities are subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the city that have jurisdiction in such matters and shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and practices affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning codes and safety codes and current city standards, including the most current version of the standard specifications for road, bridge and municipal construction, as prepared by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Washington State chapter of American Public Works Association (APWA), the most current version of the APWA Amendments to Division One, and the most current version of the city of Poulsbo amendments thereto. In addition, the construction, operation, and repair shall be performed in a manner consistent with high industry standards. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property.

2.    Construction, operation, or repair of a communications system shall not commence until all required permits have been properly filed for and obtained from the proper city officials and all required permits and associated fees paid. In any permit so issued, the city may impose as a condition of the granting of the permit such conditions and regulations as may be necessary to the management of the rights-of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way, for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection of the city and the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. A master permit, license or ROW permit or other applicable provision of this code may provide for the conditions under which certain emergency work may be undertaken prior to obtaining certain permits where such work is necessary to immediately remedy an emergency situation involving an imminent danger to health, safety or property or to temporarily restore communication system services which have been disrupted by storms, earthquakes, riots or other unexpected accidents or phenomenon; provided, however, that the communication system operator undertaking such emergency work shall be required: (a) to give notice to the city of the commencement of the emergency work as quickly as practical; (b) to apply for the permits which would otherwise be required for such work by the next business day from the commencement of such work; and (c) to conform any work performed prior to the approval of the required permit and to carry out any other work in the area involved in accordance with the requirements of the permit. Subcontractors are prohibited from liening public property or any facilities placed in the public right-of-way.

3.    Operators of communications systems must follow city-established requirements for placement of facilities in public rights-of-way, including the specific location of facilities in the public rights-of-way, and must in any event install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing communications facilities. The city may require that facilities be installed at a particular time, at a specific place, or in a particular manner as a condition of access to a particular right-of-way; may deny access if an operator is not willing to comply with the city’s requirements; and may remove, or require removal of any facility that is not installed in compliance with the requirements established by the city, or which is installed without prior city approval of the time, place, or manner of installation and charge the operator of the facility for all the costs associated with removal; and may require a person using the rights-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on the rights-of-way through joint trenching, joint use of facilities and other arrangements:

4.    Upon order of the city engineer, all work which does not comply with the permit, the approved plans or specifications for the work, or the requirements of this title or other applicable law shall be removed.

5.    Unless otherwise agreed or provided in a master permit, license or ROW permit, a communication systems operator shall be required to reimburse and hold harmless the city for any cost or expense reasonably incurred by the city in the planning, construction, installing, altering, or implementing any public work as a result of the construction or the presence in the public right-of-way of the facility of such communication system operator.

6.    No new poles or extenders on poles to increase capacity shall be allowed in the public rights-of-way and all new overhead facilities of any nature are prohibited unless specifically allowed under this chapter or other applicable provisions of this code or applicable city policies, procedures and current standards.

7.    The specific location within the right-of-way and the method of installing facilities underground or overhead will be subject to approval by the city engineer. Cutting of pavement in the public right-of-way shall be prohibited where the city engineer approves locating underground facilities in the unimproved portions of the right-of-way or in the sidewalk areas or requires alternative methods for undergrounding not requiring trenching or the cutting of pavement.

8.    Cutting of pavement shall be prohibited in any event in a newly constructed or reconstructed street for a period of ten years from the paving of such street or in a street where a trench was previously available for a period of three years from the date the trench was available. The city may require as a condition to the occupancy of the rights-of-way that communication facilities be located within existing underground ducts or conduits wherever the capacity exists. Provided, however, the city engineer may in his or her discretion permit pot-holing (subject to conditions to alleviate the harmful effects) where conduit is to be placed underground by means of directional boring and the person seeking permission has provided evidence satisfactory to the public works director/city engineer that: (a) such pot-holing is necessary to avoid interference with existing utilities; (b) such pot-holing is the only reasonable alternative available to locate existing utilities; and (c) such pot-holing will result in little or no visual or other detrimental impact to the street.

9.    Any and all public rights-of-way, public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation, repair or removal of a communications facility shall be promptly repaired by the communications system operator that disturbed or damaged the public rights-of-way, public property or private property. Public property and public right-of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of the city and to a condition as good or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred. A communication system operator shall continue to maintain the restored street area, which may consist of curb, gutter, sidewalk, pavement, or other restored appurtenances, in a condition as good as or better than the condition of the adjacent undisturbed area of the street for the life of the street (to the extent such maintenance or restoration is required: (a) as a result of the restored street area being defective or otherwise inferior to the adjacent undisturbed area of the street, or (b) as a result of the presence of the facilities of the communication system operator), until the restored area is repaved or reconstructed by a different party, except when such repaving or reconstruction is a result of enforcement action by the city for the lack of such maintenance activity; unless: (a) the assessment of the impact assessment under this title provides for an exemption, or (b) a master permit, license or permit specifically exempts the communication system operator from such obligation.

10.    No tree trimming shall be performed without the permission of the city and other affected authorities, and tree trimming must be performed in strict accordance with this code.

11.    Within five calendar days after notice from the city, a communications system operator shall remove any graffiti on any part of its communications system in the public rights-of-way (including by way of example and not limitation equipment cabinets). If the operator fails to do so, the city may remove the graffiti and bill the operator for the cost thereof.

C.    Relocation and Abandonment of Facilities.

1.    A communications system operator shall, by a time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade, construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work, public facility or improvement, or any government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the communications facility. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the “public work.”

(a)    Except in the case of emergencies, the city shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed as soon as practical but at least thirty days prior to the deadline by which a communications system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. A communications system operator may seek an extension of the time to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in thirty days or by the completion time specified even with the exercise of its best efforts, and such request for an extension shall not be unreasonably refused.

(b)    In the event of an emergency, or where a communications facility creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the communications facility without prior notice, and charge the communications system operator for costs incurred.

(c)    If a communications system operator does not comply with the requirements of this title and the applicable master permit, license or ROW permit does not provide otherwise and if not prohibited by applicable law, the city shall have the right to revoke any right of a communications system operator to have its facilities remain at a specific location in the public right-of-way at any time the city determines that the facilities of such communications system operator must be removed from their present location or from the street in order to facilitate a public work in the public right-of-way and upon such revocation of the master permit, license or ROW permit of the communications system operator as to the affected designated facilities the communications system operator shall remove the same and restore the street at its cost.

2.    If any person that is authorized to place facilities in the rights-of-way requests another communications system operator receiving the request to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate its facilities to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of such other person, the communications system operator shall, after thirty days’ advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract or a state or federal law or regulation, or unless the communications facility that is being requested to move was not properly installed, the reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the person requesting the protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal, or relocation and at no charge to the city, even if the city makes the request for such action.

3.    A communications system operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same. A communications system operator shall be given not less than thirty days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.

4.    Grantee may abandon and surrender its master permit to the city upon six months written notice to the city engineer, with copies thereof served upon the mayor and city attorney. Abandonment shall be subject to acceptance by the city, by a resolution of acceptance adopted by the city council. Upon abandonment, non-renewal, revocation or expiration of this master permit, and if no extension is granted, grantee may, at the discretion of the city engineer, be required in part or entirely, to remove all its fiber, wire, poles, fixtures, and other facilities or equipment installed or used in the enjoyment of the master permit. Alternatively, the city engineer may direct, limit or condition grantee’s removal, sale or continued use or abandonment of grantee’s facilities and equipment, either by agreement or through means of any other lawful municipal power or right. The city may continue to invoke any provision of this master permit against grantee or any successor entity enjoying de facto master permit privileges after revocation or expiration. The city may take all other actions deemed necessary and proper by the city to accommodate the transition to any successor as may be in the best interests of the city and its residents.

D.    Facility Subject to Inspection; Operator Must Provide Information. Every communications facility shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection by the city to determine compliance with the provisions of this title, a master permit or license agreement, or other applicable law. The city shall have the right, upon request, to be notified and present when the communications system is inspected by the operator to determine compliance with the provisions of this title; a master permit, license or ROW permit; or applicable law where the city has enforcement authority. Each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated, or repaired to the extent such plant is or will be in the public right-of-way or has been or will be provided under any master permit, license or ROW permit granted by or requested from the city.

E.    Underground Services Alert. Each operator of a communications system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The operator shall locate its facilities for the city at no charge. Grantee promises to reasonably cooperate with city initiatives to coordinate underground fixture locations and installations. Grantee is familiar with Chapter 19.122 RCW, Washington State’s “Underground Utilities” statute. Grantee certifies it understands local procedures, custom and practice relating to facilities locating, and will see to it that its contractors or others working in the right-of-way on grantee’s behalf are similarly well informed.

F.    Undergrounding of Lines. The grantee recognizes the city’s right to preserve and control the public right-of-way, particularly with respect to policies regarding the undergrounding of overhead lines for aesthetic reasons. Consistent with any general municipal undergrounding policy or program now or hereafter developed, the city reserves the right to require grantee’s participation in municipally imposed undergrounding or related requirements as may now or hereafter arise, as a condition of grantee’s new installation or major maintenance or restoration construction activities of overhead facilities under this franchise. Grantee agrees to coordinate its underground installation and planning activities with the city’s underground plan and policies; provided, in no event shall any third party beneficiary rights be implied or created. Nothing in this section shall be permitted in conflict with RCW 35.99.060, and the provisions of this section shall be applied in conformity thereto.

G.    Plans For and Publicizing Work.

1.    Work shall be publicized as the city may direct from time to time. The publication of work may be used to notify the public and operators of other communications systems, of the impending work, in order to minimize inconvenience and disruption to the public and to allow joint use by others.

2.    Each communications system owner shall provide the city a plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the city that will be affected.

3.    Grantee promises to supply and maintain updated, at no cost, any information requested by the city engineer to coordinate municipal functions with grantee’s activities and fulfill any municipal obligations under state law. Said information may include an installation inventory, location of existing or planned facilities, maps, plans, and as-built drawings of grantee’s installations within the city. Said information may be requested either in hard copy and/or electronic format compatible with the city’s database system, as now or hereafter existing. Grantee shall keep the city engineer informed of its long-range plans for coordination with the city’s long-range plans.

4.    Each communications facility operator shall maintain accurate maps and improvements plans which show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities installed in the public rights-of-way and any power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon post-construction inspection to verify location. The operator of each communications facility shall provide a map (on twenty-four-inch by thirty-six-inch mylar) to the city showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be directed by the city engineer. New system maps shall be promptly submitted to the city when the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk, in a commercially available electronic format specified by the city engineer, or in such alternate form as approved by the city engineer.

5.    The city engineer may from time to time, when the city receives application for a permit to use a particular route, or upon the city engineer’s own initiative, designate by published order a route or proposed route for installation of communications facilities and may: (1) require all persons who wish to place underground facilities along that route or any part thereof to install them during a specified period, and (2) otherwise prohibit placement of such facilities along the route or any part thereof for thirty-six months or for such other, longer period as is necessary to protect the public. (Ord. 2001-21 (part), 2001)


11.04.060 Taxes and fees.

A.    No franchise fee shall be charged to the grantee for its operation of telecommunications facilities in the right-of-way, whether as a lessor of the facilities to third parties or as a direct provider of telecommunications services. Nothing in this master permit shall limit the city’s power of taxation, as may now or hereafter exist.

B.    Consistent with RCW 35.21.860(1)(b), nothing in this master permit shall prohibit the city from charging a fee to recover the actual administrative expenses it incurs that are directly related to receiving and approving a master permit, license, and ROW permit, to inspecting plans and construction, or to the preparation of a detailed statement pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW. Upon request of grantee, the city will submit proof of any charges or expenses incurred. For any project or time frame, grantee can also request a written estimate from the city engineer, in advance of costs planned to be expended by the city, and grantee may object to any costs as provided hereafter in the case of a challenged cost billed by the city. Except as otherwise provided, said fees must be paid within thirty days of receipt of the city’s billing. Grantee will pay all other taxes applicable to its operations or activities within the city of Poulsbo, all such obligations also being a condition of this master permit. Fees/charges for administrative expenses related to receiving a master permit and/or license shall be as set forth in Section 3.12.020(J) and may be revised from time to time as set forth in Section 3.12.010(B). Fees for public property construction permits shall be as set forth in Section 3.12.020(B).

C.    Grantee shall make any required payments in the form, intervals and manner requested by the city engineer, and furnish him/her any information related to his/her revenue collection functions reasonably requested. In case of audit, the finance director may require grantee to furnish a verified statement of compliance with grantee’s obligations or in response to any questions, verified by an officer of the grantee. All audits will take place on grantee’s premises or offices furnished by grantee, which shall be a location within the city. Grantee agrees, upon request of the finance director, to provide copies of all documents filed with any federal, state, or local regulatory agency, to be mailed to the finance director on the same day as filed, postage prepaid, affecting any of grantee’s facilities or business operations in the state of Washington. (Ord. 2003-33 § 2, 2003; Ord. 2003-16 § 26, 2003; Ord. 2001-21 (part), 2001)


11.04.070 Protection of the city and residents.

A.    Indemnification. No master permit or other authorization to use the rights-of-way issued to a communications system operator or a private communications system owner shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from such operator. Unless otherwise agreed, in writing, adequate indemnity must at least include the following:

1.    Release the city from and against any and all liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the communications facility in the public right-of-way by the communications facility operator. Each communications facility operator must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from city in connection with the above-mentioned matters.

2.    Indemnify and hold harmless the city, its trustees, elected and appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys’ fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees, sustained by the city or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the acts, errors, or omissions of the communications system operator, or its agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the facility in the public rights-of-way.

3.    Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the indemnification provision shall survive the term of any master permit or other authorization and continue in full force and effect as to the party’s responsibility to indemnify.

B.    Insurance. No master permit or other authorization to use the rights-of-way issued to a communications system operator or a private communications system owner shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains assurance that such operator (and those acting on its behalf) have adequate insurance. Unless otherwise agreed, in writing, adequate insurance must at least meet the following requirements:

1.    A communications system operator shall not commence construction or operation of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this paragraph and approval of such insurance by the city, nor shall a communications system operator allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the communications system operator has facilities in the rights-of-way, and for a period thereafter as specified in the minimum coverages described below. If the operator, its contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved.

2.    Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance and naming the city as an additional insured, shall be filed with the city clerk. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the rights-of-way as of the effective date of this title, the certificate shall be filed within sixty days of the effective date of this title, annually thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage, unless a pre-existing master permit provides for filing of certificates in a different manner.

3.    These certificates shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least thirty days’ prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state of Washington. Financial ratings must be no less than “A” in the latest edition of “Best’s Key Rating Guide,” published by A.M. Best Guide.

4.    In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the period of the master permit or license, then in that event, the communications system operator shall furnish, at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage has been or will be obtained prior to any such lapse or termination during the balance of the period of the master permit or license under which the communications system operates.

5.    A communications system owner or operator, and its contractors or subcontractors engaged in work on the operator’s behalf in, on, under or over public rights-of-way, shall maintain the following minimum insurance. The city shall be named as an additional insured on the general liability and automotive policies.

(a)    Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability bodily injury and property damage. Exposures to be covered are: premises, operations, products/completed operations, and certain contracts. Coverage must be written on an occurrence basis, with the following limits of liability:

(v)    Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for the following hazards: X—Explosion, C—Collapse, U—Underground.

(b)    Workers’ compensation insurance shall be maintained during the life of this contract to comply with statutory limits for all employees, and in the case any work is sublet, each communications system operator shall require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers’ compensation insurance for all the latter’s employees unless such employees are covered by the protection afforded by each communications system operator. Each communications system operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy employers liability insurance. The following minimum limits must be maintained:

	(i)	Worker’s Compensation Statutory

	(ii)	Employer’s liability	$500,000 per occurrence

6.    Each communications system operator shall hold the city, its agents, and employees harmless on account of claims for damages to persons, property or premises arising out of its construction, operation or repair of its communications system and name the city as an additional insured.

7.    In every master permit or license agreement, the city shall reserve the right to require any other insurance coverage it deems necessary depending upon the exposures.

C.    Performance/Payment Bonds.

The amount of the performance and payment bonds shall be set by the city engineer or may be set in a master permit in light of the nature of the work to be performed and is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney. The city may from time to time increase or decrease the amount of the required performance bond to reflect changes in risks to the city and to the public. (Ord. 2001-21 (part), 2001)


11.04.080 Enforcement and remedies.

A.    City Engineer Responsible for Administration. The city engineer is responsible for enforcing and administering this title, and the city engineer is authorized to give any notice required by law or under any master permit including, by way of example and not limitation, a notice required under 47 U.S.C. § 546. The city engineer is also authorized to seek information from any communications system operator, and to take all other actions necessary or appropriate to the administration of this title or any master permit. Master permits may only be denied, issued or revoked by action of the city council.

B.    Minimum Contents of Every Master Permit or License. In addition to satisfying the other applicable requirements of this chapter, every master permit or license for a communications system shall contain the following provisions:

1.    The master permit or license shall provide that neither the granting of any master permit or license, nor any provision thereof, shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police power, or regulatory power of the city as may exist at the time the master permit or license is issued or thereafter be obtained.

2.    The master permit or license shall only authorize occupancy of the right-of-way to provide the services and for the purposes described in the master permit or license.

3.    A master permit or license shall be a privilege that is held in the public trust and personal to the original grantee. The master permit or license shall ensure that no transfer of the master permit or license may occur, directly or indirectly, without the prior consent of the city.

4.    The master permit or license shall contain appropriate provisions for enforcement, and protection of the public, consistent with the other provisions of this title.

5.    The master permit or license shall be for a specified term, set forth in the master permit or license. No master permit issued under this title shall be for a term of longer than ten years, unless the council determines that a longer period would be in the city’s interest. No license issued under this title shall be for a term of longer than five years.

C.    Penalties. Any person found to have occupied or carried out activities in the public rights-of-way without first having obtained or having in effect a valid master permit, license, or ROW permit as required by this title shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding ninety days or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day that any such occupancy or activity shall continue in violation of this title shall constitute a separate offense.

D.    Revocation, Reduction of Term, or Forfeiture of Master Permit or License.

1.    Licenses shall be revocable at will.

2.    This master permit may be revoked for violation of any terms and conditions of the master permit or other city ordinances, resolutions or policy including but not limited to the following.

(a)    Construction or operation in the public rights-of-way of the city or upon city property in a manner in violation of this master permit;

(b)    Construction or operation at an unauthorized location in the public rights-of way of the city or upon city property;

(c)    Misrepresentation by or on behalf of grantee in any material respect in any application or written statements or documents to the city upon which the city relies in making the decision to grant, review, or amend this master permit.

(d)    Abandonment of telecommunications facilities in the public ways or upon city property;

(e)    Failure to relocate or remove facilities as required by this title or master permit;

(f)    Failure to pay taxes, compensation, fees, or costs when and as due the city under this title;

(g)    Insolvency or bankruptcy of grantee;

(h)    Violation of any material provision of this title or master permit, which is not timely, cured upon notice to grantee by the city.

3.    In the event that the city believes that grounds exist for revocation of the master permit, grantee shall be given written notice of the apparent violation or noncompliance, which notice shall provide the grantee a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty days to finish evidence:

a.    That corrective action has been, or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance; 

b.    That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; or 

c.    That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or sanction 1ess than revocation.

4.    In the event that grantee fails to provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to the city engineer, the city engineer shall refer the apparent violation or non-compliance to the city council. The city council shall provide the grantee with reasonable notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard concerning the matter.

5.    General administration of this master permit for the city is through the office of the city engineer. However, the city engineer may delegate his/her authority and responsibility to other agents of the city. All questions of application, interpretation, conflict or ambiguity arising out of or in connection with this master permit may be determined through communications with the city engineer, except where otherwise specifically stated.

6.    Grantee may appeal any decision of the city engineer to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal within thirty days of the date of issuance of the city engineer’s decision, with copies also sent to the mayor, city engineer and city attorney. The notice of appeal must include a copy of the city engineer’s decision and a complete record originally submitted to the city engineer by grantee. The city engineer shall submit any additional response to the city council within ten days of receipt of the notice of appeal. The city council shall schedule a hearing within a reasonable period of time but not to exceed sixty days from filing of the notice of appeal and decide the question submitted. No opportunity to cure is allowed for fraud, which shall be deemed incurable.

7.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may declare a master permit forfeited without opportunity to cure or the notice required by Section 3 where the grantee fails to begin to exercise its rights under the master permit within a period specified in the master permit. However, a grantee shall have the right to receive thirty days prior notice of intent to declare a master permit forfeited, and shall have the opportunity to show cause why the master permit should not be forfeited.

8.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a master permit or license will automatically terminate by force of law one hundred twenty calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the grantee or licensee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. However, the master permit or license may be reinstated within that one hundred twenty day period, if: (1) such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or (2) such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this title and the master permit or license and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this title and the master permit or license. However, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a grantee or licensee, the city may revoke the master permit or license, following a public hearing before the city council, by serving notice upon the grantee or licensee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the master permit or license and all rights and privileges of the master permit or license will be revoked and will terminate thirty calendar days after serving such notice, unless: (1) the city has approved the transfer of the master permit or license to the successful bidder; and (2) the successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the master permit or license and this title.

E.    Sale, Lease, Assignment.

1.    This master permit or license shall not be sold, leased, assigned, or otherwise alienated without the express consent of the city, and no rule of estoppel shall be invoked against the city in case the city shall assert the invalidity of any attempted transfer in violation of this section. The city agrees not to withhold consent where grantee demonstrates that the requested assignment is in the nature of a change of name or a change in the nature of a reorganization or merger of or with an entity controlled by, controlling, or under the common control of the grantee, there being no other change in the resulting entity’s ability to meet its master permit or license obligations.

2.    The city reserves the right to invoke any or all provisions of this master permit or license upon the grantee’s successors or assigns, judgment creditors, or distributee of facilities or property used in enjoyment of privileges conferred herein, whether or not stated elsewhere, all without waiver of the right to withhold consent not expressly given of any such transfer and/or require a new master permit or license.

3.    Grantee will not permit installations by others in the permitted areas without written approval from the city engineer. Such approval shall not be in lieu of a master permit or license or other requirements of the city. Whether or not permitted, grantee remains responsible for all third party users permitted or allowed by grantee for compliance with this master permit or license. The intent of this provision is so third parties who might otherwise desire to use grantee’s facilities are also required to comply with city requirements regarding master permit or license, as may apply.

F.    Effect of Termination or Forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a license or master permit, whether by action of the city as provided above, or by passage of time, the grantee or licensee shall be obligated to cease using the communications system for the purposes authorized by the master permit. The city may either take possession of some or all of the licensee’s or grantee’s facilities in the public rights-of-way or require the licensee or grantee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the licensee’s or grantee’s facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to its same, or better, condition. Should the grantee or licensee neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the city may remove the facility at the expense of the grantee or licensee. The obligation of the licensee or grantee to remove shall survive the termination of the master permit or license for a period of two years; provided, that this provision does not permit the city to take possession of; or require the grantee or licensee to remove, any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the grantee holds a valid master permit or license issued by the city.

G.    Remedies Cumulative. All remedies under this title and any master permit or license are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a communications system operator of its obligations to comply with its master permit or license. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in addition, the city may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, or otherwise, does not limit a communications system operator’s duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a communications system operator of its obligations under a master permit, ROW permit or license, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have.

H.    Compliance with Laws. Each grantee and licensee shall comply with all applicable laws heretofore and hereafter adopted or established during the entire term of its master permit, permit or license.

I.    Reservation of Authority. The city may do all things that are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this title.

J.    Title Not a Contract The city expressly reserves the right to amend this title and any master permit, ROW permit or License hereunder from time to time in the exercise of its lawful powers. The provisions of this title shall not be construed to create to be a contract.

K    No Waiver. The failure of the city to insist on timely performance or compliance by any person holding a license, ROW permit or master permit shall not constitute a waiver of the city’s right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person or any other person holding such a license, ROW permit or master permit.

The failure of the city to enforce any provision of this title on any occasion shall not operate as a waiver or estoppel of this right to enforce any provision of this title on any other occasion, nor shall the failure to enforce any prior ordinance, law or contractual provision affecting communications facilities or communications system operators act as a waiver or estoppel against application of this title or any other provision of applicable law. (Ord. 2001-21 (part), 2001)

12.02.030    Stormwater design manual adoption.

*    Prior ordinance history: Ords. 84-34, 88-01, 89-21, 90-11 and 90-17.


12.02.010 Construction and development standards.

A.    The city engineer shall administratively adopt design and construction standards that shall apply to all new construction or reconstruction. At a minimum, the city engineer shall adopt the latest edition of the following:

1.    City of Poulsbo Standards and Specifications, published by the city of Poulsbo;

2.    Recommended Guidelines for Subdivision Streets, published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers;

3.    Criteria for Sewage Works Design, published by the Washington State Department of Ecology;

4.    The Low Impact Development Guidance Manual, a Practical Guide to LID Implementation in Kitsap County, published by the Kitsap Home Builders Foundation;

5.    Design Manual, published by the Washington State Department of Transportation;

6.    Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction, published by the Washington State Department of Transportation;

7.    Standard Specifications for Municipal Public Works Construction, published by the American Public Works Association;

8.    AWWA Standards, published by the American Water Works Association.

B.    The city engineer’s adoption and amendment of a list of applicable design and construction standards shall be in writing and shall be filed in the office of the city engineer. All such design and construction standards shall be either professionally or nationally recognized or shall have been previously adopted by the city of Poulsbo. The city engineer shall amend the list of standards adopted as needed to reflect the issuance of updated standards and to ensure that the standards used by the city of Poulsbo are the most current and the best suited to serve the public interest.

C.    In the case of any conflict between the standards adopted by the city engineer pursuant to subsection A of this section, the more restrictive standard shall apply as determined by the city engineer.

D.    All construction and reconstruction shall comply with the standards identified in subsection A of this section, unless variations or exemption to these requirements have been specifically approved by the city council. Variations or exemptions shall be granted only if the council finds that the variation or exemption results in a development which substantially complies with the purposes of the city’s adopted development standards and poses no significant risk to the public health, safety and welfare.

E.    The standards that are identified in this section are not to be construed as limiting the authority of the city of Poulsbo and its officials granted by any other ordinance, statutory provision or other law. The city of Poulsbo and its officials retain the authority to apply any design or construction standards not adopted by the city engineer if otherwise authorized to do so. (Ord. 2010-04 § 1, 2010; Ord. 96-08 § 1, 1996)


12.02.015 Conduit standards.

A.    Legislative Findings. The Poulsbo city council finds that:

1.    Demand for access to high-speed telecommunications services is growing. In order to fill such demand, telecommunications service providers install telecommunication lines in public rights-of-way.

2.    In other jurisdictions, the demand for access and the number of telecommunications service providers has sometimes resulted in multiple, serial excavations within the public rights-of-way. Each such excavation can and does result in traffic disruption, a weakening of pavement integrity, and a shortening of the useful life of paved surfaces.

3.    The city of Poulsbo has not experienced a high demand for use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications service providers, but in order to responsibly manage its public rights-of-way the city should anticipate such demand in the future and plan accordingly.

4.    Requiring that conduit be installed in newly constructed public streets and rights-of-way in order to accommodate the anticipated future demand for access to telecommunications services will assist the city in responsibly managing its public rights-of-way by:

a.    Reducing or eliminating the need for excavation within public streets and rights-of-way when telecommunications service providers seek to locate underground telecommunications facilities within such streets and rights-of-way in the future;

b.    Reduce or eliminate the traffic disruption that occurs whenever excavation occurs within streets and public rights-of-way;

c.    Reduce or eliminate the loss of pavement integrity and diminishment of the useful life of pavement that occurs whenever paved streets and rights-of-way are cut and excavated within; and

d.    Meet the needs and desires of the public for access to high-speed telecommunications services and the needs and desires of telecommunications service providers to locate within the public streets and rights-of-way.

5.    In residential areas, anticipated demand for the reasonable future can likely be met by the capacity provided by two telecommunication lines. In non-residential areas, anticipated demand is higher, but can likely be met for the reasonable future by the capacity provided by four telecommunication lines. Requiring the installation of conduit and other facilities necessary to support these lines will allow anticipated needs to be met while allowing the city to responsibly manage its rights-of-way.

B.    Intent. The intent of this section is to provide for the construction of infrastructure sufficient to allow telecommunications service providers desiring to deploy communication lines in the future to do so by pulling the same through the conduit and appurtenances installed pursuant to this section and without excavating within the right-of-way. This section is not intended to require telecommunications service providers to install additional ducts or conduit pursuant the provisions of RCW 35.99.070, but is intended to require those constructing public streets, including the city and private developers, to provide and install such conduit and appurtenances as may be necessary to accommodate future telecommunications needs within public streets and rights-of-way without further excavation or disturbance.

C.    Requirements—Adoption of Standards. Whenever any new public street is constructed, whether by the city as a public works project or by a private party in conjunction with development, the following shall be required:

1.    In all new local access public streets serving or abutting residential development, a conduit of a sufficient diameter and containing interducts of sufficient number and diameter to accommodate a minimum of two telecommunication lines shall be installed by the party constructing the street.

2.    In all new collector or arterial public streets serving or abutting residential development, and in all new public streets serving or abutting nonresidential development, a conduit of a sufficient diameter and containing interducts of sufficient number and diameter to accommodate a minimum of four telecommunication lines shall be installed by the party constructing the street.

3.    In addition to installing conduit, the party constructing the street will be required to install such vaults and other appurtenances as may be necessary to accommodate installation and connection of telecommunication lines within the conduit.

4.    All construction and installation shall be accomplished according to construction standards adopted by the city engineer. The construction standards shall be adopted with due consideration given to existing and anticipated technologies and industry standards. The construction standards shall specify the minimum diameter of the conduit and interducts and the minimum number of interducts to meet the requirements of this section.

5.    All conduit and appurtenances installed by private parties pursuant to this section shall be conveyed and dedicated to the city with the dedication and conveyance of the public street and/or right-of-way.

6.    Any and all installation costs shall be the responsibility of the party constructing the public street.

D.    Use by Telecommunications Service Providers. Whenever conduit installed or to be installed under this section is available or will become available within a newly constructed public streets or right-of-way upon dedication, all telecommunications service providers thereafter locating telecommunication lines within such street or right-of-way shall be required to locate their communication lines within such conduit unless it can be demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the city engineer that such location is not technologically feasible or reasonably practicable. Conduit capacity shall be allocated to telecommunications service providers on a first-come, first-served basis; provided, that the city may reserve capacity within such conduits for its own use; and provided further, that the city engineer may adopt additional rules for conduit allocation in order to ensure that all telecommunications service providers have reasonable access to the city’s rights-of-way and that no barriers to entry or competition result from the allocation of conduit space.

E.    Fees. The city reserves the right to charge reasonable fees for the use of conduit installed pursuant to this section, to the extent consistent with and as limited by federal and state laws and regulations. Any such fees shall be established by resolution or ordinance. (Ord. 2003-25 § 1, 2003)


12.02.020 Compliance.

All new construction or reconstruction shall comply with these standards, unless a variation or exemption to these requirements is specifically recommended in writing by the responsible city official and approved by the city council. Construction of or other adequate provision for such infrastructures, such as agreement to participate in an LID, is a prerequisite to the development, construction or reconstruction of any property, whether by building permit, subdivision or other form of development approval. (Ord. 93-32 § 1, 1993: Ord. 91-01 § 2 (part), 1991)


12.02.030 Stormwater design manual adoption.

The city of Poulsbo hereby adopts the following stormwater design and guidance manuals for all new development, redevelopment and construction projects within the city of Poulsbo subject to the minimum requirements, technical thresholds and definitions contained within the manuals as adopted in this section:

A.    The Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington (SWMMWW) published by Department of Ecology, and as amended in 2014.

B.    Low Impact Development: Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound, December 2012.

C.    The Washington State Department of Transportation Highway Runoff Manual, as determined by the Washington State Department of Ecology to be equivalent to the 2014 Department of Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, may be used when required by state or federal funding requirements. (Ord. 2016-20 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 2010-02 § 1 (part), 2010)

All proposals for new subdivisions, including short and long plats, rezones, shoreline permits and site plan approvals shall, as a condition of approval, include the construction and installation of sidewalks, curbs, gutters and drainage. Such improvements shall be constructed and installed according to city specifications prior to the first occupancy permit being issued for the project. When, in the opinion of the city council, increased pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic will be generated by the project, the city council may require off-site installation of sidewalks, curbs, gutters and drainage. (Ord. 83-43 § 1, 1983)


12.04.020 Installation.

A.    Whenever, in the judgment of the city council, a sidewalk system is required for pedestrian safety along any existing city street, the city council may, by resolution pursuant to Chapter 35.68 RCW, direct that the sidewalk, together with curbing, gutter and drainage facilities, be constructed and installed within a time frame specified by the city council, with such construction and installation to be done by the owners of property abutting the improvement at the owner’s cost and expense, or may cause the improvements to be constructed and installed and assess all or any portion of the cost thereof against abutting property owners.

B.    When property owners are required to construct the improvements, physical location and grade of the sidewalk system shall be specified by the city engineer at no cost to the property owners, unless otherwise specifically agreed prior to construction of the improvements.

C.    This section is intended to apply to streets and developments existing at the time sidewalk system installation is required. Installation of sidewalks in conjunction with new development shall be governed by Section 12.04.010. (Ord. 89-36 § 2, 1989: Ord. 83-43 § 2, 1983)


12.04.030 Curb cuts—Approval of city engineer.

No person shall begin work on the construction, alteration, repair or removal of any driveway or the paving of any parking strip on or adjacent to any street, alley or other public place in the city, without first obtaining approval of the city engineer. All construction, alteration, repairs or removal of driveways shall be accomplished in accordance with city specifications. (Ord. 83-43 § 3(A), 1983)

A.    No driveway shall be so located as to create a hazard to pedestrians, bicyclists or motorists or invite or compel illegal or unsafe traffic movements.

B.    Unless otherwise approved by the city engineer, all driveways including the returns shall be confined within lines perpendicular to the curbline and passing through the property corners, except no driveway curb cut shall be closer than thirty feet from an intersecting street corner unless, due to property configuration, a special waiver in writing is granted by the city engineer.

C.    No driveway shall be constructed in such a manner as to be a hazard to any existing street lighting standard, utility pole, traffic regulating device or fire hydrant. The cost of relocating any such street structure when necessary to do so shall be paid by the abutting property owner. The relocation of any street structure shall be allowed only on approval of the person owning the structure involved.

D.    On private property every driveway must provide access to parking structures or access specifically designated for parking or purposes requiring the entrance of vehicles. (Ord. 83-43 § 3(B), 1983)


12.04.050 Curb cuts—Size and number.

A.    Except as otherwise provided, the width of any residential driveway shall not exceed twenty feet, exclusive of the radii of the returns. (The measurement being made parallel to the centerline of the street.) The maximum width for any commercial driveway is thirty feet. The city engineer may authorize additional driveways for ingress and egress necessary for off-street parking and safe entrance or exit to a city street.

B.    The width of any driveway shall not be less than ten feet, exclusive of the radii of the returns, the measurement being made perpendicular to the centerline of the driveway.

C.    The total width of all driveways for any one ownership on a street shall not exceed fifty percent of the frontage of that ownership along the street. Any driveway which has become abandoned or unused through a change of the conditions for which it was originally intended, or which for any other reason has become unnecessary, shall be closed and the owner shall replace any such driveway curb cut with a standard curb to be constructed according to the city’s specifications.

D.    There shall not be more than two driveways on one street for any one ownership, except where a single ownership is developed into more than one unit of operation, each insufficient in itself to meet the requirements of off-street parking and loading and where the necessity for separate access to the street is evident. In such cases there shall be not more than two driveways on the street for any one unit of operation. (Ord. 83-43 § 3(C), 1983)


12.04.060 Maintenance of adjacent areas.

The owner of property adjacent to a street shall maintain the sidewalk system and planting strip as follows:

The surety agreement will also guarantee the repair or replacement of any improvement or restoration work done under the permit which proves defective in workmanship or materials within a period of one or two years from completion of the work and approval of the same by the city, the actual period of the guarantee to be set by the city engineer based upon the nature and complexity of the work involved. The surety agreement will also insure the applicant’s submission, pursuant to Section 12.08.060, of a completed set of engineer certified “as-built” plans at the completion of the job to the satisfaction of the city engineer. The surety agreement shall take one of the following forms:

1.    A cash deposit made pursuant to the city’s official cash deposit agreement form as approved by the city attorney, in an amount determined by the city engineer to be sufficient to guarantee performance and maintenance as set forth above; or

2.    A surety bond on the city’s official construction bond form as approved by the city attorney and in an amount determined by the city engineer to be sufficient to guarantee performance and maintenance as set forth in this section.

B.    In addition to the surety agreement required under subsection A of this section, the applicant shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect throughout the period of construction and the maintenance guarantee period prescribed by the city engineer, a general liability insurance policy written on an occurrence basis with limits to be set by the city engineer based on the complexity and scope of the work involved. Such policies shall name the city as an additional insured and shall contain a provision preventing cancellation except upon thirty days’ advance written notice to the city. Proof of such insurance shall be furnished to the city prior to the issuance of any permit.

C.    Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the city engineer determines that the construction involved will require minimal use of city property and not pose any significant risk of liability or injury to persons or property, the city engineer may do one or both of the following:

1.    Waive the requirement for the filing of a surety agreement as provided in subsection A of this section and accept a performance and maintenance agreement in a form approved by the city attorney under which the applicant agrees to complete the work as required by the city engineer and guarantees the repair, replacement, or restoration within a time period determined by the city engineer; and/or

2.    Accept an indemnity agreement in a form approved by the city attorney and under which the applicant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the city harmless from any and all liability associated with the work, in lieu of the general liability insurance policy required by subsection B of this section. (Ord. 98-09 § 1, 1998; Ord. 92-24 § 1 (part), 1992)

Upon the date of completion, or when notified by the applicant of the project’s completion if earlier than the stated date of completion, the city engineer, or his or her designee, shall make an inspection to determine if city facilities or properties have been restored without damage. If the city engineer or his or her designee determines that the project has not been satisfactorily completed, then the applicant will be given written instructions describing the work which needs completion. Additionally, depending on the nature and scope of the work performed under the permit, the city engineer may require that a set of engineer certified “as-built” plans be submitted when work is accepted by the city.

C.    Buildings with multiple tenant spaces, suites or dwelling units shall receive one numerical designation per building.

Exceptions:

1.    Mini-storage complexes may have one address for multiple buildings provided each building is designated with the numerical designation of the complex as well as the individual unit designation and the site plan showing all building and unit designations is submitted to and approved by the department.

2.    Residential duplexes may have two numerical designations.

D.    The numerical designations shall be assigned based on the geographic direction of the way of travel, as determined by observing its overall length and noting its general or predominant direction, as follows:

1.    In the northwest and northeast districts, even numerical designations shall be assigned to the north and east sides of ways of travel and odd numerical designations shall be assigned to the south and west sides of ways of travel.

E.    From the point of origin, when possible, even and odd numerical designations shall be assigned consecutively and opposite one another for the entire way of travel in which they are situated when initially named.

Exception: Buildings and real property situated on a circle, court, or loop shall be numbered consecutively beginning at the point of origin and proceeding progressively around such circle, court or loop in a clockwise direction.

F.    Buildings with multiple tenant spaces, suites or dwelling units shall have the suites/units further identified with suite, unit or apartment numbers. Assignment of suite or apartment numbers of commercial occupancies shall be from left to right facing the buildings or units. All suite, apartment or unit numbers shall use “100” numbers for units located on the first floor of buildings, “200” numbers for units located on the second floor, “300” numbers for units on the third floor, and continue likewise for successive floors. Suite, unit or apartment numbers on floor levels below the first floor (sub-grade levels) shall use the letter “S” preceding the suite/unit numbers. For example, on the floor level immediately below the first floor, “S100” numbers shall be used. The next floor level down shall use “S200” numbers and continue likewise for successive sub-grade or basement levels.

1.    Multi-unit commercial occupancies, other than Group R, shall have suite/unit numbers in ten-number increments, whenever possible, to ensure adequate opportunity for future changes to be numbered in correct order. When the building has an odd numerical designation, suite/unit numbers shall be odd. For example, a building with an address of 123 NW Alphabet St. would have suite/units 101, 111, 121, etc. on the first floor; 201, 211, 221 on the second floor, etc. Buildings with even numerical designations shall use even suite/unit numbers.

2.    Multi-unit commercial occupancies with Group R units shall have suite/unit numbers consecutively. For example, a multi-unit Group R building would have suite/units 100, 101, 102, 103 on the first floor, suite/units 200, 201, 202, 203 on the second floor, etc. A multi-unit Group R building with interior access corridors may use consecutive even and odd numbers on opposite sides of the corridor. Suite/unit numbers of different floors, whenever possible, shall be “stacked”; for example, unit 112 should be directly below unit 212, which would be directly below unit 312, etc. (Ord. 2014-13 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2014)


12.24.070 Denoting of ways of travel.

A.    Ways of travel shall be named when they serve a minimum of three or more parcels, or three or more buildings with an occupancy group other than Group U. Requests for names shall be petitioned to, and approved by, the department.

The name is the principal identifying component of a full way of travel name, which in most cases should uniquely distinguish a way of travel from all others. In addition to emergency response, addresses are used to record the location of events and objects in databases throughout the city. It is important that names be easy to input correctly. The following criteria reflect that need as well as the needs of emergency response:

1.    No name shall be used more than once. For example, two ways of travel may not be named Cedar even if they are different types.

2.    Names shall not sound alike. For example, two ways of travel may not be named Stephen and Steven.

3.    Names that tend to be mispronounced or misspelled should not be used. For example, names like Javelina, Weimaraner, and Perseverance are either hard to spell or pronounce and would be subject to increased scrutiny during the name review process; provided, that names that reflect the community’s history, culture or heritage may be considered.

4.    Names should be composed of one word wherever possible and limited to thirteen characters or less. This does not include directionals or identifiers which are assigned by the department according to the official map.

5.    Two-word names or one-word names that can be confused as two-word names shall not be used. For example, names like Clearlake, Clear Lake, and Baytree would not be acceptable.

6.    Names that include directional words such as North, South, East, or West shall be avoided. For example, North East Beach would not be acceptable.

7.    Names that include punctuation shall be used without the punctuation. For example, NW George’s Rd would be approved as NW Georges Rd.

8.    Except where historically significant, names shall not include proper names.

9.    The department shall promote name continuity. For example, a private road or unmaintained city road extending from the end of a dead-end city-maintained road shall retain the same name.

10.    Names shall not include any of the types listed in Section 12.24.020, Definitions. For example, Mountain Loop Rd would not be an acceptable name.

B.    Name changes may be initiated by the department when the name fails to meet the criteria in subsection A of this section or when the name serves to compromise the E911 system in any way. The department shall work in cooperation with CenCom and other departments in making changes. Except as detailed in this section, existing names shall not be required to meet the criteria of this chapter.

C.    The department is authorized to affirmatively take all lawful action to cure or fix the problem of names not meeting the criteria of this chapter provided written notice of the proposed action is provided to all persons owning property on the way of travel in question, and all persons affected or impacted by the proposed action, via U.S. mail or other appropriate means, and all the following procedures are followed:

1.    Petition for name will be mailed to each parcel owner allowing thirty days from the date of the letter to provide input on the name selection.

2.    If a majority vote is not received for a name that can be approved by the department, a second letter will be sent out to each parcel owner allowing an additional fourteen days from the date of the letter to provide input on the proposed name selection.

3.    If a simple majority vote is not received for a name that can be approved by the department, then the department will select the new name.

4.    When the approved name has been selected and assigned by the department, a letter will be sent out to each parcel owner with the approved name and instructions for the construction of the sign. On private road or unmaintained city road, the parcel owners shall have the sign constructed and installed within thirty days.

5.    When the naming process is complete, a letter will be sent out to each parcel owner notifying them of the new address number assignment with the new name. The parcel owners shall have the new address numbers posted within thirty days.

D.    All new or replaced name signs shall be constructed and placed pursuant to city public works sign standards. Costs and maintenance of any signs for a private or unmaintained road shall be the sole responsibility of the parcel owners on said road. Failure to maintain signs for a private or unmaintained road can constitute a separate class I civil infraction against each and every parcel owner served by such road, in accordance with Section 12.24.090. (Ord. 2014-13 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2014)


12.24.080 Display of designations.

A.    The owner, occupant, tenant, lessee or any other person or entity having an interest in any addressed building shall conspicuously display the numerical designation assigned to such building. The numerical designation shall be easily legible with numerals displayed upon a contrasting background, for example, black on white, or white on blue, etc. Whenever possible, numerical designations should not be placed on window glazing.

1.    Number size for all residential occupancies shall be four inches minimum height with one-half-inch stroke.

2.    All commercial addresses shall be posted as follows: numerals on buildings located fifty feet or less from the named way of travel shall be twelve inches minimum height with one-and-one-half-inch stroke; numerals on buildings located between fifty and one hundred feet from the named way of travel shall be eighteen inches in height with two-inch stroke; numerals on buildings located more than one hundred feet from the named way of travel shall be twenty-four inches minimum height with two-and-one-half-inch stroke.

B.    Premises Identification. Approved numbers or address shall be posted for all new and existing buildings in such a position, facing the way of travel, as to be plainly visible and legible from the way of travel fronting the property. If the numerical designation of the building is not clearly visible from a named way of travel, the numerical designation shall also be displayed near the main entrance to the property and the driveway entrance upon which the building is situated.

12.28.135 Abandoned and derelict vessels.

A.    A city law enforcement officer, upon discovering an apparently abandoned or derelict vessel within city waters, shall attach to the vessel a readily visible notification sticker which contains the following information:

2.    The identity of the officer;

3.    A statement that failure to remove the vessel within seventy-two hours from the time the sticker is attached constitutes a civil infraction subject to a monetary penalty equal to one hundred dollars for each day the vessel remains unattended within city waters; and

4.    The address and telephone number where additional information can be obtained.

B.    If the vessel has a current Washington State vessel registration number, then the law enforcement officer, after attaching the sticker specified in subsection A of this section, shall check the State Department of Licensing records to learn the identity of the last owner of record. Afterwards, the chief of police or his/her designee shall make a reasonable effort to contact the vessel’s last owner of record, if known, by telephone in order to give the owner the information on the notification sticker. Further, the chief of police or his or her designee shall provide the owner with a written notification by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the information on the notification sticker, directed to the owner’s last known address.

C.    If the vessel is not removed within seventy-two hours from the time the law enforcement officer attaches the notification sticker, then the vessel owner shall be guilty of a civil infraction and the city police department may issue a civil infraction citation to the vessel owner, if known, and take custody of the vessel and provide for the vessel’s removal to a place of safety. The city may remove the vessel prior to the termination of the seventy-two-hour period provided the vessel constitutes a hazard to persons, marine traffic or the environment. If the police department issues such a civil infraction citation, then upon a finding by the city municipal court that such an infraction has been committed, the vessel owner shall pay a monetary penalty to the city in an amount equal to one hundred dollars for each day the vessel remained unattended within city waters. The vessel owner shall be liable for all removal and storage costs incurred by the city in removing and storing the vessel. After the vessel has been removed and stored, or if removal is not necessary, after the expiration of the initial seventy-two-hour period, the police chief shall send by certified mail, with return receipt requested, a notice of custody and sale to the vessel’s legal and registered owners, if known. Such notice shall inform the owner that the vessel may be sold pursuant to subsection D of this section, and the owner has sixty days to claim the vessel. Afterwards, the city shall release the vessel to the owner provided the owner pays all penalties and costs incurred by the city in removing and storing the vessel.

D.    If, after sixty days from the date of mailing the notice of custody and sale required in subsection C of this section to the registered and legal owner or sixty days after the initial seventy-two-hour period passes in the case of an unknown vessel owner, the vessel remains unclaimed and has not been identified as a stolen vessel, the chief of police or his/her designee shall publish a notice of public auction in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and county in which the vessel is located. Such notice shall state the date, place and time of the auction, contain a description of the vessel to be sold, and shall be published at least ten days prior to the date fixed for the sale. If the owner fails to reclaim the vessel prior to the time fixed for the sale in such notice, the chief of police or his or her designee shall conduct the sale and sell the vessel described in the notice at public auction to the highest and best bidder, for cash, and upon payment of the amount of such bid shall deliver the vessel to such bidder. The moneys arising from sales under the provisions of this section shall be first applied to the expenses of the sale, and then to the payment of lawful charges and expenses for the removal and storage of the vessel. Any balance shall be paid into Fund No. 622, Marine Vessel Trust Fund, of the city. If the vessel owner or his legal representative shall, at any time within three years after the money shall have been deposited in Fund No. 622, Marine Vessel Trust Fund, furnish satisfactory evidence of ownership to the police chief or city treasurer, then the owner shall be entitled to receive from the police chief or city treasurer the balance of the funds deposited in the fund with interest.

All divers must mark their area of activity with an adequately displayed diver’s flag. All passing vessels and watercraft shall give at least two hundred feet clearance to such a flag. (Ord. 86-41 § 1 (part), 1986)


12.28.170 Exemption for emergency vessels.

Any authorized emergency vessel or watercraft actually responding to an emergency call or in immediate pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of this chapter or any other federal or state regulation shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 86-41 § 1 (part), 1986)


12.28.180 Liability.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as exempting any person, firm or corporation from liability caused by wake action from operation of any watercraft, vessel or aircraft, nor shall this chapter be construed as limiting or exempting such persons from liability for any unsafe operation of any watercraft, vessel or aircraft. (Ord. 86-41 § 1 (part), 1986)


12.28.190 Impoundment.

A.    The city and its local law enforcement officials may take immediate possession of and impound any vessel or watercraft located in any waters within the city’s jurisdiction when:

1.    The operator or owner of the vessel or watercraft is incapable of safely operating the vessel or watercraft or is incapable of directing the disposition of the vessel or watercraft;

2.    The operator or owner of the vessel or watercraft refuses or neglects to obey an order of any local law enforcement official to proceed from or to an area following a citation or civil infraction or in an emergency;

3.    The operator or owner operates the vessel or watercraft in a negligent, reckless or other manner so as to endanger the safety of others or to unreasonably interfere with the navigation of other watercraft and vessels, and the local law enforcement official believes such operation of the vessel or watercraft would continue unless the vessel or watercraft is impounded;

4.    The vessel or watercraft in operation is unsafe for water transportation;

5.    The vessel or watercraft is obstructing a launch area or public dock, or is trespassing or blocking ingress and egress on private property;

6.    An unattended vessel or watercraft is a navigational hazard or threat to public safety, or must otherwise be impounded or removed in response to an emergency situation.

B.    In lieu of removing or towing a vessel or watercraft pursuant to this section, the city and its local law enforcement officials may impound any vessel or watercraft in place by posting one or more signs or notices in conspicuous places on the vessel or watercraft that read: “POLICE IMPOUND—KEEP OFF.” Upon the posting of an impound notice, it shall be unlawful for any person:

1.    To move, load, unload, rebuild or enter upon such vessel or watercraft without written permission from the city, other than for necessary maintenance and repair to prevent the deterioration or sinking of the vessel or watercraft; or

2.    To remove, mutilate destroy or conceal any notice or sign posted by the city pursuant to this section.

The city and its local law enforcement officials, in their discretion, may appoint the owner or operator of the facility or property at which the vessel or watercraft is moored or anchored as custodian of the impounded vessel or watercraft.

C.    At the time of the impound of a vessel or watercraft pursuant to subsections A and B of this section, the city or its local law enforcement officials shall provide the owner or operator of the vessel or watercraft written notice of the impound. If the owner or operator is not present, the notice shall be mailed, via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner of the vessel or watercraft at the owner’s last known address. Such notice shall state the date and time of the impound, the identity of the city official impounding the vessel or watercraft, the nature of the violation for which the vessel or watercraft was impounded, information on how and where to redeem the impounded vessel or watercraft, the owner’s right to a hearing on the impound pursuant to Section 12.28.210, a hearing request form, and the address and telephone number where additional information may be obtained.

D.    The city and its local law enforcement official shall have the authority to remove or tow any vessel or watercraft pursuant to this section by using such methods necessary to prevent unnecessary damage to the vessel or watercraft. Alternatively, the city and its local law enforcement officials may assign the removal and impound of the vessel or watercraft to a private corporation.

E.    The city shall not be responsible for damages incurred as a result of the impoundment of a vessel or watercraft. (Ord. 2007-41 § 13, 2007: Ord. 86-41 § 1 (part), 1986)


12.28.200 Creation and foreclosure of lien.

A.    The expenses incurred by the city in removing, impounding and mooring any vessel or watercraft pursuant to this chapter shall be borne by the owner of the vessel or watercraft. When a vessel or watercraft is moored or impounded at a city facility, the city shall assess a reasonable moorage charge established by resolution. The expenses incurred by the city in removing, impounding and mooring the vessel or watercraft, and the city’s moorage charge, if applicable, shall constitute a lien against the vessel or watercraft and shall be paid in full by the owner of the vessel or watercraft prior to the city’s release of the vessel or watercraft.

B.    If an impounded vessel or watercraft is not redeemed within sixty days after the date of impoundment, the lien upon the vessel or watercraft arising under this chapter may be foreclosed by the city pursuant to Chapter 60.10 RCW.

C.    Funds received from the sale of a vessel or watercraft pursuant to this section shall be applied towards payment of the costs and fees incurred by the city in removing, impounding and mooring the vessel or watercraft, to the city’s moorage charges, if applicable, and to the costs of foreclosure, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The city may maintain an action against the owner of the vessel or watercraft to recover the expense of removing, impounding and mooring the vessel or watercraft, the city’s moorage charge, and the costs of foreclosure of the lien, if not fully satisfied by the sale of the vessel or watercraft.

D.    Any remaining proceeds from the foreclosure sale of a vessel or watercraft shall be remitted to the owner of the vessel or watercraft, if known. If the city is unable to locate the owner of the vessel or watercraft, the remainder of the proceeds from the sale shall be retained by the city for six months, and shall be released to the owner upon sufficient proof of ownership. If the six-month period expires without the owner of the vessel or watercraft claiming the remainder of the proceeds from the sale, the funds shall be deposited into the general fund of the city. (Ord. 2007-41 § 14, 2007)


12.28.210 Impound hearing.

A.    Any owner of a vessel or watercraft that has been impounded pursuant to this chapter may request an impound hearing in the Poulsbo municipal court to contest the propriety of the impound and the amount of the impound and storage fees.

B.    Any request for an impound hearing pursuant to this section shall be made in writing on the form provided by the city and must be received by the municipal court within twenty-one days (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the date that the notice of the right to a hearing was provided to the person seeking to challenge the impound or amount of the impound and storage fees. If the impound hearing request is not received by the municipal court within the twenty-one-day period (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays), the right to a hearing is waived and the owner of the vessel or watercraft is liable for any removal, storage or impound charges permitted by this chapter. Upon receipt of a timely request for an impound hearing, the municipal court shall proceed to hear and determine the propriety of the impound.

C.    The municipal court, within five days after it receives a request for an impound hearing, shall notify the person requesting the hearing and the city in writing of the hearing date and time.

D.    At the hearing, the person or persons requesting the hearing may produce any relevant evidence to show that the removal, impound, or storage fees charged were not proper. The city has the burden of proving a valid impound and reasonable fees by a preponderance of the evidence.

E.    At the conclusion of the hearing, the municipal court shall determine whether the impound was proper, whether the removal, impound or storage fees charged were proper, and who is responsible for the payment of the fees.

F.    If the impound is found proper, the removal, impound and storage fees as permitted under this chapter together with court costs may be assessed against the person or persons requesting the hearing.

G.    If the impound is found to be in violation of this code, then the owner of the impounded vessel or watercraft shall not be responsible for any removal, impound or storage fees, and any security shall be returned or discharged as appropriate, and the person or agency who authorized the impound shall be liable for any removal, storage or other impoundment fees permitted under this chapter. (Ord. 2007-41 § 15, 2007)

In addition to any other remedy provided by this chapter, the city may initiate injunction or abatement proceedings or any other appropriate action in the courts against any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter to prevent, enjoin, abate or terminate violations or to restore a condition which existed prior to the violation. The violator shall pay the costs of such action including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

C.    Any person who fails to respond or appear on any violation of any provision of the Poulsbo Municipal Code set forth in this title shall be assessed a failure to respond or appear fee in the amount set forth in RCW 46.63.110(4), as the same now exists or as may be hereafter amended, which statute is incorporated herein by this reference as if fully set forth.

D.    If a time pay agreement is requested, a fee of not to exceed ten dollars per charge or twenty-five dollars per payment plan may be imposed. (Ord. 2007-41 § 16, 2007)

The purpose of this title is to ensure the orderly growth of the water and sewer systems of the city of Poulsbo, and to avoid unfairness which may result from treating each new addition and replacement as a separate improvement without relation to the whole system. It is the express intent of the city council that the water and sewer utilities shall be self-supporting utilities operated without drawing upon the general funds of the city. It is the aim of the council by this chapter to provide that:

A.    The total revenue of the utilities is sufficient to render the utilities self-supporting;

B.    The cost of installation of that portion of a utility which specially benefits the real property in the area served shall be assessed against the property on a proportionate basis;

C.    The total annual revenues of the utilities shall be contributed by users and nonusers for whose use, need and benefit the facilities of the utility are provided, approximately in proportion to the cost of providing the use and benefits of the utility;

D.    Application Processing Fee. If an outside utility extension is deemed necessary by city council, the applicant shall submit a completed application form provided by the city together with a processing fee as determined by Section 3.12.100 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code. (Ord. 2003-33 § 4, 2003; Ord. 83-14 § 2, 1983)


13.04.020 Code adopted.

The compilation of regulations entitled “City of Poulsbo Water and Sewer Code,” a copy of which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and set out in Chapter 13.06, is adopted as the regulations governing water and sanitary sewer service for the city of Poulsbo, Washington. The city clerk is directed to maintain a copy of such regulations on file in the office of the city clerk for public inspection. (Ord. 83-14 § 1, 1983)


13.04.030 Revenues.

The rates to be charged for utility service shall be fixed by separate ordinance, and shall be adequate to provide for ordinary maintenance, bond redemption and operating costs of the system. (Ord. 83-14 § 3, 1983)


13.04.040 Creation of joint utilities.

The sewer and the water system of the city of Poulsbo shall be combined as joint utilities; provided, however, that there shall be taken from all money received such amounts as are necessary to provide the special funds heretofore provided for the retirement of bonds. (Ord. 123 § 1, 1944)


13.04.050 Powers not limited.

This chapter neither extends nor limits the powers of the water and sewer utilities, but is merely for the purpose of combining the two for the purposes set out in Section 13.04.040. (Ord. 123 § 2, 1944)

A replacement unit is defined to be a housing unit lawfully constructed in the city of Poulsbo in accordance with all provisions of city ordinance and the State Building Code, which has been removed from service and for which an approved development plan or building permit application has been submitted. Payment of the monthly service charge shall vest the applicant to sewer capacity as of the date of payment, in the chronological order in which the payment is first made. Failure to pay any monthly charge shall terminate this vesting provision.

B.    Nothing herein shall be interpreted to obligate the city to issue a building permit or to provide a sewer hook-up if adequate sewer capacity does not exist downstream at the date of application for a building permit. For example, and by way of illustration and not limitation, the city may be obligated to deny permits in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code or in the event an act of God or failure of equipment and facilities reduces the capacity of the city’s sewage transmission facilities, the enactment of a moratorium pursuant to the provisions of RCW 70.05.160 which prohibits further sewage connections, the order of a court or state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction, or a finding by the city council on the recommendation of the mayor and city engineer that all or part of the sewer facilities exceed current transmission capacity. In such cases, the city will endeavor to provide additional capacity in accordance with its permitting obligations by the repair, reconstruction or construction of sewage facilities in accordance with state or federal law. Upon construction of adequate sewage facilities, permits shall be issued to vested applicants in the chronological order in which they vested. In the event of conflict between the vesting rights of any owner or applicant for a building permit for a new housing unit with the vesting rights created pursuant to this section for a replacement unit, the replacement unit shall be given priority.

B.    In cases where the city council determines that annexation of a property located within the city’s urban growth area is not currently feasible, the council may, in its sole and absolute discretion, allow extension of utility service to the property prior to annexation if the property owner executes an agreement containing all of the provisions set forth in Section 13.14.020 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code.

C.    In cases where an owner of property located outside of the city’s urban growth area requests extension of utility service, the city council may, in its sole and absolute discretion, allow extension of utility service if the property owner executes an agreement containing all of the provisions set forth in Section 13.14.020 of the Poulsbo Municipal Code and:

1.    In the case of water service, where the local health official certifies that water supplied by an existing well or wells serving an existing residence or residences is unsafe to drink or provides insufficient quantity for domestic use and the well is physically incapable of being repaired or replaced in a manner meeting applicable health standards; or

2.    In the case of sewer service, where (a) the local health official certifies that an existing septic system or system serving an existing residence or residences has failed and is physically incapable of being repaired or replaced in a manner meeting applicable health standards; (b) extension is shown to be necessary to protect basic public health and safety and the environment; and (c) the sewer services provided by the extension are financially sustainable at rural densities and do not permit urban development; or

3.    In the case of both water and sewer service, where service is to be provided solely to publicly owned facilities.

D.    Nothing in this section is intended to abrogate any existing utility extension agreements. (Ord. 2006-09 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 2002-17 § 1, 2002: Ord. 2002-10 § 1, 2002: Ord. 88-62 § 1 (part), 1988)


13.14.020 Utility extension agreements.

A.    In the event that the city council determines, pursuant to Section 13.14.010, to allow extension of utility services beyond the city limits, the owner of the property for which service is authorized must execute a utility extension agreement containing all of the following terms and conditions:

1.    A warranty that the owner has title to the property and is authorized to enter into the agreement;

2.    A statement specifying the location and line from which service may be extended;

3.    An agreement by the owner to pay all costs of designing, engineering and constructing the extension to city standards and according to plans approved by the city public works department;

4.    A requirement that the owner secure and obtain, at the owner’s sole cost and expense, any necessary permits, easements and licenses to construct the extension;

5.    An agreement by the owner to turn over and dedicate any capital facilities, such as main lines, pump stations and wells, to the city upon completion of construction and to furnish as-built plans, any necessary easements, permits or licenses, a bill of sale, and a maintenance guarantee to the city;

6.    An agreement by the owner to pay utility connection charges;

7.    An agreement by the owner to pay all utility service charges at rates applicable to properties outside the city limits;

8.    An agreement by the owner to annex the property to the city at such time as the owner is requested by the city to do so and granting the mayor a power of attorney on behalf of the property to execute any applicable landowner petition necessary for annexation of the property in the event the owner fails or refuses to do so;

9.    For properties within the city’s urban growth area, a restriction on the use of the property to those uses authorized by the Poulsbo urban growth subarea plan approved by the city and Kitsap County;

10.    For properties outside the city’s urban growth area meeting the requirements of Section 13.14.010(C) of the Poulsbo Municipal Code, a restriction on the use of the property to those uses authorized by the Kitsap County Comprehensive Plan and zoning code and which do not constitute urban development;

11.    A statement that delinquent payments under the agreement will constitute a lien which may be foreclosed in the same manner as other liens for utility service;

12.    A statement that the city may terminate service in the event of noncompliance by the owner with any term or condition of the agreement;

13.    A waiver of the right to protest formation of a local improvement district for improvements which would benefit the subject property;

14.    A clause providing that the agreement may be specifically enforced;

15.    A requirement that the agreement be recorded with the Kitsap County auditor and constitute a covenant running with the land receiving service, and providing that all costs of recording the agreement will be paid by the owner;

16.    A clause providing for attorney’s fees in the event of litigation;

17.    A provision allowing the city to deny connection in the event of a lack of capacity at the time connection is to be physically made; and

18.    A provision rendering the agreement null and void if connection is not made and service is not extended within two years after the agreement is executed.

B.    Any necessary approval by the boundary review board must be received prior to extension of service. Any agreement for which such approval has not been received prior to execution must contain a provision making the extension of service contingent upon receipt of such approval.

C.    Upon execution of the agreement and receipt of all approvals, the agreement shall be recorded with the Kitsap County auditor as a covenant running with the land, and all costs of recording shall be paid by the owner in accord with the terms of the agreement. (Ord. 2006-09 § 1 (part), 2006)

6.    Nonstormwater discharges covered by another NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency or Washington State Department of Ecology; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations; and provided, that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system;

7.    Discharges resulting from maintenance, repair, or operation of fire fighting equipment and facilities that are not directly associated with public fire fighting, including discharges from public fire fighting training exercises, unless city-approved best management practices are implemented;

8.    Other nonstormwater discharges shall be in compliance with the requirements of a stormwater pollution prevention plan reviewed and approved by the city, which addresses control of such discharges by applying AKART to prevent contaminants from entering surface or groundwater.

C.    Allowable Discharges. The following types of discharges shall not be considered illicit discharges for the purposes of this chapter if they do not contain pollutants or unless the director determines that the type of discharge, whether singly or in combination with others, is causing or is likely to cause pollution of surface water or groundwater:

1.    Diverted stream flows, rising groundwaters, uncontaminated groundwater infiltration (as defined in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations: 40 CFR 35.2005(20)), uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water from agricultural sources that is commingled with urban stormwater, springs, water from crawl space pumps, footing drains, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, and discharges from emergency fire fighting activities in accordance with Section S2, Authorized Discharges, of the city’s NPDES permit.

2.    Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary to protect public health and safety.

3.    If a person can demonstrate that there are no additional pollutants being discharged from the premises above the background conditions of the water entering the site, that person shall not be in violation of subsection A of this section.

D.    Prohibition of Illicit Connections.

1.    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 

2.    Any connection identified by the director that could convey anything not composed entirely of surface and stormwater directly into municipal drainage facilities is considered an illicit connection and is prohibited with the following exceptions: connections conveying allowable discharges or connections conveying discharges pursuant to an NPDES permit or a state waste discharge permit. 

3.    Illicit connections must be disconnected and redirected, if warranted, to an approved on-site wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the city.

4.    Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which is connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the city requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer, or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the city. 

E.    Prohibition of Stormwater Discharge to Sanitary Sewer. Stormwater shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer without written permission to do so from the city of Poulsbo.

F.    Prohibition of Waste Disposal. No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, or keep in or upon any public or private property, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of the state any refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles, or accumulations that may cause or contribute to pollution. Wastes deposited in proper nonleaking waste receptacles for the purposes of collection are exempt from this prohibition. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.080 Suspension of MS4 access.

A.    Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the public health or welfare, or to the MS4, or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.

B.    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. The city may terminate a person’s MS4 access if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may appeal such termination in accordance with Section 13.18.140(C)(3). No person shall reinstate MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the city. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.090 Industrial or construction activity discharges.

Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. The city may require proof of compliance with said permit in a form acceptable to the city prior to allowing discharges to the MS4. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.100 Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices (BMPs).

A.    General. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system, watercourses, surface water, or groundwater through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs which have been approved by the city for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the state. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

B.    BMP Descriptions. Approved BMPs are described in the stormwater management manual(s) adopted by the city. The manual(s) describes the types of regulated activities, the types of contaminants generated by each activity, the contaminant’s affect on water quality, the required source control BMPs, and the available treatment BMPs. The manual(s) includes information on design, maintenance, and allowable use of additional or alternative BMPs.

C.    Priority of BMP Implementation. In applying the BMP manual, the director shall first require the implementation of source control BMPs unless the BMP manual specifically requires treatment BMPs. If source control BMPs (or treatment BMPs if required by the BMP manual) do not prevent contaminants from entering surface and stormwater or groundwater, the director may require implementation of additional source control BMPs and/or treatment BMPs according to AKART. 

D.    Prevention of Pollution of Surface and Groundwater. BMPs shall be applied as required herein, so that when all appropriate combinations of individual BMPs are utilized, pollution of surface or groundwater is prevented. If all BMPs required herein or by the director are applied, and pollution still occurs, the discharger shall modify existing practices or apply further water pollution control measures, as specified by the director. In the absence of implementation of applicable BMPs, the director shall be authorized to conclude that individual activities are causing pollution in violation of this chapter, and shall be authorized to enforce this chapter accordingly. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.110 Watercourse protection.

Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.120 Notification of illicit discharges.

A.    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person, including any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, who has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting, or may result, in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.

1.    In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services (911) and the public works department (360-779-4078). 

2.    In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the public works department in person or by phone (360-779-4078) or facsimile (360-779-6384) within forty-eight hours after said discharge. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone notice.

B.    If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained in accordance with Section 13.18.170. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.130 Inspection and investigation.

A.    Authorization.

1.    Whenever implementing the provisions of this chapter or whenever there is cause to believe that a violation of this chapter has been or is being committed, the director is authorized to inspect during regular working hours and at other reasonable times all stormwater facilities within the city of Poulsbo to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

2.    The director may observe BMPs or examine and/or sample surface and stormwater or groundwater as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The director is further authorized, as set forth in subsection B of this section, to enter in or upon any public or private property for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the pollution of, or the possible pollution of, surface and/or groundwater. Whenever an on-site inspection of a property is made, the findings shall be documented. A copy of the inspection findings shall be furnished to the owner or the person in charge of the property after the conclusion of the investigation.

B.    Right of Entry. The director is authorized to enter at all reasonable times in or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of inspecting and investigating any conditions relating to the provisions of this chapter or any regulation adopted under this chapter; provided, that the city shall first obtain from the owner or person responsible for such premises permission to enter. If entry is refused, the city shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.

1.    If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the director.

2.    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the facility operator.

3.    No person who is the owner or operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity shall deny the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter.

C.    Obstructing the Director. No person shall obstruct the director in the performance of his or her official duties in the enforcement of this chapter, including but not limited to:

1.    Intentional use of, or threat to use, force to obstruct a person he or she knows, or should reasonably know, is the director and is performing his or her official duties in the enforcement of stormwater system regulations; or

2.    Acting in a manner that he or she knows, or should reasonably know, will interfere with or obstruct a person known to be, or who should reasonably be known to be, responsible for the enforcement of stormwater system regulations; or

3.    Refusing to identify himself or herself and give his or her current address to the director for the enforcement of this chapter pursuant to an investigation of a violation upon request by the director.

D.    Inspection Requirements. The director is authorized to develop inspection procedures and requirements for all stormwater facilities in the city of Poulsbo.

1.    Prior to making any inspections on private property, the director shall present identification credentials, state the reason for the inspection, and request entry.

2.    If the property, or any building or structure on the property, is unoccupied, the director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property or portions of the property and request entry.

3.    Unless entry is consented to by the owner or person(s) in control of the property, or portion of the property, or unless conditions are reasonably believed to exist in the opinion of the director which create immediate danger to public health or safety, the director shall obtain a search warrant or other remedy, prior to entry, as authorized by the laws of the state of Washington.

4.    If, after reasonable effort, the director is unable to locate the owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property, and there is reason to believe the condition of the stormwater system creates an immediate danger to public health or safety in the opinion of the director, the director may enter.

5.    Nothing in this section prevents the director from inspecting a stormwater system without consent of the property owner or a search warrant, provided the inspection can be conducted while remaining on public property or other property on which permission to enter is obtained.

E.    Monitoring, Sampling, and Analysis. 

1.    Whenever the director determines that any person has violated or is violating the provisions of this chapter, the director may require the person responsible for the violation to sample and analyze any discharge, surface water, stormwater, groundwater, and/or sediment, in accordance with sampling and analytical procedures or requirements determined by the director. When the director has reason to believe that a connection is resulting in an illicit discharge, the director may sample and analyze the discharge and recover the costs from a person in an enforcement proceeding. When the discharge is likely to contain illicit discharges on a recurring basis, the director may conduct, or may require the person to conduct, ongoing monitoring (including sampling and testing) at the person’s expense.

2.    The city shall have the right to set up on any facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.

3.    The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. When monitoring is required, the discharger shall sample and analyze any discharge, surface and stormwater, groundwater, and/or sediment, in accordance with sampling and analytical procedures or requirements determined by the director. A copy of the analysis shall be provided to the director. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.140 Enforcement and penalties.

A.    Authorization. The director is authorized to enforce this chapter and any permit, order or approval issued pursuant to this chapter against any violation or threatened violation thereof. 

B.    Compliance. The director shall attain compliance with this chapter by requiring the implementation of BMPs. The director may initially rely on education and informational assistance to gain compliance with this chapter, unless the director determines a violation poses a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare, endangers any property, or adversely affects the safety and operation of city right-of-way, utilities and/or other property owned or maintained by the city, that should be addressed through immediate penalties. The director may demand immediate cessation of discharges and assess penalties for violations that are an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or danger to the environment. Enforcement actions shall escalate for noncompliance. Enforcement shall include one or more of the following actions, singly or in combination. The director may apply whatever enforcement action, or combination of actions, is determined appropriate within the following range of actions, regardless of the position in the range:

1.    Written warning with voluntary compliance. May be applied to first-time, minor violations. Educational materials and informational assistance will be provided to the violator.

2.    Compensatory actions such as community service related to stormwater education or mitigation in lieu of penalty or enforcement proceedings. Requires a formal written agreement between the director and the violator. 

3.    Written notice of violation ordering compliance. 

4.    Civil penalties. Includes daily financial penalty imposed by a judicial authority for each day the violation remains unfixed.

5.    Criminal prosecution. Applies to intentional and flagrant violations of this chapter. Each day discharge continues shall be considered a separate offense which can result in fines and imprisonment.

6.    Emergency cease and desist order. Applies when this chapter continues to be violated. Requires immediate compliance with this chapter by halting operations and/or terminating discharges.

7.    Disconnection from the MS4. Applies to illicit connections to MS4, to illicit discharges in emergency situations, or continued failure of the property owner to comply.

C.    Notice and Order.

1.    Contents. The director shall have authority to issue to an owner or person responsible for a violation of this chapter an order to maintain or repair a component of a stormwater facility or BMP to bring it into compliance with this chapter or other city regulations, to remove any illicit connection, to cease any illicit discharge, and to repair or remediate any damages to the environment caused by any such violation.

j.    A statement advising that the order shall become final unless, no later than ten working days after the notice and order are served, any person aggrieved by the order requests an appeal in accordance with Section 13.18.150.

2.    Service. Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons identified in the notice and order either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. If the address of any such person cannot reasonably be ascertained, a copy of the notice and order shall be mailed to such person at the address of the location of the violation. The failure of any such person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. Service by certified mail in the manner provided in this section shall be effective on the date of postmark. The notice and order may be, but is not required to be, posted on the subject property.

3.    Appeal. Persons to whom the notice and order of the director is issued may appeal the same within ten working days of service. The appeal must be in accordance with Section 13.18.150.

H.    Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. Any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator’s expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

I.    Summary Abatement.

1.    Whenever any violation of this chapter causes or creates a condition the continued existence of which constitutes, in the opinion of the director, an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the director may summarily and without prior notice, at the cost of the owner, abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. 

2.    Within fifteen days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including labor and materials, legal expenses, administrative costs, and interest. Persons to whom the assessment of costs of abatement is issued may appeal the same within ten working days of service. The appeal must be in accordance with Section 13.18.150. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 

The owner shall pay the abatement costs in not more than twelve equal payments. Such costs shall accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum or the rate charged to the city for obtaining the funds necessary to abate, whichever interest is greater. 

J.    Injunctive Relief. In addition to any other remedy provided by this chapter or the Poulsbo Municipal Code, the city may initiate injunction or abatement proceedings or any other appropriate action in courts against any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter and/or to restore a condition which existed prior to the violation. In any such proceeding, the person violating and/or failing to comply with any provisions of this chapter shall be liable for the costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the city in bringing, maintaining, and/or prosecuting such action.

K.    Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state, or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative remedies. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.150 Appeals.

A.    The director’s notice and order or assessment of costs of abatement may be appealed to the city council by persons to whom the notice and order or assessment of costs of abatement is issued. An appeal shall be considered timely if, but only if, it is filed in writing with the director within ten working days of service, and the appeal fee adopted by the city council is paid in full. In addition to the appeal fee, if the director determines that the services of an independent consultant are reasonably necessary in adjudicating the appeal, the appellant shall make an initial cash deposit to pay for an independent review as the same may be reasonably required by the director. The initial deposit, which is only an estimate of the consultant’s costs, shall be paid in advance of the hearing. If it is determined during any point in the appeal process that the initial deposit is insufficient to cover all reasonable consultant’s costs, the appellant shall be required to make an additional deposit in an amount sufficient to cover the same. Any portion of the deposit that is not used to cover all reasonable consultant’s costs shall be refunded to the appellant. The amount of the deposit shall be at least five hundred dollars but not more than one thousand five hundred dollars, and it shall be determined by the director based upon a good faith estimate of permissible costs. The appellant shall be given equal access to any report prepared by the consultant.

The city Council hearing shall be scheduled within sixty days after the appeal is accepted. The director shall reject any appeal that fails to meet the filing and submittal requirements of this section. The appeal fee shall be refunded in the event the director rejects the appeal or in the event that the appellant files a statement with the director withdrawing the appeal at least fifteen calendar days before the scheduled hearing. In all other cases, the appeal fee shall be nonrefundable.

C.    The written appeal shall contain all of the following information and attachments:

1.    A copy of the notice and order or assessment of costs of abatement being appealed;

2.    The name of the property owner and, if applicable, the owner’s agent;

3.    The name and signature of each appellant and a statement showing that each is entitled to file the appeal under subsection A of this section; and

4.    A statement of appeal identifying each issue in the notice and order or assessment of costs of abatement that the appellant wishes to appeal, the reasons why each issue is in error as a matter of fact and/or law, and evidence relied upon.

D.    The city council, under its quasi-judicial authority, shall hear the appeal in an open record hearing. At least ten business days before the hearing, notice of the same shall be mailed to parties who are entitled to notice of the decision. The notice of hearing does not need to be posted or published. The appeal shall be limited to those issues raised in subsection (C)(4) of this section, and shall be similar in format as other quasi-judicial matters that may from time to time come before the city council.

E.    At least ten business days before the hearing, the appellant shall submit, as part of the record, a report to the city council containing a statement of the issues and applicable laws, discussion and analysis, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and copies of any pertinent document referenced therein. The burden shall be on the city to support the order of the director by a preponderance of the evidence. Reports, if any, prepared by the independent consultant referenced above in subsection A of this section shall be part of the record. The city council shall decide as follows, based upon the record made during the course of the public hearing:

1.    Uphold the order or assessment of costs of abatement of the director in its entirety; or

2.    Uphold the order or assessment of costs of abatement of the director in part and reverse the order or assessment of costs of abatement in part; or

The director shall serve a copy of the final decision to the appellant and other parties of record. Service shall be in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.18.140(C)(2). (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.160 Records retention.

If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its occurrence. Such records shall be kept and maintained on a permanent basis from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. The record shall includes books, documents, memoranda, reports, and correspondence relating to any operation, maintenance, monitoring, sampling, and chemical analysis associated with the discharge and all records which pertain to matters which are the subject of any enforcement or litigation activities brought by the director pursuant to this chapter. Copies of any or all records shall be provided to the director upon his request. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


13.18.170 Construction—Intent.

This chapter is enacted as an exercise of the city’s power to protect and preserve public health, safety, and welfare. Its provisions shall be liberally construed to give full effect to the objectives and purposes for which it was enacted. This chapter is not enacted to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will, or should be, especially protected or benefited by the terms of this chapter. The primary obligation of compliance with this chapter is placed upon the person holding title to the property. Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be, or shall be, construed to create or form a basis for liability for the city, its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of the person holding title to the property (owner of record) to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or by reason or in consequence of any act or omission, to act in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter by the city, its officers, employees, or agents. (Ord. 2009-03 § 1 (part), 2009)


Chapter 13.20 UNDERGROUNDING OF UTILITIES

Sections:

13.20.010    Required.

13.20.020    Existing aboveground facilities.

13.20.030    Distribution of plans.

13.20.040    Exceptions.

13.20.050    Costs liability.


13.20.010 Required.

A.    All new facilities for electrical, communications, cable TV or other similar types of facilities (referred to in this chapter as “utilities” or “utility services”) to be constructed on new rights-of-way acquired by the city, or new rights-of-way opened with the permission of the city upon which such utilities do not presently exist, or upon any easement granted by the city to any of the entities providing any utility services covered by the scope of this chapter, shall be placed underground in connection with the initial construction and installation of the facilities.

B.    The requirement of undergrounding shall be a condition precedent to the right of any supplier of utility services covered by this chapter to utilize the public right-of-way or other easement granted or approved by the city. (Ord. 84-47 § 1, 1984)


13.20.020 Existing aboveground facilities.

A.    From time to time the city will improve or require improvement of existing rights-of-way along which aboveground utility facilities have already been constructed. It shall be the policy of the city that in the event of an improvement of any such right-of-way requiring relocation of such aboveground utilities, that the utilities shall be undergrounded in connection with the right-of-way improvement.

B.    The city shall notify the utility companies or other providers of service required to underground existing aerial facilities of the pendency of the proposed improvement and shall, insofar as possible, provide the affected provider at least one hundred eighty days’ notice of the need to relocate facilities and underground the same. (Ord. 84-47 § 2, 1984)


13.20.030 Distribution of plans.

As plans are prepared for improvements to rights-of-way, the city engineer shall provide a minimum of one copy of the drawings to utilities who will be affected by the improvement. In addition, the city engineer shall periodically provide the utilities with copies of plans adopted by the city that project future right-of-way improvements in order to facilitate coordination of the utilities’ undergrounding programs with improvements to city rights-of-way. (Ord. 84-47 § 5, 1984)


13.20.040 Exceptions.

A.    Upon the affirmative vote of four or more members of the city council, an exception to the policy of requiring undergrounding of existing facilities may be made when it its determined that:

(Ord. 2018-15 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2003-16 § 32 (part), 2003; Ord. 2002-29 § 2 (part), 2002)

Article I. General Facility Charge—Water and Wastewater


13.70.110 Purpose of general facility charge.

A.    Fee to Be Charged. A general facility charge (GFC) shall be charged on all new or expanded service connections connecting to the utility system pursuant to the utility fee and rate schedule established in Section 3.12.100(A) for utility service. For the purposes of this section, the term “new or expanded service connections” includes discharges of stormwater into the city’s natural drainage systems, including but not limited to drainage swales, creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, and marine waters. The general facility charge shall be in addition to any special agreements or provisions for mitigation of impacts or requirements for expansion/upgrading to the utility system by any development or project.

B.    Utility System Defined. The utility system is defined as that infrastructure designed and constructed for the purpose of providing for delivery of services or natural drainage systems used for stormwater collection, conveyance, or treatment, and shall include, but not be limited to, water supply, treatment, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and stormwater collection, treatment and detention facilities, including but not limited to drainage swales, creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, and marine waters.

C.    Equitable Share. The general facility charge shall be proportionate to the cost of providing facilities and services to previously unserviced property and all changes in use that increase demand on, or discharges into, the municipal utility system. The fee shall reflect the equitable share for that connection to the utility’s system and shall be computed based on equivalent residential units (ERUs) for water and wastewater and impervious surface units (ISU) for stormwater. (Ord. 2018-15 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2017-13 § 1, 2017; Ord. 2016-14 § 1 (part), 2016; Ord. 2003-16 § 32 (part), 2003; Ord. 2002-29 § 2 (part), 2002)


13.70.120 General facility charge calculation.

A.    The general facility charge for water and wastewater shall be calculated by multiplying the number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with the service connection (as determined under Section 13.70.130) by an adjustment factor based on the type of service (as provided in Section 13.70.140) in order to arrive at an adjusted number of ERUs, and then multiplying the adjusted number of ERUs by the general facility connection cost set forth in Section 3.12.100.

	General Facility Charge =	(Adjusted # ERU) x (General Facility Connection Cost)

	Adjusted # ERU =	(# of ERU) x (Adjustment Factor)

B.    The general facility charge for stormwater shall be calculated by impervious surface unit (ISU) where one ISU is equal to three thousand square feet of impervious area as defined by Section 13.70.720(B). (Ord. 2018-15 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2016-14 § 1 (part), 2016: Ord. 2002-29 § 2 (part), 2002)


13.70.130 Calculation of equivalent residential units (ERUs).

Single-family, multifamily, commercial buildings with transitory living units, and associated residential irrigation ERUs are calculated by multiplying the number of dwelling units by the appropriate ERU adjustment factor in Section 13.70.140. Commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential and associated irrigation ERUs are calculated based on the meter flow factor equivalent ERUs in the table set forth below. The meter flow factor equivalent ERUs are based on the water meter size and shall be calculated according to the average continuous flow factor of a displacement type meter where a five-eighth-inch or three-quarter-inch meter shall have a flow factor equivalent to one ERU. There is no adjustment factor for individual commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential uses.

	Meter Size	Average Continuous Flow Factor (gpm)	Meter Flow Factor Equivalent ERUs

	5/8" or 3/4"	10	1.0

	1" (residential*)	10	1.0

	1" (commercial)	25	2.5

	1 1/2"	50	5.0

	2"	80	8.0

	3"	160	16.0

	4"	250	25.0

	6"	500	50.0

	8"	800	80.0

*    One-inch (residential) meter size calculated at 1.0 ERU only for instances in which the residence is utilizing a flow through fire sprinkler system, as installed in construction built in or after 2014. The fire suppression system requires a one-inch service meter to operate properly. The meter has the capacity to flow at twenty-five gpm but would only be utilized at that capacity in the event of a fire. Additional information regarding meter size and operation is found in Section 3.12.100.

(Ord. 2019-02 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 2018-15 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2015-09 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 2002-29 § 2 (part), 2002)


13.70.140 ERU adjustment factor.

Calculation of the general facility charge shall include an adjustment factor associated with the level of service required by the respective customer classes and shall be apportioned and assessed as noted:

	Single-family residence	1.00 ERUs/unit

	Duplex, triplex, four-plex	0.85 ERUs/unit

	Apartments/condominiums (five or more units)	0.80 ERUs/unit

	Transitory living units (motels/hotels, care facilities)	0.40 ERUs/unit

	Commercial/industrial	1.00 ERUs/unit

	Irrigation systems	0.50 ERUs/unit

13.70.170 Capacity credit—Water and wastewater.

A.    Calculation of Credit. A fee credit associated with the assessment of the general facility charge may be given subject to petition by the property owner or developer for the value of off-site mitigation or improvements related to the providing of additional capacity beyond the requirements necessary to meet the property owner or the developer requirements, which benefit the utility system. The credits shall be proportional to the additional capacity provided by the planned capital improvement.

B.    Limit on Credit. The total credit, if any, as provided in this subsection shall not exceed the amount of the total general facility charge due and payable to the utility that applies to the property or development requiring service as a result of the improvements. (Ord. 2018-15 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2002-29 § 2 (part), 2002)

“Average daily traffic” means the amount, in vehicle trips per day, accommodated on a specific city roadway.

“Average daily trips” means the number of trips generated by a proposed project.

“Background traffic” means the volume of nonproject related traffic that is projected to occur on the street system as of the anticipated date of occupancy of any development.

“Capacity” means the number of vehicles that may pass over a section of a transportation facility in a given time period under the prevailing roadway or intersection conditions. The calculation of capacity for any given transportation facility will be done according to the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) or by alternative methods approved by the city engineer.

“Certificate of concurrency” means a written document prepared by the city engineer stating that a particular development meets the concurrency requirements of this chapter.

“Concurrency or concurrent with the development” means adequate transportation facilities or strategies needed to maintain the city’s adopted level of service standards on any roadway or at any intersection are available when the impacts of development occur, or that a financial commitment is in place to complete the facilities or strategies within six years. This definition includes the two concepts of “adequate transportation facilities” and “available transportation facilities” as defined above.

“Concurrency test” means the determination of a proposed development’s impact on transportation facilities by a comparison of the level of service (LOS) of the affected roadways and intersections after testing for the impact of the proposed development, to the level of service standard, as adopted by the city’s comprehensive plan for those roadways or intersections.

“Concurrency trip capacity balance sheet” means the document created and maintained by the city to record the available capacity, reservations of capacity, and the balance of the available capacity that has been adjusted to reflect reserved trips.

Development. For purposes of this chapter, “development” means any construction or expansion of any building, structure or use, or any change in the use of any building, structure or land, where the construction, expansion, or change will result in additional vehicle traffic on the transportation facilities within the city.

“Development approval” means any authorization issued by the city that approves any development, including, but not limited to, preliminary plat approval, site plan approval, planned residential development, planned mixed use development, conditional use permit approval, and building permit approval.

“Development permit” means any written authorization of the city that authorizes commencement of development.

“Financial commitment” means a source of public or private funds or combinations thereof have been identified which will be sufficient to finance transportation facilities necessary to support development and that there is reasonable assurance that such funds will be timely put to that end.

“Fully funded transportation improvement” means a project in the most recently adopted transportation capital improvement program for the city that has sufficient revenues secured as a financial commitment for construction within six years. Unsecured revenues include those from unformed local improvement districts, insufficient developer contributions, or revenues not yet committed for expenditure by outside agencies.

“Level of service (LOS)” means a measure that describes the operational condition of the transportation system and acceptable adequacy requirements. Poulsbo’s transportation levels of service are set forth in the transportation element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan and consist of six alphabetical categories corresponding to various volume-to-capacity ratios. Transportation facilities to which the level of service standard applies include both intersections and roadways, and different methods of calculating level of service apply to each type of facility.

Poulsbo Trip Generation. The “Poulsbo trip generation” is the number of citywide trips in the most current transportation functional plan and included as an appendix to the Poulsbo comprehensive plan. It is based on existing baseline traffic, projected growth and development and is the basis for transportation planning.

Reserve or Reservation. “Reserving trips” means tracking the number of trips for a proposal or development and setting them aside on the city’s trip balance sheet which prevents the same capacity from being assigned to any other applicant. Reserved trips expire with the project expiration.

“Transportation capital facilities” means capital facilities related to streets and roads.

“Transportation strategies or transportation demand strategies (TDM)” means strategies aimed at changing travel behavior rather than expanding the committed road network to meet travel demand. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, the promotion of work hour changes, narrowing roadways, parking policies, telecommuting, deployment of stop signs, and providing pedestrian bulb-outs.

5.    Developments with final approval prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


14.04.040 Concurrency required.

In order to be approved, all development that is subject to this chapter shall be required to meet concurrency. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


14.04.050 Available capacity for concurrency.

A.    The city shall determine the available capacity for concurrency as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section and record it in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet. The available capacity shall be based on the difference between the existing plus reserved trips and the Poulsbo trip generation established in the transportation element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan.

B.    The city shall update the available capacity in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet within twelve months of any of the events listed below:

1.    Update or amendment of the city’s transportation element as it relates to concurrency management.

2.    Citywide traffic volume increases by thirty percent compared to traffic volume at the time of the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet was created, or was updated with new data from traffic model.

3.    More than fifty percent of the available capacity in the most recent calculation of available capacity has been reserved as a result of concurrency tests conducted by the city.

C.    If none of the events listed in subsection B of this section occurs within seven years of the most recent calculation of the available capacity, the city will update the available capacity recorded in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet.

D.    Each update of available capacity in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet shall carry forward the reservations of capacity for any permits for development that has not been completed prior to the update of available capacity. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


14.04.060 Review of development proposals – Concurrency testing process.

A.    All proposed developments that are subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be reviewed for concurrency as part of the development review process. The process for review is outlined in Figure 14.04.060 below.

1.    Projects, developments, and/or permits generating less than three hundred average daily trips shall need to submit the project concurrency application. This application will verify sufficient trips remain in the city’s trip balance sheet.

2.    Projects, developments, and/or permits generating more than three hundred average daily trips shall need to submit the project concurrency application as well as a traffic impact analysis investigating impacts to streets and intersections at the p.m. peak and total average daily traffic. This test must meet the provisions of Section 14.04.070. The traffic impact analysis should look for areas which fall below the LOS standards set forth in the transportation element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan.

3.    The city engineer, or his/her designee, retains authority to require a project of any size to submit a traffic impact analysis.

B.    Concurrency testing shall be performed only for the specific property, uses, densities, and intensities based on information provided by the applicant. When an applicant changes the uses, densities, or intensities associated with an application in such a way as to create additional impacts on the city’s transportation facilities, a new concurrency test will be required.

C.    In the event that the city uses an outside consultant to conduct the concurrency test, the applicant shall be required to pay all consultant fees and costs incurred in connection with such testing. The applicant shall sign an agreement in a form approved by the city and shall deposit an amount estimated by the city engineer to be sufficient to defray the consultant fees and costs prior to the conduct of any concurrency test. Failure to sign the required agreement and to make the required deposit within the time required by the city engineer shall result in the application losing its priority in the first-come, first-served system of concurrency testing and the application shall be placed back in line as of the date of receipt of the signed agreement and fees.

D.    In conducting the concurrency test, standard trip generation rates, such as those reported by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, latest edition, shall be used; or other data sources prepared by a professional engineer and allowed by the city engineer.

14.04.070 Issuance of concurrency certificate.

A.    A concurrency certificate shall be granted if there are sufficient trips remaining in the city’s trip balance sheet and the requirements of subsection B of this section are met.

B.    A concurrency certificate shall be granted if the results of the concurrency test show that the volume of traffic resulting from the development proposal, when added to the background traffic volumes on all affected city roadways and at all affected city intersections:

1.    Would not cause the level of service on any city roadway or city intersection to degrade below the LOS standard described in the transportation element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan; or

2.    Where existing facilities already have adopted LOS F as identified in the transportation element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan and mitigated as required by Section 14.04.100(B); or

3.    Where new trips cause a level of service decrease to a failing level of service in a location which is identified on the six-year CIP, and the applicant demonstrates the six-year CIP will mitigate the impacts; or

4.    Where new trips cause a level of service decrease in a location which is not identified on the six-year CIP but the applicant constructs necessary improvements to correct LOS deficiency prior to final plat recording or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first.

C.    If no acceptable mitigation is proposed or agreed to as required by this section, or if the LOS cannot be preserved or protected from further degradation, the concurrency certificate shall not be issued. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


14.04.080 Time limit on concurrency certificate.

A concurrency certificate shall also expire automatically if a development application for which a certificate has been issued expires or is withdrawn, or if a development permit to which a certificate pertains is revoked. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


14.04.090 Reservation of availability capacity results of concurrency test.

A.    Upon passing a concurrency test, the city shall reserve capacity on behalf of the approved project or permit.

B.    A reservation of available capacity shall be in accordance with Section 14.04.080.

C.    A reservation of available capacity is valid only for the uses and intensities authorized for the issued development permit. Any change in use or intensity is subject to an additional concurrency test of the possible impact on transportation facilities.

D.    A reservation of available capacity is nontransferable to another parcel of land or development approval or permit. A reservation of available capacity may be transferred to a subsequent purchaser of the land for the same use and intensities. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


14.04.100 Mitigation.

A.    If required, the applicant, or applicant’s traffic engineer, shall propose a mitigation measure for review. City retains the right to have third party peer review the mitigation measures. Applicant shall submit financial deposits if required by the city. The city shall:

1.    Approve mitigation measures as set forth by applicant.

2.    Approve mitigation measures with conditions.

3.    Deny mitigation measures.

B.    Roadway segments and intersections with adopted LOS F in the transportation element of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan may require mitigation measures which address impacts associated with adoption of the LOS F standard, but do not necessarily add capacity. Mitigation measures may include transportation demand management (TDM) or transportation system management (TSM) actions or projects such as:

1.    Transit and nonmotorized facilities.

2.    Signal timing optimization.

3.    Other measures which encourage shifts from single occupancy vehicles. (Ord. 2016-08 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)

14.06.010 Vision.

The city of Poulsbo recognizes that promoting pedestrian, bicycle, and public transportation travel reduces negative environmental impacts, promotes healthy living, advances the well-being of travelers, supports the goal of compact development, promotes economic development, and helps meet the needs of the diverse populations that comprise our communities. The city of Poulsbo’s vision is of a community in which all residents and visitors, regardless of their age, ability, or financial resources, can safely and efficiently use the public right-of-way to meet their transportation needs regardless of their preferred mode of travel. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.020 Policy.

The city will to the maximum extent practicable plan for, design, construct, operate, and maintain an appropriate and integrated transportation system that will meet the needs of all users including pedestrians, bicyclists and transit passengers of all ages and abilities, as well as trucks, buses and automobiles. The concept of complete streets includes but is not limited to transportation facilities such as road signs, pavement markings, street and sidewalk lighting, sidewalk and curb ramps complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act, transit accommodations, bicycle accommodations, speed control features, and streetscapes which promote pedestrian use. Recognizing that transportation needs vary, the system’s design will be consistent with and supportive of local neighborhoods, commercial areas, downtown cores and other areas and must be balanced in a flexible, safe, and cost effective manner. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.030 Project planning.

Those involved in the planning and design of projects within the public right-of-way will give consideration to all users and modes of travel from the start of planning and design work. Transportation improvements shall be viewed as opportunities to create safer, more accessible streets for all users. This shall apply to new construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation. Particular attention should be given to projects which have the opportunity to enhance the overall transportation system and its connectivity for access to parks or recreation areas, schools, shopping/commercial areas, government facilities, public transportation, employment centers, existing pedestrian or bicycle networks, or regional bicycle pedestrian plans prepared by other associated groups. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.040 Community context.

Implementation of the policies in this chapter shall take into account the goal of enhancing the context and character of the surrounding built and natural environments in accordance with the standards established in the city’s comprehensive plan, transportation plan and other adopted plans and policies. The city shall strive to continue to engage the citizens of Poulsbo in decision making and shaping policy in the implementation of complete streets in the city. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.050 Exceptions.

Exceptions to the requirements of this chapter, including for eligible private development projects, may only be granted by the city council after review and recommendation by the city’s public works committee except under the circumstances listed below:

A.    Ordinary maintenance activities such as mowing, snowplowing, sweeping, spot repair, joint or crack sealing, or pothole filling do not require that elements of this policy be applied beyond the scope of that maintenance activity; however, ordinary maintenance paving projects should include evaluating the condition of existing facilities supporting alternate transportation modes as well as modifying existing pavement markings and signage that supports such alternative modes as appropriate.

B.    Street reconstruction projects and maintenance paving projects which involve widening pavement may exclude elements of this policy at city engineer discretion when the accommodation of a specific use is expected to:

1.    Require more space than is physically available; or

2.    Drastically increase project costs and equivalent alternatives exist within close proximity; or

3.    Have adverse impacts on environmental resources such as streams, wetlands or floodplains above and beyond the impacts of currently existing infrastructure; or

4.    The cost would be disproportionate to the current need or probable future use.

C.    Street projects may exclude the development of sidewalks in areas falling outside those identified as appropriate for sidewalks in the city’s adopted standards. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.060 Intergovernmental cooperation.

The city will cooperate with other transportation agencies including the Washington State Department of Transportation and Kitsap County to ensure the principles and practices of complete streets are embedded within their planning, design, construction, and maintenance activities. The city will cooperate to ensure to the maximum extent practicable the transportation network flows seamlessly between jurisdictions in accordance with local and regional road, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian plans. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.070 Design criteria.

The city shall continue to maintain and update design and construction criteria, standards and guidelines based upon recognized best practices in street design, construction and operation. These criteria, standards and guidelines shall encourage the implementation of a complete and well connected context-sensitive transportation network. Resources to be referenced in developing and applying these standards include, but are not necessarily limited to, the latest editions of standards such as: American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, Washington State Department of Transportation Design Manual, Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Roadway Design Standards, the Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.080 Performance measures.

The city shall put into place performance standards with measurable benchmarks to evaluate the complete streets policies for success and opportunities for improvement. These standards may include documentation of public participation, facilities constructed or improved and the number of exceptions to this policy approved. An annual report shall be prepared for the city’s public works committee to track these standards. The city shall work toward establishing a multimodal level of service standard. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)


14.06.090 Implementation.

The city shall continue to incorporate complete streets principles in city comprehensive plans, codes and other regulations. The city should also continue to pursue grant funding for projects that employ complete streets elements to improve existing city infrastructure for all users. (Ord. 2017-16 § 1 (part), 2017)

Chapter 15.08 OUTDOOR SOUND SYSTEMS

Sections:

15.08.010    Declaration of purpose and necessity.

15.08.020    Definitions.

15.08.030    Outdoor sound system use prohibited.

15.08.040    Exemptions.

15.08.050    Amortization and removal of existing public systems.


15.08.010 Declaration of purpose and necessity.

The city council finds and declares that the quiet enjoyment of individual properties is an important aspect of the environment of Poulsbo. Proliferation of outdoor speakers at public businesses has over time increased to the degree that the council finds that outdoor sound systems are negatively impacting both the residential and commercial environment of the city. The city council further finds that despite repeated warnings and requests for cooperation, business owners have failed to voluntarily limit the volume utilized in such systems to prevent the disturbance of adjacent properties. The council further finds that many reasonable alternatives to the use of outdoor sound systems in commercial enterprises such as pagers and other individual devices to alert salesmen are readily available on the market at a reasonable price. Therefore this chapter has been enacted in order to prohibit outdoor sound systems and establishing an amortization period for existing systems. (Ord. 92-20 § 2 (part), 1992)


15.08.020 Definitions.

The following definition shall be applied in this chapter:

“Outdoor sound system” includes electronic systems designed and intended for the amplification of the human voice, music or other sound or noise including but not limited to outside public address systems, voice amplification and any other form of loud speaker. (Ord. 92-20 § 2 (part), 1992)


15.08.030 Outdoor sound system use prohibited.

Except as provided in Section 15.08.040, no person shall install, maintain or operate an outdoor sound system on or from any property. (Ord. 92-20 § 2 (part), 1992)


15.08.040 Exemptions.

The following uses or activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter:

A.    Private outdoor sound systems accessory to a residential use in a residential zone of the city, provided, however, that said residential outdoor sound systems shall not be operated at a volume audible beyond the boundaries of the property on which they are operated.

B.    Mobile sound systems installed in vehicles and automobiles operated on public rights-of-way. This exemption shall not apply to vehicles while stopping, standing or otherwise at rest on public or private property.

C.    Outdoor sound systems operated in conjunction with a duly licensed public event.

D.    Intercoms. An intercom is a two-way communication system with a microphone and loudspeaker at each station for localized use. This exemption includes intercoms used by banks and fast food restaurants to communicate with customers and security devices used in apartment buildings to screen visitors. Intercoms shall comply with the limitations imposed by Section 9.70.060(B)(7) which prohibits the loudspeaker portion of the intercom from being audible off of the lot on which it is located. (Ord. 93-10 § 1, 1993; Ord. 92-20 § 2 (part), 1992)


15.08.050 Amortization and removal of existing public systems.

Any outdoor sound system in existence at the date the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective may be maintained and operated until December 31, 1992. The city council finds that reasonably priced alternatives to the use of outdoor sound systems exist and that an amortization period in excess of ninety days will provide users existing systems with a reasonable opportunity to obtain other alternative methods of communication with sales staff and others and complete reasonable economic use of existing facilities. Nothing in this chapter should be interpreted to authorize the use of a sound system at a level which would be audible off the property in violation of the provision of Section 9.70.060(B)(7) of this code. (Ord. 92-20 § 2 (part), 1992)

15.24.010 Purpose.

This chapter is to:

A.    Promote the public health, safety and general welfare;

B.    Reduce the loss of life and property damages associated with flooding;

C.    Minimize public expenditures for flood control projects and rescue and relief operations; and

D.    Assure continued availability of flood insurance. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 79-24 § 1, 1979)


15.24.020 Definitions.

Unless specified in this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application:

A.    “Appeal” means the request for the review of the city engineer’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

B.    “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist and the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. Velocity flow in such zones may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

C.    “Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the floodplain within the community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation of these areas on maps always includes the letters A or V.

D.    “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year and is also referred to as the one-hundred-year flood. Designation of these areas on maps always includes the letters A or V.

E.    “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

F.    “Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

G.    “Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include (but are not limited to) schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

H.    “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

I.    “Elevation certificate” means the official form (FEMA Form 086-0-33) used to track development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with the community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance premium rate with Section B completed by community officials.

J.    “Elevated building” means for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, post, piers, pilings, or columns.

K.    “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the adopted floodplain management regulations.

L.    “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

M.    “Flood or flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1.    The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of service waters from any source.

N.    “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

O.    “Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood-floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

P.    “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

Q.    “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of Section 15.24.230.

R.    “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

S.    “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

T.    “New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

U.    “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of adopted floodplain management regulations.

V.    “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle:

1.    Built on a single chassis;

2.    Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

W.    “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

X.    “Structure” means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

Y.    “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

Z.    “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which exceeds or equals fifty percent of the market value of the construction either:

1.    Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2.    If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct pre-cited existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been previously identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or

2.    Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historical Places or the State Inventory of Historical Places.

AA.    “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner which would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 

BB.    “Water dependent” means a structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2005-27 §§ 1, 2, 2005; Ord. 87-20 § 1, 1987: Ord. 79-24 § 2, 1979)

Article IV. Variances, Appeals and Violations


15.24.270 City council to hear and decide.

The city council shall decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. All appeals must be brought by filing a written notice of appeal with the city council within fourteen days of the engineer’s decision. Any appeal not brought within this time period is barred. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 87-20 § 14, 1987: Ord. 79-24 § 4.4, 1979)


15.24.280 Factors to be considered.

In passing upon applications for variances from the requirements of this chapter, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

A.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

B.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

C.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

D.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

E.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

F.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

G.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

H.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

I.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

J.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport from the floodwaters and effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

K.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 87-20 § 15, 1987: Ord. 79-24 § 4.4-1(1), 1979)


15.24.285 General considerations for variances.

A.    Variances from the elevation standards set forth in this chapter will generally be limited to new construction and substantial improvements which are to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level; provided, that the requirements of Section 15.24.280 are met.

B.    Variances shall pertain to a physical piece of property. Variances are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, its economic or financial circumstances. Variances shall primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods.

C.    Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except those of subsection A of this section, and otherwise complies with Sections 15.24.170 through 15.24.180. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 87-20 § 16, 1987)


15.24.290 Conditions.

Upon consideration of the factors in Section 15.24.280 and the purpose of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 79-24 § 4.4-1(2), 1979)

15.24.340 Variances—Issuance standards.

Variances shall only be issued upon:

A.    Showing of a good and sufficient cause;

B.    Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicants; and

C.    A determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 79-24 § 4.4-2(4), 1979)


15.24.350 Variances—Notice of effect and risk.

Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 2017-05 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 79-24 § 4.4-2(5), 1979)

D.    The applicant shall agree to indemnify, defend and hold the city harmless from any and all claims for bodily injury or property damage that may arise out of or in connection with the applicant’s permitted use.

E.    The technical committee may require the applicant to secure and maintain in force throughout the duration of the permit comprehensive general liability insurance for personal injury and property damage if the technical committee determines that such insurance is appropriate based upon the nature of the use and the risk involved. If such insurance is required, the amount of the insurance shall be approved by the finance director. The insurance shall name the city as an additional named insured and shall include a provision prohibiting cancellation of the policy except upon thirty days prior written notice to the city.

F.    Such other conditions as the technical committee deems necessary to reasonably ensure that the requested use does not in any way create a likelihood of endangering those who are lawfully using the public right-of-way. (Ord. 88-29 § 1 (part), 1988; Ord. 85-18 § 4, 1985)


15.28.040 Conditions.

2.    The use becomes for any reason dangerous, or any structure or obstruction permitted becomes insecure or unsafe.

B.    If any use or occupancy for which the permit has been revoked is not immediately discontinued upon the date of revocation, the planning director or his designee may remove any structure or obstruction or cause to be made such repairs upon the structure or obstruction as may be necessary to render the use secure and safe, the cost and expense of which shall be assessed as a personal obligation of the permittee, including all professional fees associated with enforcement of the collection of the same, and shall also be a personal obligation of the permittee. (Ord. 85-18 § 7, 1985)


15.28.070 Appeals.

A.    Any decision of the technical committee with respect to the issuance or refusal to issue a permit or the revocation or suspension of a permit may be appealed to the city council by filing a notice of the intent to appeal such decision with the city clerk within ten days of the date of issuance of the decision being appealed.

In addition, each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by any such person constitutes a separate infraction. The planning director or his designee may remove any structure or obstruction constructed, placed or erected on the public right-of-way without benefit of a right-of-way use permit, the cost and expense of which shall be assessed as a personal obligation of the person constructing, erecting or placing such structure or obstruction.

15.30.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe rules and regulations for exercise of the authority to enter into street and utility latecomer agreements granted to the city by Chapters 35.72 and 35.91 RCW. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.020 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, the terms listed below shall be defined as follows:

A.    “Cost of construction” means those costs incurred specifically for improvements eligible to the latecomer for design, acquisition of right-of-way and/or easements, construction, materials and installation required in order to create an improvement which complies with city standards. Until such time as Chapter 35.72 or 35.91 RCW is amended to expressly authorize inclusion of interest charges or other financing costs, such expenses shall not be included in the calculation of construction costs. In the event of a disagreement between the city and the applicant concerning the cost of the improvement, the city engineer’s determination shall be final.

B.    “Latecomer agreement” means a written contract between the city and one or more property owners providing for construction of water or sewer facilities and/or construction or improvement of street projects and for partial reimbursement to the party causing such improvements to be made of a portion of the costs of such improvements by owners of property benefitted by the improvements, as more specifically described in Chapters 35.72 and 35.91 RCW.

C.    “Street project” shall have the meaning specified in RCW 35.72.020(1) as it now reads, or as hereafter amended.

D.    “Water or sewer facilities” shall have the meaning specified in RCW 35.91.015 as it now reads, or as hereafter amended. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2007-50 § 3, 2007; Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.030 Minimum project size.

A.    In order to be eligible for a latecomer agreement, the estimated cost of the improvement must not be less than five thousand dollars. The cost of the improvement shall be determined by the city engineer, based upon a construction contract for the project, bids, engineering or architectural estimates, receipts or other information deemed by the city engineer to be a reliable basis for determining cost.

B.    Latecomer agreements may be applied for before and/or after construction of the street project or water or sewer facility is complete. Applicants that submit applications after utility project or facility construction bear the risk that the city council may reject or modify the terms of the latecomer agreement. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)

C.    For applications submitted after construction of a street project or water or sewer facility is completed, receipts and itemized construction costs must be submitted to establish the costs directly associated with construction of the street project or water or sewer facility. Itemized construction costs shall include only eligible items and shall be clearly separated from other costs incurred during construction;

D.    Scaled and clearly reproducible vicinity drawing, stamped by a civil engineer or land surveyor licensed in the state of Washington depicting the improvements, their location, the proposed benefit area including dimensions and county assessor’s numbers for each tax parcel, and size of parcels;

E.    An assessment roll containing the county assessor’s tax parcel numbers, owners of record, mailing addresses for owners of record, legal descriptions and the proposed latecomer assessment for each parcel;

F.    Evaluations for determining benefits and such other information as the city engineer determines is necessary to properly review the application; and

G.    A deposit for mailing costs and recording fees in an amount determined by the city engineer. Any unused funds shall be refunded to the applicant. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2003-16 § 40 (part), 2003: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)

15.30.060 City engineer’s determination—City council.

A.    The city engineer shall review all applications and shall approve the application only if the following requirements are met:

1.    The project satisfies the minimum size requirement of Section 15.30.030;

2.    The proposed improvements fall within the description of “street projects” and/or “water or sewer facilities” as those terms are described in Chapters 35.72 and 35.91 RCW; and

3.    In the case of street projects, the construction of the improvements is required by city ordinances as a prerequisite to development of property owned by the applicant.

B.    In the event all of the above criteria are not satisfied, the city engineer may condition approval as necessary in order for the application to conform to such criteria, or shall deny the application. The final decision of the city engineer shall be in writing. The applicant may obtain a review of the city engineer’s decision by filing a request therefor with the city clerk no later than ten days after mailing of a copy of the city engineer’s determination to the applicant at the address listed on the application.

C.    In reviewing a city engineer’s determination, the city council shall apply the criteria set forth in this chapter and Chapters 35.72 and 35.91 RCW as now or hereafter amended. The council may adopt, reject or modify the engineer’s determination. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.070 Determination of benefitted area boundaries and assessments.

In the case of all applications which are approved, the city engineer shall define an assessment reimbursement area based upon a determination of which parcels, in the case of a utility improvement, did not contribute to the original cost of the water or sewer facility and who may subsequently tap into or use the same, including not only those who may connect directly thereto, but also those who may connect to laterals or branches connecting thereto. In the case of street projects, the assessment reimbursement area shall be based upon a determination of which parcels of property adjacent to the improvements would have been required to construct similar street improvements as a condition of development had it not been for the construction which is the subject of the latecomer agreement. The amount of the assessment shall be established so that each property will be assessed a share of the costs of the improvements, which is proportional to the benefits which accrue to the property. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.080 Notice to affected property owners—Hearing, final determination by city council.

A.    The preliminary determination of area boundaries and assessments, along with a description of the property owner’s rights and options, shall be forwarded by certified mail to the property owners of record within the proposed assessment area shown on the records of the Kitsap County assessor.

B.    If any property owner requests a hearing in writing within twenty days of the mailing of the preliminary determination, a hearing shall be held before the city council, notice of which shall be given to all affected property owners by mail not less than ten days prior to the hearing.

C.    In the event a hearing is conducted as provided in this section, after considering public testimony, the city council shall make a final determination of the reimbursement area boundaries and assessments based upon the criteria set forth in this chapter and as specified in Chapters 35.72 and 35.91 RCW as now or hereafter amended. The council may adopt, reject or modify the engineer’s determination. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.090 Latecomer agreement must be recorded.

In order to become effective, a latecomer agreement must be recorded with the office of the Kitsap County auditor no later than thirty days after the latecomer agreement is signed by all parties. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.100 Written agreement—Payment of city costs in excess of application fee.

A.    Upon approval of the application and the determination of the estimated costs, benefitted area and assessments by the city engineer, the finance director shall prepare a latecomer agreement. The agreement, application and supporting documents, together with the city engineer’s determination of costs, benefitted area and assessments, shall be presented to the city council with a request that the city council approve the latecomer agreement and authorize the mayor to sign the agreement on behalf of the city. The city council may approve, reject or modify the latecomer agreement. Upon approval by the city council, the finance director shall acquire the signatures of all other parties and record the agreement as required by Section 15.30.090.

B.    In the event that costs incurred by the city for engineering or other professional consultant services required in processing the application exceed the amount of the application fee, the city’s finance director shall so advise the city council and council approval shall be conditioned upon receipt of payment by the applicant of an amount sufficient to compensate the city for its costs in excess of the application fee as set forth in Section 3.12.010(D). (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2003-16 § 40 (part), 2003; Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.110 Construction and acceptance of improvements—Recording of final assessment.

A.    When an application is made prior to construction of the street project or water or sewer facility and the reimbursement agreement has been signed by all parties and all necessary permits and approvals have been obtained, the applicant shall construct improvements and, upon completion, request final inspection and acceptance of the improvements by the city, subject to any required obligation to repair defects. When deemed appropriate by the finance director, a bill of sale, easement and any other documents needed to convey the improvements to the city and to ensure right of access for maintenance and replacement shall be provided, along with documentation of the actual costs of the improvement and a certification by the applicant verifying the actual costs and that all of such costs have been paid.

B.    In the event that actual costs are less than the costs determined by the city engineer in calculating the assessments by ten percent or more, the city engineer shall recalculate the assessments, reducing them accordingly, and shall cause a revised list of assessments to be recorded with the county auditor. (Ord. 2018-21 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 95-4 § 1 (part), 1995)


15.30.120 Collection of assessments—No liability for failure to collect.

A.    Subsequent to the recording of a latecomer agreement, the city shall:

1.    In the case of a street project agreement, collect payment at time the developer would have been required to install similar improvements in order to develop the property. To the city, this means latecomer payment shall be collected:

a.    Prior to recording final plat for subdivisions;

b.    Prior to issuing certificate of occupancy for commercial or multifamily developments;

c.    As otherwise specified in the agreement.

2.    In the case of a water or sewer facility agreement, collect payment before the city authorizes connection to the utility. The city shall collect payment prior to issuing first applicable permit which authorizes connection to the utility. To the city, this means latecomer payment shall be collected:

a.    Prior to issuance of clearing and grading permits in the case of subdivisions and site plans;

b.    Prior to issuance of public property construction permit if clearing and grading permit is not required;

c.    Prior to issuance of building or plumbing permit.

B.    Upon receipt of any reimbursement funds, the city shall deduct an administrative fee of two hundred fifty dollars, and remit the balance of such funds to the party entitled to the funds pursuant to the agreement. In the event that, through error, the city fails to collect a required reimbursement fee prior to issuance of development approval or connection to a sewer or water facility, the city shall make diligent efforts to collect such fee, but shall under no circumstances be obligated to make payment to the party entitled to reimbursement, or in any other way be liable to such party, unless such reimbursement fee has actually been paid to the city.

This chapter shall be liberally interpreted and construed to secure the public health, safety, morals, and welfare, to implement the city of Poulsbo comprehensive plan, and to comply with all applicable requirements of Washington State law, and the rule of strict construction shall have no application. (Ord. 2019-12 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2019)


15.35.040 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases shall have the following meanings:

“Applicant” means the individual, partnership, association or corporation applying for a permit to do the work under this chapter, and includes property owners, employees, agents, consultants, contractors and successors in interest.

“Blazing” means minor nonvehicular cutting or removal of vegetation, including trees, shrubs or groundcover, sufficient for line-of-site surveying and foot access trails to the extent that the site is not otherwise significantly disturbed.

“City arborist” means the city of Poulsbo designated contract arborist. When required or determined necessary, the planning director shall consult with the city arborist. All costs associated with review by the city arborist shall be the responsibility of the applicant of the tree cutting or clearing permit.

“Class IV forest practice activity” means a timber harvest, thinning or other activity as established by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources Forest Practices Regulations (Chapter 76.09 RCW), whereby a property owner is allowed to harvest a limited amount of timber from their property within the city limits, while still maintaining the right to convert the property to a use inconsistent with growing timber.

“Clearing” means any tree cutting, clearing or removal of vegetation in any manner exceeding the extent of blazing as defined above.

“Cutting” means the felling or removal of a tree, or any procedure in which the natural result will lead to the death or substantial destruction of a tree. Such acts include but are not limited to the severe cutting back of limbs, and damage inflicted upon the root system of the tree. Cutting does not include normal pruning within the bounds of accepted arboricultural practices.

“Dead, Dying and Dangerous Trees.” See Section 15.35.120.

“Development” means land-disturbing activity or the addition or replacement of impervious surface. Development also includes buildings, structures, parking and loading areas, landscaping, pavement.

“Diameter at breast hight (DBH)” means a tree’s diameter in inches at four and one-half feet above the ground. On multi-stemmed or -trunk trees, the diameter shall be the diameter equivalent to the sum of trunk areas measured at four and one-half feet above the ground.

“DNR” means Washington State Department of Natural Resources.

“Drip Line.” The drip line of a tree is located by the vertical projection of a line at the tips of the outermost branches.

“Fully developed” means: (1) any individual lot or parcel, which may not be further subdivided or developed, that is presently occupied by one or more buildings over one hundred twenty square feet in floor area in usable condition; (2) any street or utility right-of-way that has been constructed to at least minimum city standards; (3) park lands that are currently managed and maintained for public use which include landscaped areas, trails or recreational facilities.

“Groundcover” means any plant matter less than three feet in height occurring above the soil layer.

“High Grading.” In forestry, high grading is a selective type of timber harvesting that removes the highest grade of timber (i.e., the most merchantable stems) in an area of forest. The stunted, slow growing or poorly formed trees that are left as residuals will, if ecological conditions permit, reseed the space that has been created. Over time the practice of high grading can therefore give rise to forest stands containing stems of less value in terms of timber quality.

“Land-disturbing activity” means any activity resulting in a movement of earth, or a change in the existing soil cover, both vegetative and nonvegetative, or the existing topography. Land-disturbing activities include, but are not limited to, tree removal, grading, filling, excavation, or addition of new or the replacement of impervious surface. Vegetative maintenance practices are not considered land-disturbing activities.

“Land use review” means an approval procedure for a specific use or development required under Title 16, 17 or 18.

“Limbing” means removal of branches and leaving at least two-thirds of the existing tree branch structure. Limbing does not include topping of trees.

“Owner” means the owner of record for real property as shown on the tax rolls of Kitsap County, or a person purchasing a piece of property under contract.

“Partially developed land” means any individual lot or parcel, which may be further subdivided, that is presently occupied by one or more buildings over one hundred twenty square feet in usable condition.

“Permittee” means the person or entity to whom a permit is issued for tree cutting or clearing purposes.

“Person” means any individual, partnership, co-partnership, firm, company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, government entity, or any other legal entity; or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns. This definition includes all federal, state or local government entities.

“Planning director” means the city of Poulsbo planning and economic development department director or authorized designee.

“Pruning” means cutting back of limbs larger than one and one-half inches in diameter. Pruning shall conform to the International Society of Arboriculture standards, or other standards approved by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and/or the Department of Ecology (DOE), to maintain trees within environmentally critical areas and shoreline areas in a healthy and safe condition.

“Review authority” means the person or body responsible for interpreting and/or directing a land use permit or activity, and as set forth in Title 19, Project Permit Application Procedures.

“Routine landscape maintenance” means lawn mowing, composting, gardening, tree limbing and groundcover maintenance that does not include tree removal and is undertaken by a person in connection with the normal maintenance and repair of the property.

“SEPA” means State Environmental Policy Act (see Chapter 16.04).

“Site” means the defined portion of any lot(s) or parcel(s) of land or contiguous combination thereof, where tree cutting or clearing is performed or permitted.

“Thinning” means the removal of trees less than eighteen inches DBH where removal will improve the growth of remaining trees or removal of diseased trees that might otherwise die.

“Topping” means the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree.

“Tree” means a living woody plant characterized by one main stem or trunk and many branches and having a diameter of six inches or more measured at DBH or is generally referred to in the nursery and landscape industry as a tree.

“Undeveloped land” means: (1) any lot or parcel not presently occupied by one or more buildings over one hundred twenty square feet in usable condition; (2) any street or utility right-of-way which is not currently opened and constructed to minimum city standards.

“Vegetation” means plant matter, including trees, shrubs and groundcover.

“Vegetation removal” means the act of removing vegetation by digging up, cutting down or any act which is likely to cause vegetation to die within a period of five years, including but not limited to damage inflicted to the root system by machinery, storage of materials, or soil compaction, change to the ground level in the area of the root system; damage inflicted on vegetation permitting infection or infestation, excessive pruning or any other action which is deemed harmful to vegetation.

15.35.090 Class IV general forest practices.

A.    This chapter is intended to allow the city of Poulsbo to assume jurisdiction for approval of general forest practices, approvals occurring in the city of Poulsbo, as authorized under the Washington State Forest Practices Act, Chapter 76.09 RCW.

B.    Lands within the city limits and Poulsbo urban growth area (UGA) are not considered appropriate for long term timber production and harvesting, which takes a full forty-year cycle. Forest management activities shall be consistent with the city’s comprehensive land use plan and implementing regulations for the UGA. Forest practice applications shall meet the requirements specified in subsections C and D of this section.

C.    Conversion of properties within the UGA can reasonably be expected, therefore, significant land clearing of such properties shall only take place at the time of a valid land use application. Tree tracts, open spaces and buffers can then be properly coordinated with the actual development plans. Conversion of the land to nontimber production shall occur when the city has approved a land use development permit for the site. Significant (seven thousand one square feet or more of clearing and/or disturbance) clearing or harvesting is not allowed until conversion occurs.

D.    For Class IV general forest practices, maintenance and thinning of existing timber stands is allowed to promote the overall health and growth of the stand until the area is converted. A tree cutting and clearing permit shall be required for any maintenance and thinning and shall be reviewed by the city arborist. High grading or top-down thinning shall not be permitted. The remaining trees should be healthy, long-term trees from the dominant and co-dominant crown classes. The stand shall be marked prior to the selective thinning operation, indicating which trees will be removed and retained. (Ord. 2019-12 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2019)

Consultation with the planning and economic development department is required for any tree cutting, tree topping, tree trimming, pruning, thinning and/or vegetation clearing within a critical area, critical area buffer, shoreline and shoreline buffer. A critical areas or shoreline permit may be required for such activities under certain circumstances. Consultation requirements and special critical area permits are provided for in Chapters 16.08, Shoreline Master Program, and 16.20, Critical Areas. (Ord. 2019-12 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2019)


15.35.110 Trees and vegetation in open space tracts, tree retention tracts and other protective areas.

A.    Trees located in open space tracts, tree retention tracts, or other protected areas may only be removed if the tree is dead, dying, or dangerous and poses potential hazard to persons or property. See Section 15.35.120 for provisions to remove dead, dying or dangerous trees.

B.    A tree cutting and clearing permit is required for tree removal in these protective areas.

C.    Replanting is required. Replacement trees shall conform to the original planting installation or as approved by the planning director.

1.    Tree replacement shall be determined according to the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the tree removed, upon consultation with the city arborist.

2.    The location of the replacement tree(s) shall be on the property where the tree was removed, unless approved otherwise by the planning director upon consultation with the city arborist.

3.    If any replacement tree dies within three years of the planting, the tree shall be replaced in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 2019-12 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2019)


15.35.120 Dead, dying or dangerous trees.

A.    For purposes of this section:

1.    “Dead” means the tree is lifeless.

2.    “Dying” means the tree is in an advanced state of decline because it is diseased, infested by insects or rotting and cannot be saved by reasonable treatment or pruning, or must be removed to prevent the spread of the infestation or disease to other trees.

3.    “Dangerous” means the condition or location of the tree presents a clear public safety hazard or a foreseeable danger of property damage to an existing structure and such hazard or danger cannot reasonably be alleviated by treatment or pruning.

B.    Removal of dead, dying or dangerous trees is allowed. If the removal is seven thousand one square feet or more of disturbed area, or is located within an open space tract, tree retention tract, required landscaping, designated critical area (including buffers) and other protective areas, a tree cutting and clearing permit shall be required.

C.    When a permit is required per subsection B of this section, a qualified arborist or landscape architect shall provide written verification which states the removal is essential for the protection of life, limb or property. The planning director may consult with the city arborist to assist in the review of the submitted written verification when deemed necessary.

D.    The planning director, upon consultation with the city arborist, may determine that dead or dying trees be retained in critical area, critical area buffer, tree retention tract, open space tract or other protected areas, in order to provide for wildlife habitat and natural processes, unless the tree presents a potential hazard to person or properties. (Ord. 2019-12 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2019)


15.35.130 Performance standards.

e.    The responsible official will normally respond to a request for early notice within ten days. The threshold determination will normally be made within fifteen days of receipt of the changed or clarified proposal, environmental checklist and/or permit application.

C.    Definitions. As used in this section:

1.    “Days” means calendar days; and

2.    A completed application for a threshold determination consists of the following information:

a.    For proposals requiring a permit or license for which an application is otherwise required by city ordinance, a complete application for such permit or license meeting all requirements for such application specified by the said ordinance or administrative procedures, and 

b.    A completed environmental checklist, and 

c.    Such additional information as may be required by the responsible official pursuant to all WAC 197-11-335. (Ord. 92-23 § 1, 1992: Ord. 84-43 § 8, 1984)

16.04.100 Categorical exemptions—Determination.

A.    When the city receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals a department initiates a proposal, the responsible official shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter shall apply to the proposal.

B.    In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible official shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental license required. If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the responsible official shall determine the lead agency even if the license application that triggers the consideration is exempt.

C.    If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:

1.    The city shall not give authorization for:

a.    Any nonexempt action, 

b.    Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact,

c.    Any action that would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives;

2.    The city may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if the nonexempt actions were not approved; and

3.    The city may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if the nonexempt actions were not approved. (Ord. 84-43 § 10, 1984)


16.04.110 Threshold determination—Early review.

A.    If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other licenses that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications.

B.    In addition to the environmental documents an applicant shall submit the following information for early environmental review:

1.    Site plan;

2.    Circulation plans showing access and egress;

3.    Utility locations;

4.    Topography;

5.    Building heights;

6.    Lighting;

7.    Buffering;

8.    Other information as the responsible official may determine. (Ord. 84-43 § 11, 1984)


16.04.115 Optional DNS process.

A.    If the responsible official has a reasonable basis for determining that significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely, the responsible official may elect to use the single integrated comment period set forth in this section. If this process is used, a second comment period will typically not be required when the DNS is issued.

B.    If the optional process set forth in this section is used, the responsible official shall:

1.    State on the first page of the notice of application that it expects to issue a DNS for the proposal, and that 

a.    The optional DNS process is being used, 

b.    This may be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposal, 

c.    The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared, and 

d.    A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific proposal may be obtained upon request (in addition, the city may choose to maintain a general mailing list for threshold determination distribution);

2.    List in the notice of application the conditions being considered to mitigate environmental impacts, if a mitigated DNS is expected;

3.    Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public notice in RCW 36.70B.110; and

4.    Send the notice of application and environmental checklist to:

a.    Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal, and

b.    Anyone requesting a copy of the environmental checklist for the specific proposal (in addition, the city may choose to maintain a general mailing list for checklist distribution).

C.    If the responsible official indicates on the notice of application that a DNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status during the comment period on the notice of application in accordance with Section 16.04.050 of this chapter and WAC 197-11-948.

D.    The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice of application and either:

1.    Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with no comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section;

2.    Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with a comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section, if the responsible official determines a comment period is necessary;

3.    Issue a DS; or

4.    Require additional information or studies prior to making a threshold determination.

E.    If a DNS or mitigated DNS is issued under subsection D(1) of this section, the responsible official shall send a copy of the DNS or mitigated DNS to the Department of Ecology, agencies with jurisdiction, those who commented, and anyone requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental checklist need not be recirculated. (Ord. 2000-29 § 7, 2000)


16.04.120 Threshold determination—Environmental checklist.

A.    A completed environmental checklist shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not exempted by this chapter. The checklist shall be in the form of WAC 197-11-960 with such additions that may be required by the responsible official in accordance with WAC 197-11-906(4).

B.    A checklist is not needed if the city and the applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency.

C.    The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

D.    For private proposals, the applicant is required to complete the environmental checklist. The city may provide assistance as necessary. For city proposals the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

E.    The city may decide to complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if any of the following occurs:

1.    The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant;

2.    The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration;

3.    Upon request of the applicant, at the applicant’s cost. (Ord. 84-43 § 12, 1984)


16.04.130 Threshold determination—Mitigated DNS.

A.    The responsible official may issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B.    An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely. The request must:

1.    Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency;

2.    Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C.    The responsible official’s response to the request for early notice shall:

1.    State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific areas of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS;

2.    State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, and may revise the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D.    When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal.

1.    If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a determination of nonsignificance if the city determines that no additional information or mitigation measures are required.

2.    If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3.    The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures, clarifications, changes or conditions must be in writing and must be specific.

4.    Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

E.    1. A mitigated DNS is issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a fourteen-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application.

2.    The city shall not act upon a proposal for which a mitigated DNS has been issued for fourteen days after the date of issuance.

F.    Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the licensing decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit or enforced in any matter specifically prescribed by the city. Failure to comply with the designated mitigation measures shall be grounds for suspension and/or revocation of any license issued.

G.    If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigation DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) relating to the withdrawal of a DNS.

H.    The city’s written response under subsection C of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarification or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 2000-29 § 9, 2000; Ord. 84-43 § 13, 1984)

A.    All development, activities and uses within the shoreline jurisdiction shall require a shoreline substantial development permit, shoreline conditional use permit, and/or a shoreline variance, unless exempted according to the requirements of Sections 16.09.040, 16.09.050 and 16.09.060.

B.    All shoreline uses and development shall be located and designed in a manner that ensures no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and minimizes adverse impacts to natural shoreline resources and wildlife habitat, including fish and aquatic habitat. 

C.    All shoreline development and uses impacting ecological functions shall be mitigated according to the mitigation sequence established in WAC 173-26-201(2)(e), except as otherwise specified in this chapter. This mitigation sequence requires that potential impacts shall first be avoided if possible; if avoidance is not possible, the anticipated impact shall be minimized; and any impacts that remain after reviewing for avoidance and minimization shall be mitigated.

D.    Shoreline development and uses shall be approved according to the following priority: water-dependent, water-related, water-enjoyment, non-water-oriented.

E.    In addition to the requirements of this chapter, critical areas within the shoreline jurisdiction shall be protected according to the requirements of the critical areas ordinance, Chapter 16.20. If there are any conflicts between the critical areas ordinance and this chapter, the more stringent requirement shall apply.

F.    Where specific regulations for a proposed development, activity or use are not provided, the development, activity or use shall utilize best management practices to minimize any adverse impacts to water quality and natural shoreline resources.

G.    Disruption of natural shoreline resources, including clearing and grading, tree removal, and erosion protection, shall be the minimum necessary to accommodate the approved use or activity.

H.    In evaluating permit applications for proposed development, activities or uses along the shoreline, the city shall consider the long-term and regional effects of the proposal on natural shoreline resources and the ability of future generations to enjoy and use the shoreline. Any negative long-term and regional effects shall be mitigated in accord with the mitigation sequencing requirements of Section 16.08.140. Failure to comply with the mitigation sequencing requirements may result in permit denial.

I.    New development shall be located and designed to avoid the need for future shoreline stabilization to the extent feasible.

J.    New development must have adequate access, utilities and public services. 

K.    When development, activities or uses are proposed on a property or properties that are partially located in the city’s shoreline jurisdiction, the relevant shoreline permit or exemption application and any other required applications shall address the entire property or properties and the complete development proposal, both inside and outside of the shoreline jurisdiction. The applicant shall address protection of shoreline resources from nonshoreline activities and development, impacts of proposed nonshoreline land uses on protected critical areas and buffers, including the area within the shoreline buffer and setback area, and indicate any potential incompatibilities between proposed nonshoreline and shoreline uses.

L.    Proposals for new and expanded shoreline development and uses shall be evaluated for cumulative impacts to shoreline values and functions, per WAC 173-26-201(3)(d)(iii). (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.130 Federal and state approvals.

A.    All work at or waterward of the OHWM may require permits or approvals from one or more of the following state and federal agencies: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Washington Department of Natural Resources, or Washington Department of Ecology. It is an applicant’s responsibility to determine which federal or state permits may apply to a development proposal, and to obtain them. 

B.    Nothing in this chapter shall relieve an applicant from applying for and obtaining any necessary permits or approvals described in subsection A of this section. If an applicant does not provide documentation verifying that all such permits and approvals have been received prior to issuance of a permit or exemption under this chapter, the city may condition such permit or exemption upon the applicant obtaining all other required permits or approvals, and may require that such permits or approvals must be obtained before a city building permit will be issued. 

C.    If there are any conflicts between local, state and federal requirements or conditions, the more stringent requirement or condition shall apply and shall be documented in the city’s approved shoreline permit, unless otherwise indicated in this chapter. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.140 Mitigation and sequencing requirements.

A.    Development and activities are required to mitigate impacts to shoreline habitat and other environmental impacts, to meet the standard of “no net loss” of shoreline ecological functions as directed in WAC 173-26-186(8) or its successor. To ensure that proposed actions are consistent with the no net loss provision by avoiding, minimizing and mitigating for adverse impacts, an applicant for a development or activity where impacts are anticipated (including but not limited to all over-water uses or shoreline modifications) shall complete a mitigation analysis utilizing mitigation sequencing as defined in Section 16.08.040 during design, construction and operation, in a manner consistent with WAC-173-26-201(2)(e) or as subsequently amended.

B.    If a mitigation analysis reveals that unavoidable impacts will result from the proposed development or activity, a habitat mitigation plan shall be prepared according to the requirements of WAC 173-26-201(2)(e) and 197-11-660 to ensure no net loss of shoreline habitat values and functions or impacts to priority species. If critical areas will be impacted, the requirements of the city’s critical areas ordinance, as indicated in Section 16.08.060, shall also be addressed in the mitigation plan.

C.    Failure to demonstrate that the mitigation sequencing standards have been met may result in permit denial, or the city may restrict or reduce development or land uses, or impose additional conditions. Additionally, the city may request that the applicant submit studies by qualified professionals, or that submitted studies, mitigation analysis and/or habitat mitigation plan be peer-reviewed by qualified professionals, at the applicant’s expense in order to determine compliance with these standards. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.150 In-water construction and development activities.

The following standards shall apply to in-water work, including, but not limited to, installation of new structures, repair of existing structures, restoration projects, and aquatic vegetation removal. 

A.    In-water structures and activities shall be sited and designed to avoid the need for future shoreline stabilization and nonmaintenance dredging, with special emphasis on protection of critical saltwater habitat and species, and submerged aquatic vegetation.

B.    Removal of existing structures shall be accomplished so that materials from the structure do not enter or remain in the water.

C.    Waste material and unauthorized fill, such as construction debris, concrete, bricks, asphalt, metal, tires and any other similar material upland or below the OHWM shall be removed.

D.    No toxic or deleterious materials, including but not limited to petroleum products, hydraulic fluid, cement, tires, or chemicals, are allowed to enter or leach into the water during in-water construction. Sedimentation and turbidity during construction shall comply with state and federal water quality requirements and any associated permit conditions. Appropriate spill clean-up materials must be on site at all times, and any hazardous material or oil spills must be contained and cleaned immediately, and reported immediately to the Department of Ecology and to the city, as specified in Section 16.08.160(C)(6).

E.    In-water work shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes turbidity and causes little or no siltation to adjacent areas. A sediment control curtain and/or other appropriate best management practice (BMP) shall be used in those instances where siltation can reasonably be expected. Work shall be conducted using BMPs for the protection of water quality, including the use of debris booms, silt curtains or other control measures, singly or in combination, which shall be maintained and operated to provide compliance with required state and federal water quality standards. 

F.    Any trenches, depressions or holes created below the OHWM shall be backfilled.

G.    Fresh concrete or concrete by-products shall not be allowed to enter the water at any time during in-water installation. All forms used for concrete shall be completely sealed to prevent the possibility of fresh concrete from entering the water.

H.    Alteration or disturbance of the bank and bank vegetation shall be limited to that necessary to perform the in-water work. All disturbed areas shall have appropriate erosion control measures installed, and shall be restored according to an approved mitigation plan.

I.    If at any time as a result of in-water work, water quality problems develop, immediate notification shall be made to the Department of Ecology and to the city.

J.    Materials used for over-water decking, in-water construction, or other structural components that may come into contact with water shall comply with regulations of responsible agencies (e.g., Department of Fish and Wildlife or Department of Ecology) to avoid leaching of toxic chemicals. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.160 Water quality.

A.    The location, design and management of shoreline development and activities shall not degrade the quality or quantity of surface and groundwater on or adjacent to the site. All federal and state water quality and effluent standards shall be met.

B.    Submittal Requirements. All proposals for development activity or construction, including clearing, grading and fill, shall submit for approval a stormwater site plan, unless exempted by the public works official. The stormwater site plan shall include:

1.    Provisions for temporary erosion control measures; and

2.    Provisions for stormwater detention, water quality treatment and stormwater conveyance facilities, in accordance with the city’s adopted stormwater management manual in effect at the time of permit application.

C.    Standards. 

1.    New or expanded shoreline development shall comply with the standards established in the city’s adopted stormwater management manual in effect at the time of permit application.

2.    New or expanded shoreline development and activities shall apply best management practices (BMPs) consistent with the city’s adopted stormwater management manual, to minimize any increase in surface water runoff and to control, treat and release surface water runoff so that receiving properties, wetlands or streams, and Liberty Bay are not adversely affected. All types of BMPs shall be regularly maintained for continual functioning as intended.

3.    Low impact development techniques shall be considered and implemented to the greatest extent practicable, consistent with the city’s adopted stormwater management manual.

4.    If a new stormwater outfall or discharge pipe to Liberty Bay is demonstrated to be necessary, it shall be designed so that the outfall and energy dissipation pad is installed above the OHWM, unless otherwise demonstrated to be infeasible.

5.    In addition to providing stormwater quality treatment facilities as required in this section, for new or expanded shoreline development and activities the developer and/or property owner shall provide source control BMPs designed to treat or prevent stormwater pollution arising from specific activities expected to occur on the site. 

6.    No release of oils, hydraulic fluids, fuels, paints, solvents or other hazardous materials or chemicals shall be permitted into Liberty Bay. If water quality problems occur on a site, including equipment leaks or spills, work operations shall cease immediately and the Department of Ecology shall be immediately notified. The responsible party shall initiate a full and rapid response to contain and clean up a leak or spill. The public works department and other agencies with jurisdiction shall be contacted immediately to coordinate spill containment and cleanup activities. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to fund and implement the containment and cleanup activities. The person or company responsible for a spill of oil or hazardous substances into state waters may be required by the state or city to fund a natural resource damage assessment, pay a penalty for violation of state or city laws or rules, and/or reimburse the state’s or city’s expenses to respond and investigate the incident. 

7.    See Sections 16.08.150(D), (G) and (J) regarding restricted materials that may not come into contact with the water of Liberty Bay and Dogfish Creek estuary.

8.    The application of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers shall comply with the following standards:

a.    The application of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers within the shoreline setback shall utilize Best Management Practices for Landscaping and Lawn/Vegetation Management Section of the 2005 Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, or its successor as adopted by the city, to prevent contamination of surface and ground water and/or soils, and adverse effects on shoreline ecological functions and values.

b.    Pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers shall be applied to upland areas in a manner that minimizes their transmittal to adjacent water bodies. The direct discharge of these chemicals into adjacent water bodies is prohibited. Spray application of pesticides shall not occur within one hundred feet of open waters, including wetlands, streams and any channel that leads to open water except when approved by the city.

c.    The use of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers within the shoreline jurisdiction, including applications of herbicides to control noxious or invasive aquatic vegetation, shall comply with the regulations of responsible state and federal agencies, including any permitting requirements.

D.    On-Site Sewage Systems. 

1.    All new development within the shoreline jurisdiction shall connect to the city sewer system. 

2.    If an existing shoreline residence is located within two hundred feet of a city sewer line that can accept new residential connections, the residential structure may not be expanded unless it is connected to the city sewer system. 

3.    If the Kitsap County health district certifies that an on-site sewage system is failing or is inadequate for the property it serves, development on the entire property shall be connected to city sewer if a city sewer line is within two hundred feet of any building on the property that is connected to the on-site sewage system. Replacement or repair of a failing or inadequate system shall only be allowed if city sewer is not available within two hundred feet, and the health district confirms that a new on-site system will function correctly based on such factors as the property’s size, soils, and topography. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)

Article III. Shoreline Development, Uses and Activities


16.08.170 Shoreline environment designations.

Environment designations are applied to all of the city’s shoreline areas based upon habitat characterization, land use, and location of shoreline buffers. Within the city’s jurisdiction, these include: shoreline residential-1 (SR-1), shoreline residential-2 (SR-2), high intensity (HI), urban conservancy (UC), natural (N) and aquatic (A), as shown on the city’s adopted shoreline maps. The shoreline environment designations do not change or replace the underlying zoning of the affected properties, although they provide more specific requirements and limitations for shoreline uses and modifications in a manner similar to a zoning overlay. Management policies for each environment are in the city’s adopted shoreline master program policies and the comprehensive plan. The environment designations are as follows: 

A.    Shoreline Residential (SR). The shoreline residential environment is intended to accommodate residential development consistent with the city’s shoreline management standards; protect ecological functions and natural habitat, and restoration when feasible; and provide public access and recreational uses, where appropriate. The shoreline residential environment is divided into two subdesignations: shoreline residential-1 (SR-1) and shoreline residential-2 (SR-2).

The SR-1 environment primarily includes those areas of the shorelands waterward of the established shoreline buffer, and/or on the water side of “buffer interruptions” such as major roads. 

The SR-2 environment primarily includes those areas of the shorelands outside of the established shoreline buffer, and/or on the upland side of “buffer interruptions,” such as major roads. Within these areas, new residential development is permitted according to the applicable shoreline and zoning development standards, with an emphasis on transition from the preservation-oriented focus of SR-1 to adjacent residential development located outside of the shoreline jurisdiction. 

SR-1 includes the following areas: 

1.    In the Fjord Drive planning segment, the areas of the shoreline residential environment located on the west (waterward) side of Fjord Drive.

2.    In the Front Street planning segment, areas of the shoreline residential environment that are located either west (waterward) of the shoreline buffer line or on the west (waterward) side of Front Street.

3.    In the western planning segment, the areas of the shoreline residential environment located east (waterward) of the one-hundred-foot shoreline buffer line.

SR-2 includes the following areas: 

1.    In the Fjord Drive planning segment, the areas of the shoreline residential environment located on the east side of Fjord Drive.

2.    In the Front Street planning segment, areas of the shoreline residential environment that are located either east of the shoreline buffer line or on the east side of Front Street.

3.    In the estuary planning segment, the areas of the shoreline residential environment located on the east side of Bond Road.

4.    In the western planning segment, the areas of the shoreline residential environment located west of the one-hundred-foot shoreline buffer line.

B.    High Intensity (HI). The high intensity (HI) shoreline environment provides for those areas of existing moderate commercial and mixed commercial/residential development. This environment allows for optimum use of shoreline areas that are presently developed with commercial uses, while seeking opportunities to protect habitat and ecological functions from further degradation. The identified HI areas include the downtown waterfront and an area near the head of Liberty Bay.

C.    Urban Conservancy (UC). The urban conservancy (UC) shoreline environment preserves existing natural landforms and native shoreline vegetation as much as possible, while promoting public shoreline access, views and recreation along with continuance of existing developed uses. The UC designation applies to several shoreline properties located at the west side of the intersection of Lindvig Way and Bond Rd, adjacent to the Dogfish Creek estuary. 

D.    Natural (N). The natural (N) shoreline environment is established to protect and restore shoreline areas that are relatively free from human influence, undeveloped, and/or include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions that are sensitive to proposed impacts from development. N areas within the city include the majority of Fish Park, and areas of Muriel Iverson Waterfront Park, Net Shed Park, American Legion Park and Nelson Park, that are within zero to one hundred feet of the ordinary high water mark of Liberty Bay and/or the estuarine portion of Dogfish Creek.

E.    Aquatic (A). The aquatic (A) shoreline environment includes the water and lands waterward of the ordinary high water mark within the city’s jurisdiction, including public and private tidelands, state submerged lands, and areas designated as critical saltwater habitat, and the estuarine portion of Dogfish Creek. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.180 Shoreline use table.

A.    The shoreline use table below indicates appropriate shoreline uses in each of the city’s environmental designations, subject to restrictions indicated in Sections 16.08.190 through 16.08.320, and is applicable to the following:

1.    New development, uses or activities. This does not include normal maintenance or repair.

2.    Redevelopment according to Section 16.08.040(59) of a conforming structure of the same size and within the same footprint as the existing structure. If redevelopment of a nonconforming structure is proposed, the nonconformance regulations in Article VI of this chapter shall apply. 

3.    Expansion of an existing development, use or activity above that existing as of the effective date of this master program.

4.    A change of use between categories of uses as indicated in A. through J. in the shoreline use table.

B.    The following requirements apply to all proposed uses, activities and developments:

1.    Uses, activities or development not listed in this section or Section 16.08.190 shall be considered “unclassified” and shall be reviewed and processed as conditional uses.

2.    If there is any conflict between the shoreline use table and the written provisions of this chapter, or between this chapter and other city regulations, the more stringent requirement or regulation shall apply unless otherwise indicated in this chapter. 

3.    Permitted or conditionally permitted uses or development are allowed only where the underlying zoning also allows such uses or development. For more specific requirements or restrictions pertaining to each use, refer to Title 18 (Zoning Ordinance).

C.    Shoreline modifications are addressed in Article V, Shoreline Modifications.

Shoreline Use Table  

The table is coded according to the following legend:

P = Permitted, when meeting requirements for that use and shoreline environment; may be subject to shoreline substantial development permit, minor shoreline development permit or shoreline exemption requirements. See Chapter 16.09 for substantial development permit and minor development permit requirements.

C or MC = Conditional use or minor conditional use, when approved by the city and the Department of Ecology. See Chapter 16.09 for conditional use and minor conditional use permit requirements.

V = Development may be allowed with a shoreline variance in order to permit reasonable use of the property, through a shoreline buffer and/or setback reduction or other reduction in dimensional standards, per WAC 173-27-170, in addition to any other required shoreline permit or exemption.

X = Prohibited; the use is not eligible for a variance or conditional use permit.

N/A = Not applicable in the specific environment, due to the intrinsic nature of the use. For example, a boat slip can only be located in an aquatic environment.

16.08.190 Shoreline uses prohibited in all environments.

The following uses are prohibited in all shoreline environments:

A.    Agriculture.

B.    Airplane runway (other than authorized runway in Liberty Bay), storage or service facilities.

C.    Helicopter landing, storage or service facilities.

D.    Floating homes.

E.    Forest practices.

16.08.200 Shoreline development and use standards—All environments and uses.

The following standards in this section apply to all development, uses and activities within the shoreline zone that are commenced, constructed, altered or expanded after the effective date of this shoreline master program:

A.    Shoreline Buffers and Setbacks.

1.    For the shorelines of Liberty Bay, the shoreline buffer extends one hundred feet from the OHWM. For the Dogfish Creek estuary, the buffer shall be one hundred fifty feet (Type 3 stream buffer), as measured from the OHWM or top of bank of that portion of Dogfish Creek within the shoreline jurisdiction, whichever is greater. In general, activities and structures that are not for a water-dependent, water-related, public recreation or public access use are not permitted within a shoreline buffer.

2.    The buffer setback for Liberty Bay and the Dogfish Creek Estuary extends twenty-five feet from the outer edge of the buffer. In general, development activities may be permitted in a shoreline buffer setback, but structures that are not for a water-dependent or public access use may not be located within it.

3.    Buffer and buffer setback areas shall be measured landward on the horizontal plane.

4.    Uses and development that may be allowed within the A environment or shoreline setback and buffer area include water-dependent or water-related development and uses, public access and recreation facilities, and reasonable use of a highly constricted shoreline property, subject to other restrictions in this chapter and the city code.

B.    When calculating lot size, lot coverage, yard setbacks or density, any land area located waterward of the OHWM, such as tidelands, shall not be included. 

C.    Where strict compliance with the shoreline buffer or buffer setback would result in a regulatory taking of the property based on its zoning and environment designation, a shoreline variance application to reduce the size of the buffer or buffer setback may be submitted pursuant to the requirements of Section 16.09.170. However, land located entirely waterward of the OHWM, such as tidelands, has no vested development rights, and shall not qualify for relief from those provisions of the shoreline master program regulations preventing development on such areas of land, including but not limited to, those provisions regarding shoreline variances. 

D.    Public viewsheds and designated public view corridors, as identified according to Section 16.08.360, shall be protected and preserved in all shoreline environment designations.

E.    Parking.

1.    New development shall provide the required amount of off-street parking and loading as required by the city zoning standards, or as otherwise indicated in this chapter.

2.    When an existing structure is expanded, additional residential units are added, and/or its use is changed per Section 16.08.180(A), additional off-street parking and loading shall be provided for the increased gross floor area and/or additional units as required by the city zoning standards, or as otherwise indicated in this chapter. 

F.    Mooring or anchoring (with or without a buoy) on state lands outside of designated harbor areas shall comply with the requirements of WAC 173-26-241(3)(c)(viii) or its successor, and other relevant state law pertaining to time limitations for temporary moorage. 

G.    New shoreline development or redevelopment by public entities, including local governments, port districts, state agencies, and public utility districts, shall include public access unless such access is shown to be incompatible due to reasons of safety, security, or impact to the shoreline environment. 

H.    New construction of structures waterward of the OHWM shall be limited to locations outside of critical saltwater habitat per WAC 173-26-221(2)(iii)(C) and structures that are permanently limited to water-dependent uses, and it shall be demonstrated that it is essential for the water-dependent use to have the structure located in the critical saltwater habitat area, either in or over the water, in order for the water-dependent use to function correctly. Also see Article V of this chapter, Shoreline Modifications.

I.    No new development or redevelopment shall be permitted within the stream channel or floodway of Dogfish Creek unless it meets the following exceptions: public access for recreational purposes per Section 16.08.290(D); public utilities, public roads and associated development per Section 16.08.310; or habitat restoration and enhancement activities per Section 16.08.470. Existing structures within the stream channel or floodway that do not meet these exception criteria may be maintained but not expanded, and removed or destroyed structures may not be replaced. Such structures are not eligible for a shoreline variance for expansion or replacement, or for any other exceptions under the nonconforming structures regulations of this chapter. Also see Article VI of this chapter, Nonconformances. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.210 Land division and boundary line adjustments.

The creation of new lots or altered lots through subdivision or boundary line adjustment shall comply with the following requirements, in addition to the requirements of Title 17:

A.    New lots are prohibited in the following circumstances when the lot would not be able to accommodate development or provide a sufficient buildable area consistent with the zoning and environment designation of the lot: 

1.    Where a new lot would not have sufficient buildable area outside geologically hazardous areas;

2.    Where a new lot would be entirely located within the A, N, UC or SR-1 environment, or would not have sufficient buildable area located outside of these environments;

3.    Where a new lot would require a critical areas permit or variance to obtain a sufficient buildable area;

4.    Where a new lot would be located entirely within the one-hundred-year floodplain adjacent to the shoreline or streams within the shoreline jurisdiction, or would not have a sufficient buildable area located outside of the one-hundred-year floodplain.

B.    In the SR-2 and HI environments, new lots shall contain sufficient buildable area located outside of the shoreline buffer and buffer setback to accommodate development consistent with the environment designation and zoning.

C.    The alteration of existing lots through a boundary line adjustment shall not create new nonconformities or increase existing nonconformities.

D.    New shoreline subdivisions resulting in more than four parcels shall comply with the requirements of WAC 173-26-221(4)(d)(iii).

On sites where shoreline views are available, commercial, multifamily residential, mixed use and recreational development that is newly constructed, redeveloped, or has its gross building floor area expanded by more than fifty percent after the effective date of this master plan is required to have the relevant new construction or expansion comply with the following design requirements, to enhance the ability of residents, visitors and the public to enjoy the physical and aesthetic benefits of the shoreline. Any other design standards that are relevant to the location, zone or use, such as those in the zoning code, shall also apply.

A.    Buildings shall be designed with windows oriented toward the shoreline.

B.    Buildings shall be designed to incorporate outdoor areas such as decks, patios or viewing platforms oriented toward the shoreline.

C.    Buildings shall be designed with entrances along the waterfront facade, and with connections between the buildings and any private or public walkways along or to the shoreline.

D.    Service areas, refuse and recycling containers, storage and equipment shall be located away from the shoreline, to the extent feasible, and shall be screened from public view from the water, adjacent properties, and public right-of-way.

E.    Buildings shall not incorporate materials that are reflective or mirrored.

F.    Within the HI environment, development in the downtown core commercial overlay zone shall also comply with the downtown core design requirements in Title 18.

G.    For new construction, where feasible the location of required public view corridors shall be designed concurrently with building orientation, to maximize both public views and views from the proposed development. If there is a conflict between building orientation and the location of required or existing public view corridors, the public view corridor shall take precedence. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.340 Signage.

The following regulations apply in addition to any other city requirements, including sign regulations in the zoning code for prohibited, exempt and temporary signs. If there is a conflict between other sign regulations and the regulations of this section, the more stringent regulation shall apply.

A.    Signs shall be located on the same property or within the same development as the business or organization being advertised. Off-site advertising signs, including commercial billboards, are prohibited. 

B.    Freestanding signs may be allowed within the shoreline buffer and setback for water-dependent and water-related development and uses that are also located in the buffer and/or setback area, including on-site directory and public information signs, and for public access and park interpretative and directional signage, subject to the following requirements:

1.    Signs are limited to five feet in height from the ground level and twenty square feet in area.

2.    Signs shall not obscure or block designated public view corridors.

6.    Lighting associated with the U.S. Coast Guard’s Navigation Safety Requirements, such as navigation aid beacons. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.360 Public viewsheds and public view corridors.

The city does not establish, protect or maintain views from private property. However, public views of the shorelines and water on both public and private property shall be designated and maintained to enhance the public’s ability to see and enjoy the shorelines and waters of Liberty Bay. 

A.    Within the two-hundred-foot shoreline jurisdiction, the city has established public viewsheds from the following public streets and public properties to the Liberty Bay shoreline:

1.    Front Street, extending from Bond Road south to Hostmark Avenue;

2.    Fjord Drive, extending from Hostmark Avenue south to the city limit;

3.    Lindvig Way;

4.    East of Viking Avenue, from Lindvig Way south to the city limit;

5.    Public parks.

B.    Intent. The intent of the viewshed designation is to promote an aesthetically attractive view of Liberty Bay and the shoreline environment from public parks and major public streets near the shoreline, with limited visual obstruction from buildings and other structures. 

C.    Applicability. 

1.    The requirements in subsections (C)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply to any property of one acre or greater in size, excluding tidelands, where views of the shoreline are available. For the purposes of this section, “property” shall mean the total area included in a development proposal, which may involve one or more lots or parcels. This section shall not apply to redevelopment of a structure of the same size and within the same footprint as the existing structure.

2.    Within designated viewsheds, when a new development is proposed that requires preliminary plat, site plan, planned residential development, planned urban development or binding site plan review (such as a new commercial development, a residential development of four or more units, or a mixed use development), one or more view corridors shall be established where the corridor can meet the standard of subsection (D(2) of this section. 

3.    Within designated viewsheds, when an existing structure is expanded or the site is redeveloped to contain more than fifty percent over the gross building square footage existing upon the effective date of this shoreline master plan, one or more view corridors shall be established where the corridor can meet the standard of subsection (D)(2) of this section.

D.    Standards.

1.    Within a new or expanded development that requires establishment of view corridors per subsections (C)(2) and (3) of this section, buildings and structures shall be clustered to provide and maintain a maximum-width contiguous public view corridor from the relevant street or park.

2.    A view corridor shall be a minimum of twenty feet wide or thirty percent of the total average property width, whichever is greater, unless the planning director determines that this requirement would result in a regulatory taking of the property based on its zoning and shoreline environment, and accepts an alternative width.

3.    Although new landscaping on properties within public viewsheds is encouraged to be designed, located and maintained for maximum retention of shoreline views, the city shall not regulate private landscaping or other private native or nonnative vegetation within a viewshed for the purposes of view preservation, except for approved view corridors.

E.    View Corridor Location. When a view corridor is required, it shall be designed to meet the following location standards and must be approved by the city planning director:

1.    If the subject property does not directly abut the shoreline, the view corridor shall be designed to coincide with any existing view corridors on properties that lie between the subject property and the shoreline.

2.    The view corridor location shall be adjacent to a side property line in order to obtain the widest view corridor in combination with adjacent properties, unless an alternative location can be shown to provide a larger and more aesthetically rewarding view, and shall consider the following criteria in order of priority:

a.    Potential impacts to critical areas.

b.    Locations of existing view corridors.

c.    Existing development or potential development on adjacent properties, given the topography, access and likely location of future improvements.

d.    The availability of actual views of the water and the potential of the property for providing those views from the relevant street or park.

e.    Location of sight-obscuring structures, parking areas or vegetation that are likely to remain in place in the foreseeable future.

3.    The view corridor shall be in one continuous piece throughout the subject property.

4.    For land divisions, the view corridor shall be established as part of the land division, either as a tract or a permanent easement across common open space which shall be maintained for public viewing benefit, recorded on the face of the plat, and located to create the largest and most aesthetically pleasing view.

5.    Where feasible and desirable, view corridors may be co-located with proposed or existing public shoreline access.

F.    Permitted Structures and Uses Within a View Corridor. The following new structures, uses and landscaping and native vegetation plantings shall be permitted within a view corridor. 

1.    Areas provided for public access and recreational facilities, such as pedestrian and bicycle pathways, playgrounds, viewing platforms and picnic areas.

2.    Structures, including below-grade structures, where the slope of the subject property allows unobstructed views of the shoreline over the structures from the street or park.

3.    Landscape plantings, including required landscaping in setbacks and buffers, provided it is of a size that will not obscure the view from the street or park to the shoreline at the time of planting or upon reaching maturity. In the event of a conflict between required new landscaping for site screening/buffering and view preservation, view preservation shall take precedence. 

4.    Native vegetation plantings to maintain or restore shoreline habitat areas; provided, that such plantings shall be of a size that will not obscure the view from the street or park to the shoreline at the time of planting or upon reaching maturity.

5.    Open fencing that is designed not to obscure the view from the street or park to the shoreline.

6.    Electric distribution lines (excluding major electric transmission lines), cable and telephone lines and similar wire facilities are permitted, but for new or expanded development and redevelopment these should be located underground whenever feasible.

7.    Surface parking that is permitted under Section 16.08.300(B), and which does not obscure the view from the street or park to the shoreline.

G.    Dedication. 

1.    For land divisions and site plans, the view corridor shall be established as part of the land division or site plan approval, either as a tract or as a permanent easement across common open space for public viewing benefit, and shall be recorded on the face of the plat or site plan. 

2.    The applicant shall execute a covenant or similar legal agreement, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, to maintain and protect the public view corridor. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.370 Public access design standards.

A.    New and expanded public access to the shoreline that is intended to meet the requirements of this chapter shall comply with the following standards:

1.    Walkways shall be designed and sited to minimize the amount of native vegetation removal, impact to existing trees, soil disturbance, and disruption of existing habitat corridor structures and functions, according to the requirements in Sections 16.08.120(B) and 16.08.140.

2.    Where feasible, walkways that are adjacent to other public shoreline access areas such as street ends, walkways, parks and other connections shall maximize the public nature and connectivity of the access.

3.    Walkways shall minimize intrusions of privacy for occupants and residents of the site, by avoiding locations directly adjacent to residential windows and outdoor private open spaces and recreational amenities.

4.    Public access shall be indicated by signs installed at each entrance to the public pedestrian walkway, and on the abutting rights-of way that lead into the development site. Signs shall be located for maximum visibility. Design, materials and mounting requirements shall meet city specifications.

5.    All public pedestrian walkways and access points shall be in a minimum six-foot-wide easement or tract, or similar legal agreement in a form acceptable to the city attorney, and recorded on the plat or site plan. Easements extending through individual lots shall have required notice on title. Land survey information for these purposes shall be provided by the applicant in a format approved by the shoreline administrator.

B.    Operation and Maintenance Requirements. The following operation and maintenance requirements apply to all new and expanded public pedestrian walkways and shoreline access points required under this section:

1.    Hours of Operation. Unless otherwise established by the shoreline administrator, all required pedestrian walkways and shoreline access points shall be open to the public between dawn and dusk. 

2.    The applicant is permitted to secure the subject property outside of the hours of operation by a security gate, subject to the following provisions:

3.    The gate shall remain unlocked and in an open position during hours of permitted public access.

C.    Signage shall be included noting the hours of permitted public access.

D.    The city planning director is authorized to approve temporary closures for maintenance and repair, or if hazardous conditions are present that would affect public safety.

E.    No certificate of occupancy or final inspection approval shall be issued until all required public access improvements are completed.

F.    The applicant, and its successor or assigns, shall be responsible for the completion and maintenance of all waterfront public walkways and access points and signage on the subject property, and shall keep these in a safe, accessible and functioning condition. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)

Article V. Shoreline Modifications


16.08.380 Shoreline modifications—General requirements.

The standards in this section apply to all shoreline modifications in the city’s shoreline jurisdiction.

A.    All shoreline modifications shall be reviewed in accordance with the avoid, minimize, mitigate sequence in Sections 16.08.120(B) and 16.08.140.

B.    Shoreline modifications shall not individually or cumulatively result in a net loss of ecological functions or habitat. Preference shall be given to those types of shoreline modifications that have a lesser impact on ecological functions and require less mitigation of identified impacts resulting from shoreline modifications. 

C.    During construction or repair work on a shoreline stabilization measure, areas of temporary disturbance within the shoreline buffer or buffer setback shall be restored as quickly as possible to their predisturbance condition or better.

D.    Shoreline banks and bluffs (steep slopes) within the shoreline buffer and setback shall not be modified to enlarge buildable area, or to provide or enhance physical support for new development or redevelopment, unless there is no other feasible method to prevent a regulatory taking of the property based on its zoning and environment designation of the property, in which case a shoreline variance shall be required. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)

(Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.420 Shoreline stabilization measures.

A.    The following table is a summary of the key requirements found in this section:

	Shoreline Stabilization Measures	Requirements

	Structural vs. nonstructural methods	Nonstructural methods are preferred, but if there is demonstrated need for structural stabilization measures to protect a principal use or structure then soft structural stabilization must be considered prior to hard structural stabilization.

	New or enlarged hard or soft shoreline structural measures (including additions and increases in size such as height, width, length or depth)	A geotechnical report is required to demonstrate need, and shall include design recommendations for minimizing structural measures and impacts to natural sediment transport.

For hard structural proposals, the geotechnical report shall also include an evaluation of the feasibility of soft vs. hard shoreline structural measures.

It must be demonstrated that the erosion is being caused by waves, tides or currents, and not by loss of upland vegetation or drainage issues.

Mitigation for habitat impacts shall be required.

	Major repair or replacement of hard or soft shoreline structural measures	A major repair is a collapsed or eroded structure or a demonstrated loss of structural integrity, or repair of toe rock or footings, and the repair is over more than fifty percent of the structure’s continuous linear length; or

A major repair is repair to more than seventy-five percent of the linear length of the structure that involves replacement of top or middle course rocks or similar repair.

A geotechnical report is required to demonstrate need, and shall include design recommendations for minimizing structural measures and impacts to natural sediment transport.

For hard structural proposals, the geotechnical report shall also include an evaluation of the feasibility of soft vs. hard shoreline structural measures.

	Minor repair of hard or soft shoreline stabilization measures	Does not meet threshold for new, enlarged, major repair or replacement measures.

No geotechnical report or needs assessment required.

B.    All new stabilization measures, and major repairs, replacement, and enlargements to existing structural stabilization shall comply with the requirements of Sections 16.08.120(B) and 16.08.140.

C.    New or Enlarged Structural Shoreline Stabilization.

1.    For the purposes of this section, enlargement of an existing structural stabilization method shall include additions to increases in size (such as height, width, length or depth). 

2.    New or enlarged structural shoreline stabilization measures shall only be allowed landward of the ordinary high water mark of Liberty Bay.

3.    The city shall only approve a new or enlarged hard or soft structural stabilization measure to protect a principal structure or shoreline use in the following circumstances:

a.    For new or enlarged hard structural stabilization, conclusive evidence, documented by a geotechnical analysis, that the primary structure or shoreline use is in danger from shoreline action caused by waves, tidal action or currents. The analysis must show that there is a significant possibility that the structure will be damaged within three years or the shoreline use will be impaired as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of hard structural stabilization measures, or where waiting until the need is immediate would result in the loss of opportunity to use measures that would avoid impacting ecological functions. 

b.    For new soft structural stabilization measures, provide narrative demonstrating need for structural stabilization to protect the principal structure or shoreline use.

c.    For hard and soft stabilization proposals, it must be demonstrated that erosion is not due to loss of upland vegetation, natural bluff sloughing, or on-site drainage.

D.    Replacement or Major Repair of Hard Structural Shoreline Stabilization.

1.    For the purposes of this section, major repair or replacement of a hard shoreline stabilization measure shall include the following activities:

a.    A repair needed to a portion of an existing stabilization structure that has collapsed, eroded away or otherwise demonstrated a loss of structural integrity, or in which the repair work involves modification of the toe rock or footings, and the repair is fifty percent or greater than the linear length of the shoreline stabilization measure; or

b.    A repair to more than seventy-five percent of the linear length of the existing hard structural shoreline stabilization measure in which the repair work involves replacement of top or middle course rocks or other similar repair activities.

2.    A major repair or a replacement of an existing hard structural stabilization measure with another hard structural stabilization measure shall only be approved to protect a principal structure, or shoreline use if not associated with a principal structure, if conclusive evidence is provided, documented by a geotechnical analysis, that the primary structure or use would be in danger from shoreline erosion caused by waves, tidal action or currents without the existing hard structural stabilization, and the repair or replacement proposal is consistent with the requirements of Section 16.08.380(B). 

E.    Minor Repairs of Hard Shoreline Stabilization. Minor repairs of hard shoreline stabilization include those maintenance and repair activities not otherwise addressed in the subsection above. The city shall allow minor repair activities to existing hard structural shoreline stabilization measures.

F.    Repair or Replacement of Soft Shoreline Stabilization and Submittal Requirements.

1.    The city shall allow repair or replacement of soft shoreline stabilization.

2.    The applicant shall provide design recommendations for minimizing impacts and ensuring that the replacement or repaired soft stabilization measure is designed, located, sized and constructed to ensure no net loss of ecological functions; and 

G.    A new, repaired or replaced soft or hard shoreline stabilization measure shall not result in significant adverse impacts to adjacent or down-current properties from changes in sedimentation or tidal impacts.

H.    The city may require peer review by a civil engineer for proposed designs for new hard shoreline stabilization. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.430 Breakwaters, jetties and groins.

Breakwaters, jetties and groins are not permitted in any shoreline environment unless associated with moorage in a marina or port facility, public access or public recreation facility, public shoreline stabilization, or another specific public purpose. In addition to compliance with the other requirements of this chapter, an approved breakwater, jetty or groin must meet the following criteria. A shoreline conditional use permit is required.

A.    The structure is essential to the safe operation of a moorage or marina facility or the maintenance of other public water-dependent uses, such as a swimming beach.

B.    The location, size, design and accessory components of the moorage or marina facility or public water-dependent use to be protected shall not result in undesirable or adverse impacts to the shoreline and aquatic environment, navigation, or nearby waterfront properties.

C.    All breakwaters, jetties or groins must be designed and constructed under the supervision of a civil engineer or other qualified engineering professional. As part of the application, the engineer shall demonstrate based on accepted industry engineering standards or guidelines that the structure is the smallest feasible structure to meet the requirements of this chapter and accomplish its purpose, and that the design will result in the minimum feasible adverse impacts upon the environment, nearby waterfront properties, and navigation. Peer review of the proposed design may be required.

D.    Breakwaters may only use floating or open-pile designs unless such a design is demonstrated to not be practicable. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.440 Dredging and dredge material disposal.

A.    A shoreline conditional use permit is required for new dredging proposals, i.e., dredging of areas that have not previously been dredged under state and/or federal dredging approvals. A shoreline substantial development permit is required for maintenance dredging of areas that have previously received state and/or federal dredging permits, such as navigational channels and marina basins. 

Maintenance dredging qualifies as normal maintenance when:

1.    There is a designated and authorized facility, such as a federal navigational channel or berth, authorized by a previously issued shoreline conditional use permit or shoreline substantial development permit;

2.    The dredging is limited to restoring previously existing contours within the channel or berth as approved in the previous permit, and does not expand the channel or berth; and

3.    The person or entity proposing the maintenance dredging demonstrates that the work is exempt to the satisfaction of the shoreline administrator. A shoreline exemption application is required.

B.    New or expanded development shall be sited and designed to avoid or, if that is not feasible, to minimize the need for new and maintenance dredging.

C.    Dredging waterward of the OHWM may be allowed only for the following purposes:

1.    To establish, expand, relocate, maintain or reconfigure navigation channels and basins where necessary for assuring safe and efficient accommodation of navigational uses and then only when significant ecological impacts are minimized and when mitigation is provided. 

2.    To establish, expand, relocate, maintain or reconfigure private or public marina facilities, water-dependent uses, or other public access uses.

3.    Maintenance dredging of established navigation channels and basins shall be restricted to maintaining previously dredged and/or existing authorized location, depth and width consistent with subsection A of this section; otherwise, the project shall be reviewed as a new or expanded dredging application.

4.    To restore ecological functions, provided the applicant can demonstrate a clear connection between the proposed dredging and the expected environmental benefits to water quality or degraded tidelands or submerged lands, native vegetation, and/or critical saltwater habitat.

5.    To obtain fill or construction material when necessary for the restoration of ecological functions. Dredging waterward of the OHWM for the primary purpose of obtaining fill or construction materials is not permitted in other circumstances. When allowed, the site where the fill is to be placed must be located waterward of the OHWM. The fill must be located with a significant in-water habitat enhancement or restoration project.

D.    Dredging that is allowed under subsection B of this section shall meet the requirements of Sections 16.08.120 and 16.08.140.

E.    Dredge materials may be deposited waterward of the OHWM of Liberty Bay only when the material is considered suitable under, and the activity is conducted in accordance with, the dredged material management program of the state department of natural resources, and in accordance with applicable state and federal permit authorizations, and is associated with a permitted in-water habitat enhancement or restoration project. Dredge materials may not be deposited in the floodway or waters of Dogfish Creek.

F.    All permitted dredging must be the minimum area and volume necessary to accommodate the existing or proposed use, and must be implemented using practices that do not exceed state water quality standards.

G.    Dredging projects shall be designed and carried out to prevent direct and indirect impacts on adjacent properties. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.450 Fill.

A.    A shoreline conditional use permit is required for fill.

B.    Fills landward and waterward shall be permitted only if the fill:

1.    Is necessary to support: water-dependent use; public access; cleanup and disposal of contaminated sediments as part of an interagency environmental cleanup plan; expansion or alteration of transportation facilities of statewide significance currently located on the shoreline, and then only upon a demonstration that alternatives to fill are not feasible; mitigation action; environmental restoration; or a beach nourishment or enhancement program;

2.    Will not result in significant damage to water quality, fish or other species, or net loss of aquatic habitat or shoreline habitat including critical saltwater habitat; and

3.    Will not adversely alter natural drainage, currents, sedimentation, or circulation patterns.

C.    Fill shall not be permitted in regulated wetlands or streams.

D.    Refuse disposal sites, solid waste disposal sites and sanitary fills are prohibited in the shoreline zone.

E.    In addition to the above requirements, a proposal to fill shall also comply with the requirements of Chapter 15.35, Grading and Clearance. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)


16.08.460 Tree and vegetation maintenance and removal.

To maintain the ecological functions that trees provide for the shoreline environment, any proposal to remove trees or other vegetation in the shoreline buffer area or in an aquatic area shall be subject to the following requirements:

A.    Significant native trees shall be retained in the shoreline buffer unless removal is required due to documented hazardous conditions, approved as part of a shoreline variance for reasonable use of property, or for approved shoreline access where no other feasible solution is available. In such circumstances, removal of significant native trees shall be subject to the requirements of subsection B of this section.

B.    Removal, pruning, thinning, limbing or cutting of native trees or native vegetation within the shoreline buffer or in an aquatic area, with the exception of normal and routine tree and vegetation maintenance within rights-of-way, utility corridors, public access points and pathways, park and recreational facilities, existing landscaped areas, and public safety purposes, shall be subject to the following standards:

1.    Existing native shoreline vegetation in an aquatic area or within a shoreline buffer shall be preserved and permanently protected, with limited exceptions to remove and/or maintain native vegetation to establish and maintain the following: water-dependent and water-related uses; public recreation and public access uses; city-approved public view corridors; and utilities and roads; or in the case of a documented hazardous condition or shoreline variance.

2.    Proposed removal of native shoreline vegetation as described in subsection (B)(1) of this section shall comply with Sections 16.08.120(B) and 16.08.140. When approved projects will result in an unavoidable loss of native shoreline or aquatic vegetation within an aquatic area or a buffer area, mitigation shall be required to ensure no net loss of shoreline habitat value and functions. Additional conditions or restrictions may apply if removal is proposed on steep slopes or unstable soils.

3.    Proposals to remove, prune, thin, limb or cut trees or native vegetation within the shoreline buffer or in an aquatic area shall be subject to the standards of the city’s clearing and grading ordinance and critical areas ordinance, and may be subject to the findings of the city arborist regarding preservation of the health and appearance of the tree(s) and surrounding native vegetation. Danger tree abatement may be achieved by felling or topping the tree. Habitat needs may require leaving the fallen tree in the riparian corridor or maintaining a high stump.

4.    Nondestructive pruning or thinning of lateral branches to preserve or enhance views, or trimming, shaping, thinning or pruning of a tree necessary to its health and growth shall be consistent with the following standards:

a.    In no circumstance shall removal of more than one-fifth of the original crown or canopy be permitted.

“Nonconforming” does not apply to uses or structures approved with a shoreline conditional use permit or a shoreline variance after the adoption of this shoreline master program, which shall be considered conforming for the purposes of this chapter.

B.    If a structure or use is nonconforming according to this chapter, that structure or use shall be subject only to the nonconforming provisions of this chapter, and not the nonconforming provisions of any other part of the city code. 

C.    For the purposes of this section, “damage” shall refer to those impacts from sudden and unforeseeable events out of the property owner’s control, such as fires or windstorms, and shall not include the gradual deterioration of a structure due to lack of maintenance or repair. 

D.    Nonconforming Shoreline Uses.

1.    A structure that houses a nonconforming use may not be expanded, redeveloped, or relocated unless the nonconforming use is eliminated.

2.    The planning director may allow a nonconforming use within a structure or site to be replaced with another nonconforming use, upon determining that:

a.    The replacement use is less intensive and will result in reduced impacts to shoreline habitat and resources; 

b.    The replacement use is consistent with the zoning code.

3.    A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned if it is discontinued for more than twelve months, and may not be resumed, unless the discontinuance was due to damage or destruction of the structure, in which case the nonconforming use may only be resumed in accordance with subsection E of this section.

4.    An over-water or in-water structure which is being used for a nonconforming use may not be expanded or redeveloped unless the use is brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter.

E.    Nonconforming Shoreline Structures.

1.    Routine maintenance and repair of legally established nonconforming structures is permissible. Repair in excess of fifty percent of a structure shall be considered restoration or rebuilding per Section 16.08.040.

2.    A nonconforming structure that is relocated within the shoreline jurisdiction shall be brought into conformance with shoreline master program and zoning regulations in effect on the date of the proposed relocation.

3.    Damage or Destruction of Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed may be restored or rebuilt subject to the following requirements:

a.    The applicant shall apply for permits needed to restore or rebuild the structure within twelve months of the date when the damage occurred. The city council may extend this twelve-month period if extenuating circumstances (e.g., insurance litigation) have prevented the applicant from applying for permits; 

b.    The restoration or rebuilding of the structure shall be complete within two years of permit issuance;

c.    If a structure located in a landslide hazard area is destroyed, it may be rebuilt only if the rebuilt structure is located outside of the landslide hazard area; 

d.    The planning director may allow a destroyed nonconforming structure to be rebuilt at another nonconforming location on the same site, upon determining that the new location of the nonconforming structure is less nonconforming and will result in reduced impacts to shoreline habitat and resources than if the structure were to be rebuilt in the original location;

e.    The structure shall be restored or rebuilt in compliance with current building code requirements and other applicable city and state regulations;

f.    All other requirements of this chapter and Chapter 16.09 shall be met; and 

g.    No net loss of shoreline habitat values or functions on the site or adjacent waters shall occur.

4.    A nonconforming structure, or a structure (conforming or nonconforming) that contains a nonconforming use or uses, may be expanded or redeveloped with a shoreline variance subject to the following requirements:

a.    No portion of the structure that is located over-water or in-water may be expanded or redeveloped;

b.    Structures or other development shall not extend further waterward; 

c.    No other nonconformities shall be created or be increased; 

d.    A variance is not needed for any other purpose;

e.    No additional or enlarged building footprint or new development area shall be located within fifty feet of the OHWM;

h.    No net loss of shoreline habitat values or functions on the site or adjacent waters shall occur.

5.    A nonconforming structure that is removed other than for reasons of damage shall not be replaced unless it is brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter.

F.    If a property owner wishes to establish the status of a primary residential structure as conforming to the shoreline master program according to RCW 90.58.620, the criteria in subsections (F)(1) and (2) of this section must be met. Nothing in this subsection exempts any residential structure from the requirement that all future development, redevelopment, expansion or alteration of the structure shall be in compliance with the provisions of this master program. Additionally, this subsection does not address other nonconformances that may exist according to the zoning code or other city regulations.

1.    The owner shall provide evidence that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning director that the structure was legally permitted and built according to all city requirements in effect at the time of building permit approval; and

2.    The structure shall not be located in a landslide hazard area. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)

Article VII. Conditional Uses and Variances


16.08.490 Conditional uses and variances.

A request for a shoreline conditional use permit or a shoreline variance shall be subject to the criteria of Chapter 173-27 WAC, and to the regulations in the city’s zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance and critical areas ordinance. Where a conflict exists between regulations, the more restrictive shall apply. An application for a shoreline conditional use permit or a shoreline variance shall be processed according to the requirements of Chapter 16.09. In addition, the following criteria shall apply in all shoreline areas:

A.    All development and uses indicated as conditionally permitted land uses in the relevant shoreline environment according to Section 16.08.190 shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

B.    A new or expanded use or development which is otherwise permitted, but which would significantly impair or alter the public’s access to or use of the waters of Liberty Bay, shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

C.    A new or expanded use or development which by its intrinsic nature may have a significant ecological impact on shoreline ecological functions or shoreline resources at a particular location, whether or not the impacts can be mitigated, shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

D.    A new or expanded use or development that is proposed in critical saltwater habitat shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

E.    Development of an undeveloped legal shoreline lot that is nonconforming (i.e., a lot which because of its size, configuration, presence of critical areas or other reason cannot meet the requirements of the zoning code, critical areas ordinance or shoreline master program requirements for development setbacks and buffers) shall require a shoreline variance. All development regulations and requirements that can be met without a shoreline variance shall be met. Development allowed through a shoreline variance shall be the minimum allowed to prevent a regulatory taking of the lot based on its zoning and shoreline environment.

F.    Nonconforming lots within the shoreline zone are not eligible for a shoreline variance to allow further subdivision. 

G.    Any habitat impacts resulting from development permitted under a shoreline conditional use permit or a shoreline variance shall be mitigated to ensure no net loss of shoreline habitat or ecological function. (Ord. 2012-10 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2012)

D.    Any conditions attached by the city to the permit approval as necessary to ensure compliance with the Act and Chapter 16.08. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.120 Minor shoreline substantial development permits (Type II).

A.    Applicable Development Activities. A development activity that does not qualify for a shoreline exemption per Section 16.09.040, but that meets one or more of the following criteria, shall be processed as a minor shoreline substantial development permit unless the planning director determines that subsection B of this section is applicable to the proposed development.

1.    Development that meets the requirements for minor site plan review in Section 18.68.020.

2.    Public access and other associated amenities (such as trails, signage, benches, educational or recreational facilities) that are located landward of the ordinary high water mark, and that do not have a fair market value of more than fifty thousand dollars.

16.09.140 General review criteria for all shoreline conditional use permits.

The requirements of this section apply to all minor shoreline conditional use permits and shoreline conditional use permits:

A.    Purpose. Per WAC 173-27-160, the purpose of a shoreline conditional use permit is to allow flexibility within the shoreline master program in the application of use regulations in a manner consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020. In authorizing a conditional use, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the city or the Department of Ecology to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use and/or to assure consistency of the project with the Shoreline Management Act and the city’s shoreline master program.

B.    Criteria for Approval. Uses which are classified or set forth in the city’s shoreline master program as conditional uses may be authorized provided that the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

1.    That the proposed use is consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the city’s shoreline master program;

2.    That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines;

3.    That the proposed use of the site and design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the city’s comprehensive plan and shoreline master program;

4.    That the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and

5.    That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

C.    Cumulative Effects. In the granting of all conditional use permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

D.    Unclassified Uses. Uses which are not classified in the city’s shoreline master program as shown on the official shoreline use table may be authorized as conditional uses, provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this section and the requirements for conditional uses contained in the city’s shoreline master program, and receives a conditional use permit for such use.

E.    Uses which are specifically prohibited by the master program may not be authorized through a conditional use permit. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.150 Minor shoreline conditional use permits (Type II).

A.    Applicable Uses. A use that is classified as a conditional use by the city’s shoreline master program shall be processed as a minor conditional use if it meets the requirements of Section 16.09.140, and if one or more of the following are met:

1.    The use will occur entirely within an existing building and involve no changes to the building exterior.

2.    The use will be associated with development activities that qualify for a shoreline exemption or a minor substantial development permit.

3.    The use does not involve any development activities, but is classified as a conditional use by the city’s shoreline master program.

B.    Review Process. A minor shoreline conditional use permit shall be processed as a Type II administrative permit application, according to the requirements of Title 19 and Chapter 173-27 WAC. The decision maker shall be the planning director, and appeals shall be heard by the city hearing examiner. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.160 Shoreline conditional use permits (Type III).

A.    Applicable Uses. A use that is classified as a conditional use by the city’s shoreline master program may be authorized if it meets the requirements of Section 16.09.140.

B.    Review Process. A shoreline conditional use permit shall be processed as a Type III quasi-judicial permit application according to the requirements of Title 19 and Chapter 173-27 WAC. The decision maker shall be the city hearing examiner, and appeals shall be heard by the city council.

C.    Approval by Department of Ecology. Shoreline conditional use permits require approval by the Department of Ecology. When the city has approved a minor conditional use permit or a conditional use permit the city will forward it to the Department of Ecology for its review and approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval according to the requirements of WAC 173-27-200. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.170 Shoreline variances.*

A.    General. This section establishes the procedures and criteria that the city will use to review and decide upon each application for a shoreline variance under the Shoreline Management Act. Chapter 16.08 establishes when a shoreline variance shall be required.

B.    Purpose of a Shoreline Variance. Under WAC 173-27-170, the purpose of a variance is strictly limited to granting relief to specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards of the shoreline master program where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the subject property such that the strict implementation of the shoreline master program would impose unnecessary hardship on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020. Variances from the shoreline use regulations of the master program are prohibited.

C.    Review Process. A shoreline variance shall be reviewed as a Type III permit pursuant to the requirements of Title 19 and Chapter 173-27 WAC. The review authority is the city hearing examiner and appeals shall be heard by the city council. If any conflict should exist between the provisions of Title 19 and this chapter, the provisions of this chapter will be followed.

D.    Criteria for Approval. WAC 173-27-170 establishes the criteria under which the city may grant a variance. Additionally, the city shall review the proposal against any relevant zoning variance criteria in Chapter 16.20 and Title 18. If there is a conflict between WAC 173-27-170 and Chapter 16.20 or Title 18, the more stringent variance criteria shall apply.

E.    Approval by Department of Ecology. Shoreline variances require approval by the Department of Ecology. When the city has approved a variance, the city will forward it to the Department of Ecology for its review and approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval according to the requirements of WAC 173-27-200. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)

(Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.190 Filing with Department of Ecology.

WAC 173-27-130 establishes the requirements and procedures for filing decisions on permits with the Department of Ecology. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.200 Requests for review.

WAC 173-27-220 establishes the procedures and time periods for requesting review of decisions that have been issued by either the city or the Department of Ecology on substantial development permits, conditional use permits and variances and other decisions under the Shoreline Management Act and the shoreline master program. (Ord. 2012-10 § 3 (Exh. B) (part), 2012)


16.09.210 Time to commence and complete development.

WAC 173-27-090 establishes time requirements for commencing and completing work authorized by a permit under the Shoreline Management Act and the shoreline master program.

Section 100. General Provisions and Administration


16.20.105 Purpose.

It is the intent of the city of Poulsbo that the beneficial structure, value and functions (RCW 36.70A.172(1) and WAC 365-195-825(2)(b)) of critical areas be preserved, and potential damage or public costs associated with the inappropriate use of such areas be minimized by reasonable regulation of uses within, adjacent to or directly affecting such areas. Further, the purpose of this chapter is to identify and protect critical areas as required by the Growth Management Act of 1990 (Title 36, Laws of 1990, as amended), which are wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, areas subject to frequent flooding, geologically hazardous areas, and critical aquifer recharge areas. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.110 Identification of critical areas.

The critical areas in the city of Poulsbo are hereby further divided into the following types:

A.    Wetland critical areas;

B.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation critical areas;

C.    Geologically hazardous areas;

D.    Critical aquifer recharge areas;

E.    Frequently flooded areas. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.115 Applicability.

A.    The city of Poulsbo shall not grant any permit, license or other development approval to alter the condition of any land, water or vegetation, or to construct or alter any structure or improvement, nor shall any person alter the condition of any land, water or vegetation, or construct or alter any structure or improvement, for any development proposal regulated by this chapter, except in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be considered a violation and subject to enforcement procedures as provided for in this chapter.

B.    This title applies to all uses and activities within areas or adjacent to areas designated as regulated critical areas and/or their buffers unless identified as exempt in Section 16.20.120. Such activities include, but are not limited to:

1.    Removing, excavating, disturbing, or dredging soil, sand, gravel, minerals, organic matter, or materials of any kind;

2.    Dumping, discharging, or filling with any material;

3.    Draining, flooding, or disturbing the water level or water table;

4.    Driving pilings or placing obstructions;

5.    Constructing, demolishing, or altering the size of any structure or infrastructure that results in disturbance of a critical area or the addition of any impervious surface coverage to a site that results in disturbance of a critical area;

6.    Destroying or altering vegetation through clearing, grading, harvesting, shading, or planting vegetation that would alter the character of a critical area;

7.    Activities that result in significant changes in water temperature and physical or chemical characteristics of water sources, including quantity and pollutants; and

8.    Any other activity that has a potential to significantly adversely impact or alter a critical area or established buffer not otherwise exempt from the provisions of this chapter.

C.    Requirements for critical areas are in addition to, or to be combined with, requirements of other development regulations, including, but not limited to, the Poulsbo zoning ordinance, clearing and grading ordinance, subdivision ordinance and the shoreline master program. In case of conflict with other development regulations or other critical area requirements, the more restrictive provision or combinations of provisions shall apply. Further, any parts of wetland or nonwetland fish and wildlife critical areas also included in the one-hundred-year floodplain by Chapter 15.24, Floodplain Management, shall also be subject to the provisions of that chapter.

D.    Uses and activities in critical areas or their buffers and building setbacks from the critical area buffer, for which no other land use or development permit or approval is required by other city ordinance, remain subject to the development standards and other requirements of this section, and a critical area permit shall be required unless specifically identified as exempt.

E.    Any development proposal that includes a critical area or its buffer, or is within three hundred feet of a critical area, is subject to review under the provisions of this chapter.

F.    The location and extent of all mapped critical areas shown on the city of Poulsbo critical area maps1 are approximate and shall be used as a general guide only for the assistance of property owners and city administrators. The type, extent and boundaries shall be determined in the field by a qualified specialist or specialists according to the requirements of this chapter. The critical area maps1 are adopted as part of this chapter and are incorporated herein by this reference.

3.    In the event of a conflict between the mapped areas and the criteria or standards of this chapter, this chapter shall apply. In the event that a boundary determination made by a qualified specialist finds that a critical area is not present on the property, the critical area designation shall be considered for removal from the map. In the event that a critical area which meets the criteria or standards for a critical area is found on a property not mapped as a critical area, the property shall be deemed to contain a critical area and shall be treated as if it had been included on the appropriate critical area map.

4.    The planning director shall have the authority to issue revised critical area maps when new or revised information becomes available regarding the presence or absence of critical areas within the city or urban growth boundary. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2012-10 § 5 (Exh. D) (part), 2012; Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.120 General exemptions.

The following activities are exempt from the requirements of this chapter. All exempted activities shall use reasonable methods to avoid potential impacts to critical areas. To be exempt from this chapter does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity may be considered a violation of this chapter and subject to enforcement and restoration under Section 16.20.150.

The following developments, activities, and associated uses shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter; provided, that they are otherwise consistent with the provisions of other local, state, and federal laws and requirements:

A.    Emergency activities necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or that pose an immediate risk of damage to private property and that require remedial or preventative action in a time frame too short to allow for compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

Emergency actions that create an impact to a critical area or its buffer shall use reasonable methods to address the emergency; in addition, they must have the least possible impact to the critical area or its buffer. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the city of Poulsbo within one working day following commencement of the emergency activity. Within thirty days, the director shall determine if the action taken was within the scope of the emergency actions allowed in this subsection. If the director determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then the enforcement provisions of Section 16.20.150 shall apply. Upon cessation of the emergency, restoration of the critical areas and buffers impacted by the emergency action shall be required in a timely manner. Upon abatement of the emergency situation, any permit that would have been required to be obtained under the Poulsbo Municipal Code shall be required.

B.    Existing and ongoing agricultural activities on lands containing critical areas. For the purpose of this chapter, “existing and ongoing” means that the activity has been conducted within the past five years. Any expansion of agricultural activities shall conform to the provisions of this chapter.

C.    Normal and routine maintenance and operation of existing retention/detention facilities, biofilters and other stormwater management facilities, irrigation and drainage ditches, farm ponds, manure lagoons and livestock water ponds; provided, that such activities shall not involve expansions or alterations that would increase the impact on or expand such uses further into critical areas not currently being used for such activity.

D.    Structural alterations to buildings, permitted under the underlying zoning district, that do not alter the structural footprint or introduce new adverse impacts to a critical area.

E.    Normal and routine maintenance or repair of existing utility structures within a right-of-way or existing utility corridor or easements, including cutting, removal and/or mowing of vegetation above the ground that utilizes best management practices and does not expand the use or activity further into the critical area.

F.    Installation, construction, replacement, operation or alteration in improved public road right-of-way of all electric facilities, lines, equipment or appurtenances; this does not include substations, water and sewer lines, all natural gas, cable communications and telephone facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment or appurtenances.

G.    Forest practices conducted pursuant to Chapter 76.09 RCW, except Class IV (general conversions) and conversion option harvest plans (COHP).

H.    Where a threat to human life or property is demonstrated, the director may allow removal of danger or hazard trees within a critical area or its buffer, subject to the following criteria:

1.    Tree removal is the minimum necessary to balance protection of the critical area and its buffer with the protection of life and property;

2.    The critical area or its buffer shall be replanted as determined by the director. The director shall coordinate review with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife as determined necessary to assure habitat protection. The director may require the applicant to consult with a professional forester or a certified arborist prior to tree removal. Danger tree abatement may be achieved by felling or topping the tree. Habitat needs may require leaving the fallen tree in the riparian corridor or maintaining a high stump.

I.    To qualify for exemption under this section, the construction of pedestrian trails shall be unpaved and established as a nature path when located in the buffer or critical area; should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the critical area or provided at specific points; located only in the outer twenty-five percent of the buffer area as feasible; are not intended for motorized use; and are no wider than five feet, unless additional width is necessary for safety along a precipice, steep hillside, or other hazardous area. All trail construction shall avoid damaging significant trees and other habitat elements to the greatest degree possible, and does not cross or alter any regulated streams or drainages. Trails proposed to be located in a landslide hazard area or its setback shall be constructed in a manner that does not increase the risk of landslide or erosion.

Trails that do not meet the parameters of this exemption may be permitted through the underlying land use permit or critical areas permit, subject to the standards of Section 16.20.235(G) for wetlands, and Section 16.20.320(F) for trails proposed to be located in a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffer.

J.    Normal and routine maintenance of existing structures, landscaping and gardens, provided they comply with all other regulations in this chapter. Expansions, alterations, or repair in excess of fifty percent of the market value of the improvement shall be reviewed under the provisions of Section 16.20.125, Standards for existing development.

K.    Interrupted Wetland and Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Area Buffers.

1.    Where a legally established, preexisting use of the buffer exists (such as a road or structure that extends into the current regulated buffer), those proposed activities that are within the wetland or stream buffer, but are separated from the critical area by an existing permanent substantial improvement, which serves to eliminate or greatly reduce the impact of the proposed activity upon the critical area, are exempt from establishing full width of the buffer; provided, that impacts to the critical area do not increase.

If a development or improvement is proposed that may result in increased impacts to the existing critical area buffer, even if separated by an existing permanent improvement (such as a road or structure), it shall be evaluated and additional buffer may be required along the impact area of the interruption. To determine if additional buffer is required, a functional analysis may be required. In determining whether a functional analysis is necessary, the planning director shall consider the hydrologic and habitat connection potential and the extent and permanence of the interruption.

2.    Where a legally established, preexisting structure or use is located within a regulated buffer area and where the regulated buffer is fully paved and does not conform to the interrupted buffer provision above, the buffer will end at the edge of pavement, adjacent to the critical area.

L.    The following can be removed by hand or hand-held light equipment; provided, that appropriate methods are used to protect native vegetation and water quality:

1.    English ivy may be removed from plants on which it is adhered or rolled up off the ground provided ground disturbance is minimal and does not cause erosion.

2.    Regulated noxious weeds as listed on the Kitsap County noxious weed list that are required to be eradicated (Class A and Class B) as specified by the Kitsap County Noxious Weed Board.

3.    Noxious weeds (Class A and B) removal in a critical area buffer when the total area is one thousand square feet or less and slopes are less than fifteen percent.

4.    Refuse and debris, provided materials are on the soil surface and provided ground and/or vegetation disturbance is minimal and does not cause erosion.

5.    Additional noxious weeds (Class A and B) removal can occur through a critical area permit and buffer enhancement plan.

M.    Watershed restoration projects that conform to the provisions of RCW 89.08.460 shall be reviewed without fee and approved within forty-five days per RCW 89.08.490.

N.    Fish enhancement projects that conform to the provisions of RCW 77.55.181 shall be reviewed without fee and comments provided as specified in RCW 77.55.181.

O.    Site investigative work necessary for land use application submittals such as surveys, soil logs, percolation tests, and other related activities. Critical area impacts shall be minimized and disturbed areas shall be immediately restored. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.125 Standards for existing development.

Existing development containing a critical area which was lawfully constructed, approved or established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which does not conform to present regulations or standards, may continue as follows:

A.    A legally established, existing structure that does not meet the dimensional standards of this chapter may not be enlarged or altered in any manner unless such enlargement or alteration is in conformance with the following provisions. A critical area permit, a Type II review, shall be required for any proposal which includes reconstruction or remodeling in excess of fifty percent of the market value.

B.    Routine maintenance and repair of preexisting legally established structures as authorized in Section 16.20.120(J). Repair in excess of fifty percent of the market value of the structure shall be considered reconstruction. Normal repair and maintenance does not require a critical area permit.

C.    A legally established structure that has been made nonconforming due to the adoption of this code may be remodeled up to fifty percent of the market value so long as all of the following provisions are met:

1.    The remodel shall not introduce any new, or expand existing, impacts to a critical area unless such impacts are fully mitigated as required for reconstruction in subsection (E)(1) of this section; and

2.    All other standards and requirements contained in the Poulsbo Municipal Code are met.

D.    Residential structures, including multifamily, in a residential zoning district, destroyed by a catastrophe or fire, may be reconstructed up to the original size, placement and density. Structural repair must be initiated within two years of the catastrophe and all of the following provisions apply:

1.    The structure does not necessarily need to be rebuilt on the original footprint if it is requested by the property/homeowner and it is determined that an alternative location on the lot will provide greater protection to the critical area; and

2.    Best management practices shall be employed to assure reconstruction does not negatively impact the critical area.

E.    Preexisting legally established structures that have been made nonconforming due to the adoption of this code and that are located outside a flood hazard area and active landslide hazard area may be remodeled beyond fifty percent of the market value or reconstructed; provided, that such reconstruction and/or remodeling does not increase the footprint area nor extend beyond the existing ground coverage toward a critical area and:

1.    The reconstruction shall be appropriately mitigated to ensure the existing value and function of the critical area is not degraded; further, historic impacts of the existing site development shall be mitigated as per subsection F of this section; and

2.    The reconstruction and/or enlargement meets all other standards and requirements contained in the Poulsbo Municipal Code.

F.    Where mitigation is required in subsection (E)(1) of this section, the applicant shall provide mitigation measures to reduce historic impacts on the critical area which may include requirements to enhance vegetative areas adjacent to the critical area and retrofit existing impervious areas for minimum stormwater quality treatment. Where mitigation opportunities on-site are limited or improvements off-site can be shown to better enhance the critical area at a watershed scale, off-site mitigation measures may be required.

G.    Additional provisions affecting expansions of existing development along Poulsbo Creek are located in Section 16.20.315(F). (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.130 Reasonable use exception.

If the application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property, the applicant may apply for a reasonable use exception pursuant to this section.

A.    A request for a critical area reasonable use exception shall be filed with the director and shall be combined with the underlying development permit. The reasonable use exception request shall be considered a Type III application.

B.    The review authority, in granting a reasonable use exception, must determine that all of the following criteria are met:

1.    Application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property;

2.    There is no other reasonable use with less impact on the critical area;

3.    The proposed development does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety or welfare on or off the development proposal site;

4.    Any alterations permitted to these critical areas shall be the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property;

5.    The inability to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter;

6.    Diminished value shall not be considered denial of all reasonable use; and

7.    The proposal will result in no net loss of critical area functions and values consistent with best available science.

C.    Any authorized alteration of a critical area or buffer under this section shall be subject to conditions established by the city and shall require mitigation under an approved special report pursuant to Section 700 of this chapter. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.133 Public agency and utility exception.

A.    A request for a critical area public agency and utility exception may be made if the application of this chapter would prohibit a development proposal by a public agency or public utility. The public agency and utility exception shall be considered a Type III application.

B.    The review authority, in granting a public agency and utility exception, must determine that all of the following criteria are met:

1.    There is no other practical alternative to the proposed development with less impact on the critical areas;

2.    The application of this chapter would unreasonably restrict the ability to provide services to the public;

C.    Any authorized alteration of a critical area under this section may be subject to conditions established by the city and shall require mitigation under an approved special report pursuant to Section 700 of this chapter. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.135 Notice to title.

Project proponent(s) may be required to file a notice to title with the Kitsap County auditor on all development proposals subject to this chapter, and containing any critical area or its buffer. After review of the development proposal, the director will establish critical area development conditions in accordance with this chapter. These standards will be identified on the approved notice to title. The proponent shall submit proof that the required notice has been filed before the director will issue the underlying permit’s notice of decision. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)

Section 200. Wetlands


16.20.200 Applicability.

Wetlands located outside of the city’s shoreline jurisdiction are regulated by the provisions of this chapter. Wetlands located within the city’s shoreline jurisdiction are regulated by the city’s shoreline master program. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2012-10 § 5 (Exh. D) (part), 2012)


16.20.205 Purpose.

This section applies to all regulated uses within, or adjacent to, areas designated as wetlands, as categorized in Section 16.20.215. Under the conditions of this section, the city may deny development purposes that would irreparably impact regulated wetlands. The intent of this section is to:

A.    Achieve no net loss of wetland acreage, functions and values. Mitigation measures, as conditions of permits, must have a reasonable expectation of success;

B.    Plan wetland uses and activities in a manner that allows property holders to benefit from wetland property ownership wherever allowable under the conditions of this section and chapter; and

C.    Preserve natural flood control, stormwater storage and drainage or stream flow patterns. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.210 Wetland categories.

Per RCW 36.70A.030(21), wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adopted for life in saturation soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, estuaries, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Per WAC 173-22-035, for regulatory purposes, wetlands shall be delineated in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements, adopted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The city of Poulsbo uses the Department of Ecology’s Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington, 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029) or as amended hereafter, to categorize wetlands for the purposes of establishing wetland buffer widths, wetland uses and replacement ratios for wetlands. This system consists of four wetland categories generally designated as in Section 16.20.215. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2012-10 § 5 (Exh. D) (part), 2012: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.215 Regulated and nonregulated wetland classification.

A.    Regulated Wetlands.

1.    Category I Wetlands. Category I wetlands are those that: (a) represent a unique or rare wetland type; or (b) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or (c) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (d) provide a high level of function. Category I wetlands include relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre, wetlands with a high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR, bogs, mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre, wetlands in coastal lagoons, interdunal wetlands that score eight or nine habitat points and are larger than one acre, and wetlands that perform many functions very well as demonstrated by a score of twenty-three to twenty-seven total points. 

2.    Category II Wetlands. Category II wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide a moderately high level of functions. Category II wetlands include estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre or disturbed and larger than one acre, interdunal wetlands greater than one acre or are a mosaic of interdunal wetlands that are one acre or larger, and wetlands that perform functions well as demonstrated by a score of twenty to twenty-two.

3.    Category III Wetlands. Category III wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of function as demonstrated by a score of sixteen to nineteen points, and interdunal wetlands between one-tenth and one acre.

4.    Category IV Wetlands. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions as demonstrated by a score of nine to fifteen points and are often heavily disturbed.

5.    Wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate conversion of other wetlands.

B.    Nonregulated Wetlands (RCW 36.70A.030(21)).

1.    Created Wetlands. Wetlands created intentionally from a nonwetland site that were not required to be constructed as mitigation for adverse wetland impacts. These may include, but are not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds as defined in this chapter, and landscape amenities.

2.    Road-Construction-Related Wetlands. Wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that the wetland meets these criteria. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.220 Application requirements.

A.    Application Procedures for New Development. Any new development on a parcel or parcels containing a regulated wetland or its buffer, or within three hundred feet of a wetland or its buffer, shall provide the special reports listed below, as required by the department, prior to any development authorization by the department:

1.    Wetland assessment report (Section 16.20.725), if wetlands or buffers are within three hundred feet but outside of the parcel or parcels and no buffer impacts, reductions, or setback intrusions are proposed;

2.    Wetland delineation report (Section 16.20.730) if wetland or buffers occur within the parcel or parcels;

3.    Wetland mitigation report (Section 16.20.735), if wetland or buffer impacts are anticipated or if the director requires buffer enhancement; and

4.    Erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by Poulsbo Municipal Code construction and development standards contained in Chapter 12.02.

The director may require additional reports or information to further identify potential impacts to any part of the environment. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.225 Determination of wetland boundaries.

A.    Wetland delineation shall be conducted and results reviewed according to the requirements of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. The applicant shall be responsible for hiring a qualified wetlands specialist to determine the wetland boundary through a field survey. This specialist shall stake or flag the wetland boundary. For all new development, and as required by the director, this line shall be surveyed by a professional land surveyor licensed in the state of Washington or recorded using a differential global positioning system. In the event that a global positioning system is used, wetland boundary information, including position accuracies, shall be provided to the city in an electronic data format acceptable to the city. The regulated wetland boundary and regulated buffer shall be identified on all grading, landscaping, site, utility or other development plans submitted in support of the project.

B.    Where the applicant has provided a delineation of a wetland boundary, the director shall require peer-reviewed verification of the wetland boundary by a qualified wetlands specialist at the cost of the applicant, and may require that adjustments to the boundary be made by a wetlands specialist. If a consensus cannot be reached between the applicant and the city of Poulsbo with respect to the location of the wetland boundary, the city may request assistance from the Department of Ecology. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.230 Wetland and buffer development standards.

For the purpose of this chapter, a regulated wetland and its buffer is a critical area.

A.    Buffers. Buffers shall be undisturbed native species vegetation areas appropriate to the ecoregion, for the purpose of protecting the integrity, function, and value of wetland resources. If the existing buffer does not consist of vegetation adequate to provide the necessary protection, then either the buffer area should be planted or the buffer width should be increased. Any buffer enhancement proposed shall be through an approved buffer enhancement plan. No uses or activities shall be allowed within the buffer unless as otherwise allowed or permitted by this section. If the buffer has previously been disturbed, the director may require the disturbed buffer area be revegetated pursuant to an approved buffer enhancement plan (see also Section 16.20.740). No refuse, including but not limited to household trash, yard waste and commercial/industrial refuse, shall be placed in the buffer.

B.    Impact of Land Use. Different land use intensities can result in high, moderate, or low levels of impact to adjacent wetlands and buffers. Types of land uses are categorized into impact levels as shown on the following table:

Table 16.20.230.A—Types of Land Uses 

	Level of Impact from Land Use	Types of Land Uses Based on Common Use Categories

	High	Residential uses (greater than one unit per acre); schools; churches; public facilities, public/private services and government administrative uses (excluding parks, rights-of-way and utilities); lodging uses; personal, professional, product and automotive services; health care services; commercial and sales uses; animal clinics and kennels; marine-related uses; industrial uses; restaurant uses; museum, club and recreation hall uses; high-intensity parks, outdoor and indoor recreation (golf courses, ballfields, tennis clubs, swimming pools, etc.); conversion to high-intensity agriculture (dairies, nurseries, greenhouses, growing and harvesting crops requiring annual tilling and raising and maintaining animals, etc.); hobby farms.

	Moderate	Residential uses (less than one unit per acre); moderate-intensity parks and outdoor recreation (parks with biking, jogging, etc.); conversion to moderate-intensity agriculture (orchards, hay fields, etc.) and paved trails; building of logging roads; utility corridor or right-of-way shared by several utilities and including access/maintenance road.

	Low	Forestry (cutting of trees only); low-intensity parks and open space (hiking, bird-watching, preservation of natural resources, etc.) and unpaved trails; utility corridor without a maintenance road and little or no vegetation management.

C.    Buffer Widths. All regulated wetlands shall be surrounded by a buffer as follows, based upon Appendix 8-C, Section 8C.2.3 of Wetlands in Washington State—Volume 2: Guidance for Protecting and Managing Wetlands (Ecology Publication No. 05-06-008):

D.    Buffer Measurement. All buffers shall be measured on a horizontal plane from the regulated wetland edge as marked in the field by the wetlands specialist.

E.    Buffer Width Averaging. The widths of buffers may be averaged if this will improve the protection of wetland functions, or if it is the only way to allow for reasonable use of a parcel. Averaging may not be used in conjunction with any of the other provisions for reductions of buffers in subsection F of this section.

1.    Averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

a.    The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower-rated area.

b.    The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower-functioning or less sensitive portion.

c.    The total area of buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-quarters of the required width.

2.    Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following are met:

a.    There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging.

b.    The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a report from a qualified wetland professional.

c.    The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-quarters of the required width.

F.    Decreasing Buffer Widths. Per Section 8C.2.4.1 of Appendix 8-C, Wetlands in Washington State—Volume 2, wetland buffer widths required for “high” intensity land uses can be reduced to those required for “moderate” intensity land uses (see Tables 16.20.230.A and 16.20.230.B) under the following conditions:

1.    For wetlands that score moderate or high for habitat (five to nine points for the habitat score), the width of the buffer can be reduced by no more than twenty-five percent if both of the following criteria are met:

a.    A relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least one hundred feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. “Relatively undisturbed” and “vegetated corridor” are defined in the Western Washington Wetland Rating System. Priority habitats within the city may include:

i.    Wetlands;

ii.    Riparian zones;

iii.    Cliffs;

iv.    Estuary/estuary-like;

v.    Marine/estuarine shorelines;

vi.    Biodiversity and corridors. The corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal protection, such as a conservation easement.

b.    Measures to minimize the impacts of different land uses on wetlands, such as the examples in Table 16.20.230.C, are applied.

2.    For wetlands that score less than five points for habitat, the buffer width can be reduced by no more than twenty-five percent applying measures to minimize the impacts of the proposed land uses, such as the examples in Table 16.20.230.C.

Table 16.20.230.C—Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands from Different Types of Activities  

	Examples of Disturbances	Activities and Uses That Cause Disturbances	Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	Parking lots, warehouses, commercial, manufacturing, residential areas	Direct lights away from wetland.

	Noise	Manufacturing, commercial, residential areas	Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland.

	Toxic runoff*	Parking lots, roads, manufacturing, commercial, residential areas, landscaping	Route all new untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered.

	Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 feet of wetland.

	Apply integrated pest management.

	Stormwater runoff	Parking lots, roads, manufacturing, residential areas, commercial, landscaping	Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development.

	Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enter the buffer.

	Change in water regime	Impermeable surfaces, lawns, clearing and grading	Infiltrate or treat, detain and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns.

	Pets and human disturbance	Residential areas	Use privacy fencing; plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion; place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract.

	Dust	Clearing and grading	Use best management practices to control dust.

*    These examples are not necessarily adequate for minimizing toxic runoff if threatened or endangered species are present.

3.    Decision Criteria. Prior to approval, a buffer reduction proposal shall meet all of the decisional criteria listed below.

a.    It will provide an overall improvement in water quality protection for the wetland; and

b.    It will not adversely affect fish or wildlife species and will provide an overall enhancement to fish and wildlife habitat; and

c.    It will provide a net improvement in drainage and/or stormwater detention capabilities; and

d.    All exposed areas are stabilized with native vegetation, as appropriate; and

e.    It will not lead to unstable earth conditions or create an erosion hazard; and

f.    It will not be materially detrimental to any other property or the city as a whole.

G.    Increasing Buffer Widths. The director may increase buffer zone widths for a development project on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values, per Section 8C.2.5 of Appendix 8-C, Wetlands in Washington State, Volume 2. This determination shall be made only when the director demonstrates any one of the following through appropriate documentation:

1.    The wetland site has known locations of endangered or threatened species, the width of the buffer should be increased to provide adequate protection for the species based on the requirements in Section 8C.2.5.3, as revised, of the Wetlands in Washington State, Volume 2;

2.    The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures alone will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; and

3.    The adjacent land on the development proposal site has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than thirty percent.

H.    Building or Impervious Surface Setbacks. A building or impervious surface setback of fifteen feet is required from the edge of any wetland buffer. Minor structural or impervious surface intrusions into the areas of the setback, such as but not limited to fire escapes, open/uncovered porches, landing places, outside walkways, outside stairways, retaining walls, fences and patios, may be permitted if the department determines upon review of an analysis of buffer functions submitted by the applicant, that such intrusions will not adversely impact the wetland. The setback shall be identified on a site plan.

I.    Signs and Fencing of Wetlands. This subsection applies to those wetlands and their buffers that are within three hundred feet of regulated development activities:

1.    Wetland buffers shall be temporarily fenced or otherwise suitably marked, as required by the director, between the area where the construction activity occurs and the buffer. Fences shall be made of a durable protective barrier and shall be highly visible. Silt fences and plastic construction fences may be used to prevent encroachment on wetlands or their buffers by construction. Temporary fencing shall be removed after the site work has been completed and the site is fully stabilized per city approval.

2.    The director may require that permanent signs and/or fencing be placed on the common boundary between a wetland buffer and the adjacent land. Such signs will identify the wetland buffer and may be required to contain other information related to wetland protection. The director may approve an alternative method of wetland and buffer identification if it provides adequate protection to the wetland and buffer.

J.    Buffer Enhancement Plan. When a buffer is proposed to be averaged, reduced or increased, the applicant shall submit a buffer enhancement plan prepared by a qualified wetland specialist, and in conjunction with a mitigation plan, if required. The report shall assess the habitat, water quality, stormwater detention, groundwater recharge, shoreline protection, and erosion protection functions of the buffer; and assess the effects on those functions. The buffer enhancement plan shall also provide the following:

1.    A map detailing the specific area of enhancement that shows the elevation contours of the site;

2.    A planting plan that uses native plant species indigenous to this region including groundcover, shrubs and trees and designed to provide intensive vegetative planting to result in improved habitat and the screening of the wetland from adjacent disturbances;

3.    Provisions for monitoring and maintenance over the monitoring period as required under Section 16.20.740.

4.    The buffer enhancement plan shall document how the buffer will enhance the functions and values of the wetland. The planting plan shall be reviewed by a third-party consultant hired by the city at the applicant’s expense, or by state resource agency staff person with the appropriate expertise. Such a review will include evaluation of the accuracy and scientific validity of the enhancement plan, and provide written comments including recommendations for additional documentation or revisions. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.235 Additional development standards.

In addition to meeting the development standards in Section 16.20.230, the regulated uses identified below shall also comply with the standards of this section and other applicable state, federal and local ordinances.

A.    Docks. Construction of a dock, pier, moorage, float or launch facility may be permitted subject to criteria in the city’s shoreline master program.

B.    Forest Practice, Class IV General, and Conversion Option Harvest Plans (COHPs). All timber harvesting and associated development activity, such as construction of roads, shall comply with the provisions of this chapter, including the maintenance of buffers around regulated wetlands.

C.    Agricultural Restrictions. In all development proposals which would permit introduction or expansion of agricultural uses, damage to regulated wetlands shall be avoided, and will be regulated as a development activity subject to the provisions of this section.

D.    Road/Street Repair and Construction. Public road or street repair, maintenance, expansion or construction may be allowed in wetlands or wetland buffers subject to the following development standards:

1.    No other reasonable or practicable alternative exists and the road or street crossing serves multiple properties wherever possible;

3.    The road or street repair and construction are the minimum necessary to provide safe roads and streets;

4.    Mitigation shall be performed in accordance with this chapter and specific project mitigation plan requirements; and

5.    Before beginning work in-water or within wetlands, it shall be the responsibility of the agency to ensure that all other required state and federal approvals have been obtained.

E.    Surface Water Management Low Impact Development (LID). A wetland or its buffer can be physically or hydrologically altered to meet the requirements of a stormwater management runoff treatment, LID or flow control best management practices (BMP), if the following criteria are met:

1.    The Category III or IV wetland has a habitat score of three to four points; and no other location is feasible; and

2.    There will be “no net loss” of functions and values of the wetland, and the location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland; and

3.    The wetland does not contain a breeding population of any native amphibian species; and

4.    The hydrologic functions of the wetland can be improved as outlined in questions 3, 4, 5 of Chart 4 and questions 2, 3, 4 of Chart 5 in the “Guide for Selecting Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach” (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/0906032.html); or the wetland is part of a priority restoration plan that achieves restoration goals identified in a shoreline master program or other local or regional watershed plan; and

5.    The wetland lies in the natural routing of the runoff, and the discharge follows the natural routing; and

6.    All regulations regarding stormwater and wetland management are followed, including but not limited to local and state wetland and stormwater codes, manuals and permits; and

7.    Modifications that alter the structure of a wetland or its soils will require permits. Existing functions and values that are lost would have to be compensated/replaced.

A site-specific characterization through a wetland report is required to determine if an LID best management practice (BMP) is feasible for a project site and all of the criteria above are met. The special wetland report shall be prepared consistent with Section 16.20.725 and will be verified through peer review.

A wetland hydrology monitoring plan prepared by a qualified wetland specialist shall be required. The plan shall provide an analysis to demonstrate the baseline hydrologic conditions within the wetland, provide monitoring methods, provide a monitoring program to evaluate the hydrologic conditions post construction, and provide a reporting schedule for submitting monitoring reports to the city. The wetland hydrology monitoring plan shall be verified through peer review.

F.    Trails and Trail-Related Facilities. Construction of public trails and trail-related facilities, such as benches and viewing platforms, may be allowed in wetlands or wetland buffers pursuant to the following guidelines:

1.    Trails and related facilities shall, to the extent feasible, be placed on existing road grades, utility corridors, or any other previously disturbed areas outside of the buffer.

2.    Trails and related facilities that are outside of the buffer shall be planned to minimize removal of trees, soil disturbance and existing hydrological characteristics, shrubs, snags and important wildlife habitat.

3.    Viewing platforms and benches, and access to them, shall be designed and located to minimize disturbances of wildlife habitat and/or critical characteristics of the affected wetland.

4.    Trails and related facilities shall generally be located outside required buffers. Where trails are permitted within buffers, they should be located in the outer twenty-five percent of the wetland buffer area as much as feasible, except where wetland crossings or viewing areas have been approved.

5.    Trails shall generally be limited to pedestrian use unless other more intensive uses, such as bike or horse trails, have been specifically allowed and mitigation has been provided. Trail width shall not exceed five feet unless there is a demonstrated need, subject to review and approval by the director. Trails shall be constructed with pervious materials unless otherwise approved by the director and located in the outer twenty-five percent of the wetland buffer area as much as feasible.

G.    Utilities in Wetlands or Wetland Buffers.

1.    The utility development authorized in Section 16.20.120 shall be allowed, subject to best management practices in wetlands and wetland buffers.

2.    Construction of new utilities outside the road right-of-way or existing utility corridors or easements may be permitted in wetlands or wetland buffers, only when no reasonable alternative location is available and the utility corridor or easement meets the requirements for installation, replacement or vegetation and maintenance outlined below, and as required in the filing and approval of applicable permits and special reports (Section 700 of this chapter) required by this chapter.

3.    Sanitary Sewer or On-Site Sewage Utility. Construction of sanitary sewer lines or on-site sewage systems may be permitted in regulated wetland buffers only when: (a) the applicant demonstrates it is necessary to meet state and/or local health code minimum design standards (not requiring a variance for either horizontal setback or vertical separation), and/or (b) there are no other practicable or reasonable alternatives available and construction meets the requirements of this section. Joint use of the sanitary sewer utility easement by other utilities may be allowed.

4.    New utility corridors or easements shall not be allowed when the regulated wetland or buffer has known locations of federal- or state-listed endangered, threatened or sensitive species, heron rookeries or nesting sites of raptors which are listed as state candidate or state monitor, except in those circumstances where an approved habitat management plan indicates that the utility corridor or easement will not significantly impact the wetland or wetland buffer.

5.    New utility corridor or easement construction and maintenance shall protect the regulated wetland and buffer environment by utilizing the following methods:

a.    New utility corridors or easements shall be aligned when possible to avoid cutting trees greater than twelve inches in diameter at breast height (four and one-half feet), measured on the uphill side.

b.    New utility corridors or easements shall be revegetated with appropriate native vegetation at preconstruction densities or greater, immediately upon completion of construction, or as soon thereafter as possible, if due to seasonal growing constraints. The utility shall ensure that such vegetation survives.

c.    Any additional utility corridor or easement access for maintenance shall be provided as much as possible at specific points, rather than by parallel roads. If parallel roads are necessary, they shall be of a minimum width but no greater than fifteen feet; and shall be contiguous to the location of the utility corridor on the side away from the wetland. Mitigation will be required for any additional access through restoration of vegetation in disturbed areas.

d.    The director may require other additional mitigation measures.

6.    Utility corridor maintenance shall include the following measures to protect the regulated wetland and buffer environment:

a.    Where feasible, painting of utility equipment such as power towers shall not be sprayed or sandblasted, nor should lead-based paints be used.

b.    No pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers may be used in wetland areas or their buffers except those approved by the EPA and the Department of Ecology. Where approved, herbicides must be applied by a licensed applicator in accordance with the safe application practices on the label.

7.    Before beginning work in-water or within wetlands, it shall be the responsibility of the utility to ensure that all other required state and federal approvals have been obtained. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2016-20 § 2 (Att. A (part)), 2016; Ord. 2012-10 § 5 (Exh. D) (part), 2012; Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.240 Wetland alterations.

A.    Mitigation Sequencing. All regulated development activities proposed to impact wetlands or buffers shall be mitigated according to this title subject to the following sequential order (WAC 197-11-768). The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the review authority that each step of this sequence has been adequately addressed prior to approving or permitting impacts to wetlands under this chapter.

1.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

2.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

3.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

4.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

5.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments;

6.    Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures; or

7.    Mitigating for individual actions may include a combination of the above measures.

B.    Mitigation for Regulated Activities in Wetland Buffers. A specific mitigation plan is required and the requirements are provided in Section 16.20.725. Appropriate implementation and timing of the mitigation plan shall be included as conditions of approval of the underlying land use permit.

C.    Mitigation for Regulated Activities in Wetlands. Compensatory mitigation shall be required for regulated activities that result in the loss of wetland acreage or in the reduction of wetland functions or habitat values. A specific mitigation plan is required and the requirements are provided in Section 16.20.725.

1.    A compensatory mitigation plan shall be completed. The applicant shall submit a detailed mitigation plan for compensatory mitigation to the department.

2.    The detailed mitigation plan shall be prepared, signed, and dated by the wetlands specialist to indicate that the plan is in accordance with specifications as determined by the wetlands specialist. A signed original mitigation plan shall be submitted to the department.

3.    Approval of the detailed mitigation plan shall be signified through conditions of approval of the underlying land use permit and requiring appropriate implementation and timing of the mitigation plan.

4.    The mitigation project shall be completed according to a schedule agreed upon between the department and the applicant as included in the wetland mitigation plan and conditions of approval.

5.    Wetland mitigation shall occur according to the approved wetland mitigation plan and shall be consistent with provisions of this chapter and title.

6.    A wetlands specialist shall be on site during construction and plant installation phases of all mitigation projects.

7.    On completion of construction for the wetland mitigation project, the wetlands specialist shall submit an as-built report to the department for review and approval.

D.    Wetland Replacement Ratios.

1.    The ratios presented here are based on the type of compensatory mitigation proposed (restoration, creation/establishment, or enhancement). These types of compensatory mitigation, listed in order of preference, are defined as follows:

a.    Restoration. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland. For the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres, restoration is divided into:

i.    Reestablishment. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. Activities could include removing fill material, plugging ditches, or breaking drain tiles. Reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres and functions.

ii.    Rehabilitation. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland. Activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influence to a wetland. Rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres.

b.    Creation/Establishment. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics present to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site, where a wetland did not previously exist. Activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod, create hydric soils, and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species. Establishment results in a gain in wetland acres.

c.    Enhancement. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten, intensify or improve specific function(s) or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present. Enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement, floodwater retention or wildlife habitat. Activities typically consist of planting vegetation, controlling nonnative or noxious weeds (Class A and B), modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods, or some combination of these. Enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions, but does not result in a gain in wetland acres.

d.    Preservation. The removal of a threat to, or preventing the decline of, wetland conditions by an action in or near a wetland. This term includes the purchase of land or easements, repairing water control structures or fences, or structural protection. Preservation does not result in a gain of wetland acres (but may result in a gain in functions over the long term). Replacement ratios for preservation will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being lost or degraded and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

2.    The following ratios appearing below in Table 16.20.240, Wetland Mitigation Replacement Ratios, as found in Wetland Mitigation in Washington State—Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a). These ratios shall be used to determine the appropriate amounts of restored, established, or enhanced wetland that will be required to replace impacted wetlands. The first number specifies the amount of wetland area requiring restoration, establishment, or enhancement and the second number specifies the amount of wetland area altered.

Table 16.20.240—Wetland Mitigation Replacement Ratios  

	Wetland Category	Reestablishment or Creation	Rehabilitation Only	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Rehabilitation (RH)	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	All Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 R/C and 1:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 2:1 E	6:1

	All Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 R/C and 2:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 4:1 E	8:1

	Category II estuarine	Case-by-case	4:1 rehabilitation of an estuarine wetland	Case-by-case	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

	Category II interdunal	2:1 compensation has to be interdunal wetland	4:1 compensation has to be interdunal wetland	1:1 R/C and 2:1 RH compensation has to be interdunal wetland	Not considered an option*	Not considered an option*

	All other Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 R/C and 4:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 8:1 E	12:1

	Category I forested	6:1	12:1	1:1 R/C and 10:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 20:1 E	24:1

	Category I based on score for functions	4:1	8:1	1:1 R/C and 6:1 RH	1:1 R/C and 12:1 E	16:1

	Category I natural heritage site	Not considered possible**	6:1 rehabilitation of a natural heritage site	Not considered possible**	R/C not considered possible**	Case-by-case

	Category I coastal lagoon	Not considered possible**	6:1 rehabilitation of a coastal lagoon	Not considered possible**	Not considered possible**	Case-by-case

	Category I bog	Not considered possible**	6:1 rehabilitation of a bog	Not considered possible**	Not considered possible	Case-by-case

	Category I estuarine	Case-by-case	6:1 rehabilitation of an estuarine wetland	Case-by-case	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

*    Due to the dynamic nature of interdunal systems, enhancement is not considered an ecologically appropriate action.

**    Natural heritage sites, coastal lagoons, and bogs are considered irreplaceable wetlands because they perform some special functions that cannot be replaced through compensatory mitigation. Impacts to such wetland would therefore result in a net loss of some functions no matter what kind of compensation is proposed.

3.    The director may increase or decrease the ratios based on one or more of the following:

a.    Replacement ratios may be increased under the following circumstances:

i.    Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation;

ii.    A significant period of time will elapse between impact and establishment of wetland functions at the mitigation site;

iii.    Proposed compensation will result in a lower category wetland or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted; or

iv.    The impact was an unauthorized impact.

b.    Replacement ratios may be decreased under the following circumstances:

i.    Documentation by a wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed compensation actions have a very high likelihood of success based on prior experience. For example, demonstrated prior success with similar compensation actions as those proposed, and/or extensive hydrologic data to support the proposed water regime;

ii.    Documentation by a qualified wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed compensation actions will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being impacted; or

iii.    The proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and are shown to be successful.

c.    Compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration or enhancement of an atypical wetland. An atypical wetland is defined as a wetland whose design does not match the type of wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the proposed site (i.e., the water source(s) and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting). Any designs that provide exaggerated morphology (such as excavating a permanently inundated pond in a seasonally saturated or inundated wetland) or require a berm or engineered structures to hold back water would be considered atypical.

E.    Compensatory Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level or ecological functioning would result from an alternative approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be in-kind and either on-site, or within the same stream reach, sub-basin, or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted). Compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply:

1.    There are no reasonable on-site or in-sub-drainage-basin opportunities (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or on-site and in-sub-drainage-basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts; and

2.    Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland; and

3.    Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless:

a.    Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city or Kitsap County and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site;

b.    Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the bank’s certification; or

c.    Fees are paid to an approved in-lieu-fee program to compensate for the impacts.

F.    Advance Mitigation. Compensatory mitigation in advance of proposed impacts may be allowed on a case-by-case basis where the applicant demonstrates consistency with approved state and/or federal advance mitigation programs and policies. Approval of an advance mitigation plan is not a guarantee of future project approval or authorization.

G.    Monitoring Requirements. The city of Poulsbo shall require monitoring reports on an annual basis for a minimum of five years and up to ten years, or until the director determines that the mitigation project has met the performance standards specified in the wetland mitigation plan. The wetland mitigation plan shall provide specific performance standards for monitoring the mitigation project. The performance standards shall be project-specific and use best available science to aid the director in evaluating whether or not the project has achieved success. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)

16.20.315 Development standards.

The following development standards shall apply to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas:

A.    Buffers and Setbacks. Buffers and building setbacks shall be maintained along all identified fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, as indicated in this section.

1.    Buffers and building setbacks shall be maintained along all identified fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Distances shall be measured horizontally from the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) or from the top of the bank where the OHWM cannot be identified. Building setbacks shall be measured horizontally from the edge of the buffer.

a.    For streams in ravines with ravine sides ten feet or greater in height, the minimum buffer width shall be the minimum required or a width which extends twenty-five feet beyond the top of the slope, whichever is greater.

2.    Buffers shall be retained in at least the quality of their existing condition. Where impacts or reductions of the standard buffer width are proposed, the director may require the remaining buffer be enhanced to protect the quality and function of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area through a buffer enhancement plan. Refuse, including but not limited to household trash, yard waste, and commercial/industrial refuse, shall not be placed in the buffer.

3.    Stream buffers shall include streamside wetlands and/or functional floodplains which provide overflow storage for stormwaters, provide groundwater recharge or discharge functions, or provide seasonal shelter and food for fish. In braided channels, the OHWM or top of bank shall be defined so as to include the entire stream feature.

4.    Where wetlands and geologically hazardous areas occur on a site that contains a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, refer to Sections 200, Wetlands, and 400, Geologically Hazardous Areas, of this chapter for additional development standards. In cases of differing standards, the more restrictive buffer or setback shall apply.

5.    Building Setbacks. An additional building setback of twenty-five feet is required from the edge of all fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffers.

a.    If applicable, the required building setbacks may meet or contribute to specific yard setback requirements of Title 18.

b.    Minor structural or impervious surface intrusions such as but not limited to fire escapes, open/uncovered porches, landing places, outside walkways, outside stairways, retaining walls fences, and patios may be permitted within the required building setback if the director determines, upon submittal of a habitat management plan, that such intrusions will not adversely impact the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer. The setback shall be identified on the site plan or appropriate drawing.

6.    New Development or Redevelopment. Standard buffers and building setbacks for fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be required as per Table 16.20.315.

(c) Maintain vegetation on hill slopes adjacent to stream.

(d) Retain curb along SR 305 to direct stormwater runoff, and provide stormwater treatment facilities prior to runoff entering creek.

(e) Pruning of riparian vegetation is prohibited. Removal of noxious weeds (Class A and B) and replanting of existing buffer areas with native riparian vegetation may be required at the time of major site plan amendments or redevelopment.

(f) No tree cutting (except for removal of danger trees in accordance with Section 16.20.120(H)) on canyon side slopes and bottoms in Wilderness Park.

(g) No tree cutting (except for removal of danger trees in accordance with Section 16.20.120(H)) or land clearing along both sides of stream between Wilderness Park and SR 305.

(h) Retain forested wetland at downstream side of Lincoln Road.

(i) Require on-site infiltration of stormwater, where soils are appropriate, for new construction; establish downspout disconnection program for existing development.

* Main stem segment also subject to shoreline regulations in Chapter 16.08 as appropriate.

	Other Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas

	Buffer widths and building setbacks for other regulated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas not listed above will be determined on a case-by-case basis through a habitat management plan, which shall be based upon the most recent WDFW Priority Habitat and Species Management Recommendations.

B.    Changes to Standard Buffers.

1.    Provisions for Decreasing the Standard Buffers Recommended through a Habitat Management Plan.

a.    The director may decrease the standard buffer or building setback as recommended by a habitat management plan after consultation with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Suquamish Tribe, and determine that conditions are sufficient to protect the affected habitat. A habitat management plan shall be required. The director may reduce the buffer or building setback width by up to twenty-five percent, but the buffer width shall not be less than fifty feet.

2.    Provisions for Increasing Standard Buffers. The director may increase the buffer width whenever a specific development proposal has known locations of endangered or threatened species for which a habitat management plan indicates a larger buffer is necessary to protect habitat values for such species.

3.    Conditional Alterations. The director may alter the standard buffer, and building setback for water-dependent structures and utilities within a stream or its buffer when no other reasonable or practical alternative exists. Any alteration of a buffer or building setback shall be the least necessary and shall require a habitat management plan which identifies and adequately protects any affected fish and wildlife conservation area.

C.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and required buffers shall be located within specified open space tracts. The specified open space tracts shall be identified on the underlying land use permit drawings and conditions of approval shall include provisions for preservation, maintenance and other requirements deemed necessary by the director and/or review authority.

D.    All development permits on sites with known locations of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, or sites within three hundred feet to known locations of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, shall submit a habitat assessment or management plan as specified in Section 700 of this chapter for approval. In the case of bald eagles, an approved bald eagle management plan by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, meeting the requirements and guidelines of the bald eagle protection rules (WAC 220-610-100), as now or hereafter amended, shall satisfy the requirements for a habitat management plan.

E.    Habitat Assessment Report and Management Plan. For all regulated activity proposed on a site which contains or is within three hundred feet of fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, a habitat assessment shall be prepared by a qualified wildlife biologist. The habitat assessment shall identify the type of stream and its prescribed buffer, an analysis of species or habitats known or suspected, and assessment of project impact or effect on habitat and water quality (see Section 16.20.750). If it is determined that a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer does not occur on or within three hundred feet of the site, or if it is demonstrated that the project will comply with the standard buffer width and building setback requirements, the development may proceed without any additional requirements under this section. If it is determined that a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area does occur on or within three hundred feet of the site, and a modification (i.e., reduction, intrusion or impact) to the standard buffer width and/or building setback is proposed, a habitat management plan shall be prepared. (See Section 16.20.730.)

F.    Signs and Fencing. As a project condition of approval, the director or review authority may require the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area and buffer be permanently fenced, signed or an acceptable alternative, to further protect the conservation area. Timing, location and type of installation shall be identified in the condition of approval. Fencing shall be required when reductions of buffer or intrusions into building setback are approved.

G.    Provisions for Expansions of Existing Development along Poulsbo Creek. Existing development adjacent to Poulsbo Creek which was lawfully constructed, approved or established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which does not conform to present regulations or standards, may be expanded as follows:

1.    A nonconforming single-family residence or mobile home may be enlarged up to fifty percent of its existing size as long as:

a.    The new construction extends away from the critical area and related buffer and building setback, is located over an existing impervious area, or is a second/third-story addition located over the existing structure;

b.    The reconstruction and/or enlargement shall be appropriately mitigated to ensure the existing value and function of the critical area is not degraded;

c.    Mitigation and enhancement is required as per subsection (G)(2) of this section;

d.    The structure(s) are located outside of a flood hazard area and active landslide hazard area; and

e.    The reconstruction and/or enlargement meets all other dimensional standards and requirements contained in the Poulsbo Municipal Code.

2.    Requirements for mitigation and enhancement will be determined based on historic site impacts to the critical area, the scope of proposed alterations and require the preparation of a habitat management plan. Possible mitigation and enhancement may include, but shall not be limited to: prohibiting or limiting pruning of riparian vegetation; invasive plant removal and reestablishment of native trees and shrubs within existing buffer areas; instream habitat improvements such as spawning gravel or large woody debris; requiring minimum stormwater treatment for new construction; and retrofitting existing impervious areas with minimum stormwater treatment where feasible. In certain instances, off-site mitigation and/or enhancement may also be required to benefit the watershed.

3.    Proposals that proposed to utilize these requirements shall require a critical area permit, a Type II review. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2012-10 § 5 (Exh. D) (part), 2012; Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.320 Project-specific development standards.

A.    Stream Crossings. Any private or public road expansion or construction which is allowed and must cross streams classified within this chapter shall comply with the following minimum development standards:

1.    Bridges or bottomless culverts shall be required for all streams which support fish life, unless a habitat management plan is submitted which demonstrates that other alternatives would not result in significant impacts to the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area and as determined appropriate through the Hydraulic Project Approval process administered by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

2.    Crossings shall not occur in salmonid spawning areas unless no other feasible crossing site exists. For new development proposals, if existing crossings are determined to adversely impact salmon spawning or passage areas, new or upgraded crossings shall be located as determined necessary through coordination with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife;

3.    Bridge piers or abutments shall not be placed in either the floodway or between the ordinary high water marks unless no other feasible alternative placement exists;

4.    Crossings shall not diminish flood-carrying capacity;

5.    Crossings shall serve multiple properties whenever possible;

6.    Publicly owned or maintained road or street crossing shall provide for other purposes, such as utility crossing, pedestrian or bicycle easements, viewing points, whenever possible;

7.    Where there is no reasonable alternative to providing a conventional culvert, the culvert shall be the minimum length necessary to accommodate the permitted activity. If located on a stream containing fish and wildlife habitat per WAC 222-16-030, the culvert shall be designed in accordance with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s 2013 Water Crossing Guidelines (or as amended).

B.    Stream Relocations. Stream relocations for the purpose of flood protection and/or fisheries restoration shall only be permitted when adhering to the following minimum performance standards and when consistent with Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Hydraulic Project Approval, and any other local, state or federal permits:

1.    The channel, bank and buffer should be replanted with native vegetation that replicates a natural, undisturbed riparian condition;

2.    For those shorelands and waters prone to flooding, a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington shall provide information demonstrating that the equivalent base flood storage volume and function will be maintained;

3.    Relocated stream channels shall be designed to meet or exceed the functions and values of the stream to be relocated; and

4.    Relocation proposal shall include an evaluation report addressing potential downstream impacts to public and private properties, critical areas and listed species; changes to hydroperiod, water quality, flooding frequency or severity; and any necessary downstream stormwater facility improvements associated with the relocation.

C.    Pesticides, Fertilizers and Herbicides. No pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers may be used in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or their buffers, except those approved by the EPA and approved under a DOE water quality modification permit for use in the specific fish and wildlife habitat conservation area environments. Where approved, herbicides must be applied by a licensed applicator in accordance with the safe application practices on the label.

D.    Agricultural Restrictions. In all development proposals or activities which would permit introduction of agriculture to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, damage to the area shall be avoided by installation of fencing located not closer than the outer buffer edge.

E.    Poulsbo Shoreline Master Program. All development along the saltwater shoreline defined as shorelines of the state shall be consistent with the city of Poulsbo shoreline master program, as now or hereafter amended.

F.    Trails and Trail-Related Facilities. Construction of public and private trails and trail-related facilities, such as benches, interpretative centers, and viewing platforms, may be allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or buffers pursuant to the following standards:

1.    Trails and related facilities shall, to the extent feasible, be placed on existing road grades, utility corridors, or other such previously disturbed areas outside of required buffers;

2.    Trails and related facilities shall be planned to be located generally outside of required buffers, and minimize removal of trees, shrubs, snags and important wildlife habitat;

3.    Viewing platforms, interpretive centers, benches and access to them shall be designed and located to minimize disturbance of wildlife habitat and/or critical characteristics of the affected conservation area;

4.    Trails and related facilities shall generally be located outside required buffers. Where trails are permitted within buffers, after exhausting items of subsections (F)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, shall be located in the outer twenty-five percent of the buffer as feasible, except where stream crossings or viewing areas have been approved;

5.    Trails shall generally be limited to pedestrian use unless other more intensive uses, such as bike or horse trails, have been specifically allowed and mitigation has been provided. Trail width shall not exceed five feet unless there is a demonstrated need, subject to review and approval by review authority. Trails shall be constructed with pervious materials unless otherwise approved by the review authority and located in the outer twenty-five percent of the buffer area as much as feasible.

6.    Mitigation may be required to replace native vegetation removed for trail construction or enhance remaining areas of degraded buffer.

7.    Stormwater controls may be required for larger, paved trails.

8.    Trails shall be located only with property owner agreement. If proposed as a public trail, access shall be executed by appropriate easements, dedication, acquisition or other acceptable legal mechanisms.

G.    Utilities. Placement of utilities within designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and buffers may be allowed pursuant to the following standards:

1.    The utility development authorized in Section 16.20.120 shall be allowed, subject to best management practices in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and buffers.

2.    Construction of new utilities outside the road right-of-way or existing utility corridors or easements may be permitted in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or their buffers, only when no reasonable alternative location is available and the utility corridor or easement meets the requirements for installation, replacement of vegetation and maintenance outlined below, and as required in the filing and approval of applicable permits and special reports (Section 700 of this chapter) required by this chapter.

3.    Sewer or On-Site Sewage Utility. Construction of sewer lines or on-site sewage systems may be permitted in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or their buffers when the applicant demonstrates it is necessary to meet state and/or local health code requirements, there are no other practicable alternatives available, and the construction meets the requirements of this section. Joint use of the sewer utility corridor by other utilities may be allowed.

4.    New utility corridors or easements shall not be allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas with known locations of federal- or state-listed endangered, threatened or sensitive species, heron rookeries or nesting sites of raptors which are listed as state candidate or state monitor, except in those circumstances where an approved habitat management plan indicates that the utility corridor or easement will not significantly impact the fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or buffers.

5.    New utility corridor or easement construction and maintenance shall protect the environment of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and their buffers.

a.    New utility corridors or easements shall be aligned when possible to avoid cutting trees greater than twelve inches in diameter at breast height (four and one-half feet), measured on the uphill side.

b.    New utility corridors or easements shall be revegetated with appropriate native vegetation at preconstruction densities or greater, immediately upon completion of construction, or as soon thereafter as possible, if due to seasonal growing constraints. The utility shall ensure that such vegetation survives.

c.    Any additional utility corridor or easement access for maintenance shall be provided as much as possible at specific points, rather than by parallel roads. If parallel roads are necessary, they shall be of a minimum width but no greater than fifteen feet; and shall be contiguous to the location of the utility corridor on the side away from the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area. Mitigation will be required for any additional access through restoration of vegetation in disturbed areas.

d.    The director may require other additional mitigation measures.

6.    Utility corridor maintenance shall include the following measures to protect the regulated fish and wildlife habitat conservation area and buffer environment:

a.    Where feasible, painting of utility equipment such as power towers shall not be sprayed or sandblasted, nor should lead-based paints be used.

b.    No pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers may be used in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or their buffers except those approved by the EPA and the Department of Ecology. Where approved, herbicides must be applied by a licensed applicator in accordance with the safe application practices on the label.

c.    Refueling or maintenance of utility equipment shall not be conducted within a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer.

H.    Bank Stabilization. A stream channel and bank may be stabilized when naturally occurring earth movement threatens existing structures (defined as requiring a building permit pursuant to the International Building Code), public improvements, unique natural resources, public health, safety or welfare, or is the only feasible access to property; and when such stabilization results in maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat, flood control and improvement of water quality. Shoreline stabilization is regulated by the city’s shoreline master program.

When bank stabilization is determined to be necessary, bioengineering or other nonstructural methods should be the first option for protection. The director may require that bank stabilization be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington with demonstrated expertise in hydraulic actions. Bank stabilization projects may also require a Hydraulic Project Approval from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and may be required to meet the design guidelines in WDFW’s 2002 Integrated Streambank Protection Guidelines.

Seismic areas may include former wetlands which have been covered with fill; or

f.    Areas mapped as “severe” in all development limitations based on mapped soil units of the USDA Soil Conservation Service. These designations are listed in Table 10 of Soil Survey of Kitsap County Area, Washington.

B.    Site-Specific Determination—Geological and Geotechnical Report Provisions. Depending upon the site and proposed project, a geotechnical or geological report shall be required from the applicant to confirm or modify existing information about a specific site and for development proposals located within geologically hazardous areas and areas of geologic concern. The requirements for special reports are contained in Section 700 of this chapter. Project proponents are responsible for determining whether a geologically hazardous area exists and is regulated pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.415 Allowable uses.

A.    The director may limit the types, locations and intensity of proposed land uses and development if such limits are recommended by a geotechnical report prepared according to the requirements in Section 700 of this chapter.

B.    Critical facilities as defined below are restricted in geologically hazardous areas as defined in Section 16.20.410(A)(1). Critical facilities as defined below may be restricted from locating in areas of geologic concern as defined in Section 16.20.410(A)(2) unless no other location is feasible and if a geotechnical report prepared according to the requirements in Section 700 of this chapter is submitted.

1.    Critical facilities are those facilities that meet one or more of the following criteria:

a.    Facilities that are essential to the health and welfare of the population, including services that protect life and property. Such facilities include, but are not limited to, hospitals, emergency clinics, police and fire stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers, aviation control centers, and utility facilities such as sewage treatment plants and electric transmission substations.

b.    Facilities that are intended or likely to serve as public emergency shelter locations.

16.20.420 Development standards.

A.    Approval. The director will review all submittals for clearing, grading and building on property containing geologically hazardous areas or areas of geologic concern. The director will consider any proposed mitigation measures included in a geotechnical report, if submitted. In cases where a special report indicates a significant risk to public health, safety or welfare, the city shall deny or require revision of the application.

B.    City Engineer Requirements. The city engineer, in conjunction with a clearing, grading or building permit application in geologically hazardous areas or areas of geologic concern, may require, but not be limited to, construction plans, details and specifications for clearing, grading, erosion and sedimentation control and stormwater drainage, and detailed hydrological, geotechnical, soils and drainage reports and analyses that address the potential concerns and mitigations for development in geologically hazardous area or area of geologic concern.

C.    Required Buffer. A standard buffer of twenty-five feet shall be established from the top, toe, and all edges of geologically hazardous areas and areas of geologic concern, unless otherwise specified through a geological report or site-specific determination. Existing vegetation shall be retained, or the buffer shall be replanted with appropriate native vegetation.

D.    Buffer and Building Setback Modifications. The minimum native vegetative buffer and/or building setback requirement may be decreased if a geotechnical report demonstrates that a lesser distance, and the design and engineering, will adequately protect the proposed development and stabilize the potential hazard.

Should the report indicate a greater buffer and/or building setback than required by this section, the greater buffer and/or building setback shall be required.

E.    Time Limitations. For new or redevelopment, clearing and grading may be limited by the city engineer to the period between May 1st and October 1st, unless the applicant provides an erosion and sedimentation control plan prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington that specifically identifies methods of erosion control for wet weather conditions.

F.    Field Marking Requirements. For new or redevelopment, the proposed clearing for the project and all critical area buffers shall be required to be marked in the field for inspection and approval by the city prior to beginning work. Field marking shall remain in place until construction is completed and final approval is granted by the city. The requirement for field marking will be identified as a condition of approval for the underlying development permit.

G.    Trees and Vegetation. The following requirements apply in geologically hazardous areas and areas of geologic concern:

1.    As a development permit condition, the director may require enhancement of native buffer vegetation and trees to increase protection of the hazard area by stabilizing slopes and preventing soil erosion. A management plan shall be prepared for such enhancement, and the installation shall require maintenance bonding for a minimum of five years to ensure that performance standards have been met.

2.    Removal of danger trees is allowed only if such activity is approved by the director, and requires a written determination by a certified arborist in the state of Washington that the trees proposed for elimination represent a legitimate safety hazard. The director may require that stumps and root systems be retained for soil retention and erosion control.

3.    Minor pruning of vegetation may be allowed only if such activity is approved by the director and is conducted according to a plan prepared by a certified arborist in the state of Washington and peer reviewed and approved by the city arborist.

H.    Roads and Utilities.

1.    Only the clearing necessary to install temporary erosion control measures will be allowed prior to clearing for roads and utilities construction;

2.    Clearing for roads and utilities shall be the minimum necessary and shall remain within marked construction limits;

3.    Clearing for overhead power lines shall be the minimum necessary for construction and will provide the required minimum clearances of the serving utility; and

4.    Where existing logging roads occur in geologically hazardous areas or areas of geologic concern, a geological or geotechnical report may be required prior to use as a temporary haul road or permanent access road under a conversion or conversion option harvest plan forest practices application.

I.    Seismic Hazard Areas Standards. Applications for new or redevelopment within seismic hazard areas may be required to provide a geotechnical report, addressing any fill or grading that has occurred on the subject parcel. Any fill placed for such development shall have documented construction monitoring as required by the International Building Code. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007. Formerly 16.20.415)

Section 500. Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas


16.20.505 Purpose.

The intent of this section is to provide water quality protection associated with aquifer recharge areas through the regulation of land use activities that pose a potential contaminant threat or could increase the vulnerability of the aquifer. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.510 Critical aquifer recharge area categories.

A critical aquifer recharge area (CARA) is a geographic area with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water, including areas where an aquifer that is a source of drinking water is vulnerable to contamination that would affect the potability of the water, or is susceptible to reduced recharge (WAC 365-190-030). CARAs are established according to the following categories:

A.    Wellhead Protection Zones.

1.    The area inside the one-year time of travel zone for Group A water system supply wells, calculated in accordance with the Washington State Wellhead Protection Program.

2.    For Group A water system supply wells, five-year time of travel zones in wellhead protection areas are also included as critical aquifer recharge areas when the well draws its water from an aquifer that is at or above sea level and is overlain by permeable soils listed in subsection (B)(1) of this section, without an underlying protective impermeable layer.

B.    Aquifer Recharge Areas of Concern. Aquifer recharge areas of concern (ARAC) are those areas which provide recharge to current or potential potable water supplies and are vulnerable to contamination, and meet any one of the following criteria:

1.    Highly Permeable Soils. Soils that have relatively high permeability and high infiltration potential may provide for groundwater recharge, but also may enhance transfer of contaminants from the surface to groundwater.

The general location and characteristics of soils are identified in the Soil Survey of Kitsap County. The following soil types are considered to have relatively high permeability and are aquifer recharge areas of concern:

 

Table 16.20.510.A—Soil Types 

	Soil Type	Soil Map Units

	Grove	11, 12, 13

	Indianola	18, 19, 20, 21

	Neilton	34, 35, 36

	Norma	37, 38

	Poulsbo/Ragner	41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47

2.    Areas above Shallow Principal Aquifers. Surface areas above shallow principal aquifers which are not separated from the underlying aquifers by an impermeable layer that provides adequate protections to preclude the proposed land use from contaminating the shallow aquifer(s) below.

3.    Areas with High Concentration of Group B Water System Wells and Private Domestic Wells. Locations with well concentrations of thirty-six map units or more within a one-mile radius of the proposed land use. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 2007-24 § 2 (part), 2007)


16.20.515 Development standards.

A.    Wellhead Protection Zones. Land uses identified in Table 16.20.515 shall require a hydrogeological report (see Section 700 of this chapter, Special Reports). The hydrogeological report shall include a detailed risk-benefit analysis that considers credible, worst-case scenarios, and shall evaluate potential impacts of a proposed land use or activity on both groundwater and surface water quality. Uses listed in Table 16.20.515 may only be permitted where the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed activity will not cause contaminants to enter the aquifer and that the proposed activity will not adversely affect the recharging of groundwater.

1.    Land uses or activities for new development that pose a significant hazard to the city’s groundwater resources are prohibited and include (but are not limited to): landfills, wood treatment facilities, chrome platers, tank farms, facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste, and chemical facilities that transfer or use large amounts of chemicals.

B.    Aquifer Recharge Areas of Concern.

1.    Applicants proposing operations that pose a potential threat to groundwater as listed in Table 16.20.515 in aquifer recharge areas of concern may be required to submit a hydrogeological report (see Section 700 of this chapter, Special Reports). The scope of the report shall be based on site-specific conditions.

2.    The need for additional information will be determined by the department, the health district and the affected water purveyor. Based on the results of the report, controls, mitigation, and/or other requirements will be established as a prerequisite for the development proposal being approved.

C.    Notification and Review.

1.    Affected water purveyors, tribes and the Kitsap County health district will be notified and invited to comment during the preliminary phases of the city’s review process on the proposed land use and potential impacts. The purveyor may recommend appropriate mitigation to reduce potential impacts. The department will consider these recommendations to develop appropriate permit conditions.

2.    The department will also notify the health district and affected water purveyors through the environmental review process, when those development activities listed in Table 16.20.515 are proposed outside the areas designated critical aquifer recharge areas.

D.    Stormwater.

1.    Stormwater treatment and infiltration shall be required where soils permit and is determined feasible.

2.    Low impact development best management practices (BMP) are required for smaller developments exempted from requirements to construct stormwater facilities.

E.    Uses Requiring County, State or Federal Approval. Applicants shall provide the department with documentation of compliance with county, state and/or federal regulations associated with uses listed in Table 16.20.515.

16.20.735 Wetland mitigation plan.

Whenever the director has determined that impacts to regulated wetlands or buffers are necessary and unavoidable, or a review of a regulated wetland or its buffer is proposed, or a reasonable use exception is applied, a mitigation plan shall be prepared:

A.    The applicant shall demonstrate that mitigation sequencing was applied to the project, in the following order:

1.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of actions. This may be accomplished by selecting a practicable alternative that does not involve wetlands or buffer impacts. The applicant must describe practicable alternatives to the project that avoid environmental impacts, and provide valid reasoning why those alternatives would not fulfill the purpose and need of the project.

2.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree of magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts. This may be accomplished by selecting a reasonable design alternative that avoids most environmental impacts, and minimizes others to the greatest extent possible.

3.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. This may be accomplished by restoring the environmental functions of an area temporarily affected by a project.

4.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. This may be done through operational constraints and/or modifications which result in the reduction or elimination of impacts over time. This typically is done in conjunction with other mitigating actions.

5.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments. This may be done by intentionally creating wetlands and wetland buffers at another location where none currently exist, improving existing wetlands and wetland buffers at another location, or otherwise providing a substitute wetland resource at another location as compensation for any unavoidable adverse wetland impacts. Compensation shall be accomplished in accordance with a mitigation plan, as prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined below, and as approved by the director.

6.    Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures.

7.    Mitigating for individual actions may include a combination of the above measures.

B.    The overall goal of any mitigation plan shall be no net loss of regulated wetland functions and acreage.

C.    Those persons proposing wetland compensatory projects shall show that the compensation project is associated with an activity or development otherwise permitted and that the restored, created, or enhanced wetland will be as persistent as the wetland it replaces by accomplishing the following:

1.    Demonstrate sufficient scientific expertise, supervisory capability, and financial resources to carry out the project;

2.    Demonstrate the capability for monitoring the site and for making corrections during this period, if the project fails to meet the stated goals and objectives; and

3.    Protect and manage or provide for the protection and management of the compensation area to avoid further development or degradation.

D.    Wetland mitigation plans shall be implemented by the project applicant, and include the following components:

1.    Baseline Information. A written assessment and accompanying maps of the impacted wetland shall be produced by the applicant or applicant’s consultant and shall include, at a minimum: existing wetland acreage; vegetative, faunal and hydrologic characteristics; soil and substrate conditions; and topographic elevations.

2.    If the compensation site is off site from the impacted wetland site, baseline information about it, in addition to the above information about the impacted wetland, shall be provided by the applicant and shall include existing wetland acreage; vegetative, faunal and hydrologic characteristics; soil and substrate conditions; and topographic elevations; the relationship of the compensation site within the watershed and to existing water bodies; detailed description of the site selection process and valid rationale for the selected site; existing and proposed compensation site conditions; buffers; and ownership.

3.    Environmental Goals and Objectives. The report shall identify goals and objectives and include:

a.    The purposes of the compensation measures, including identification of compensation goals, identification of target evaluation species and resource functions, dates for beginning and completion of compensation measures, and a complete description of structure and functional relationships sought in the new wetland. The goals and objectives shall be related to the functions of the original wetland or, if out-of-kind, the type of wetland to be emulated; and

b.    A review of the available literature and/or experience to date in restoring or creating the type of wetland proposed shall be provided. An analysis of the likelihood of success of the compensation project at duplicating the original wetland shall be provided based on the experiences of comparable projects, if any.

C.    A short subdivision may contain any number of tracts (land reserved for special uses, such as surface water retention, utility facilities, access, open space, recreation areas, tree retention areas, critical area and buffers). Tracts are not considered lots or building sites for purposes of development or density, shall be identified as such on the face of the short plat, and held under common ownership by the plat lot owners. When tracts are provided and intended for common ownership (i.e., not dedicated to the city), a statement on the face of the plat and in the plat’s covenants, conditions and restrictions (CCRs) shall be included that states: “Tracts identified are intended for their stated purpose and have no development potential, cannot be sold or further subdivided.”

Corner lots for residential use may require additional width to insure appropriate building setback requirements.

B.    Building Setback Lines. Generally, building setback lines are not required to be shown. Where watercourses, topography, geology and soils, vegetation, utilities, lot configuration or other unique circumstances dictate a different building envelope than that set forth in the setback requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located, the building setback lines may be required to be shown on the land division instrument and observed in the development of the lot.

C.    Future Subdivision of Lots. When the subdivision or short subdivision in residential zoned districts will result in a lot fifteen thousand square feet or larger in size, it may be required that the location of lot lines and other details of layout be such that the future subdivision may readily be made without violating the requirements of this section and without interfering with orderly extension and connection of adjacent streets.

D.    Lots for Building Pads. In commercial, industrial, business park, and multifamily residential development utilizing binding site plan, lots with boundaries coterminous or nearly so with building walls may be created.

Additional right-of-way may be required where future conditions and development impacts warrant, or where topographical requirements necessitate cuts or fills for proper grading of the streets.

C.    Preliminary plats shall provide for at least two different standard routes for ingress and egress.

1.    The requirement for an existing or future street connection(s) in Section 17.80.060 shall contribute to meeting this requirement.

2.    If, based upon existing development pattern, topography, adjacent property owner willingness, or street connectivity to adjacent property will occur in the future, and only one public street provides primary access to the entrance points of a new residential subdivision, the following shall apply:

a.    A secondary emergency access road of a minimum of twenty feet unobstructed width shall be established within an access easement and connect to a different street than the primary access points. The emergency access road shall be constructed as an all-weather surface as approved by the city fire official and city engineer. When street connection to adjacent property or a second public street access is provided, the emergency access road may be abandoned, if approved by the city’s fire official and city engineer.

i.    Sufficient evidence must be provided to the city that an emergency access road could not be acquired due to adjacent property owner willingness, topography, or other technically acceptable reason.

ii.    Additional fire protection and emergency vehicle access measures, such as but not limited to sprinklering, widening the primary access street with turn-outs, building in phases, shall be proposed by the applicant of the preliminary plat and incorporated into the plat design and/or conditions of approval.

c.    The city engineer may determine the secondary emergency access is not required, upon consultation and concurrence by the city fire official, based upon the size of plat, topography, existing land development pattern, access to public streets or other technical reasons that will be entered into as a finding for the preliminary plat. (Ord. 2017-22 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017)


17.80.060 Street connectivity.

The purpose of street connectivity is threefold: (1) to implement the city’s comprehensive plan’s future street plan; (2) to provide redundant and efficient routes and connections within the city; and (3) provide superior emergency vehicle response time by providing multiple access to streets. Street connectivity shall be implemented as follows:

A.    New streets shall be provided and located consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan transportation map series and new roadway segments map:

1.    Where topography, adjacent property owner willingness, natural features or other conditions make achievement of a planned alignment impractical, the street alignment, connection and/or location shall be as approved by the city engineer consistent with the intent of planned alignment.

2.    The required improvement must be related in nature and extent to the impact of the development.

3.    When requiring a new street to be provided consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan new roadway segments map, the city shall provide a finding of fact with the subdivision decision, setting forth that the requirement of the new street is supported under the city’s Growth Management Act responsibility to provide for adequate streets and roads for its allocated population, and, based upon the city’s adopted comprehensive plan, there is a reasonable assurance the new street shall be completed.

B.    New subdivisions shall connect to or provide a future connection to adjacent property.

1.    The application shall contain signatures of the majority of those persons having an ownership interest of lots, parcels, sites, tracts, or divisions in the subject subdivision or portion to be altered.

2.    If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants that were filed at the time of the subdivision, and the application for alteration would result in the violation of a covenant, the application shall contain an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the alteration of the subdivision or portion thereof.

3.    Easements established by a dedication are property rights that cannot be extinguished or altered without the written and filed approval of the easement owner or owners, unless the plat or other document creating the dedicated easement provides for an alternative method or methods to extinguish or alter the easement.

C.    Notice of Application Required. A notice of application shall be provided to all owners within the subdivision and to property owners within three hundred feet from the subdivision, posted on the property in three locations, and published in a paper of general circulation.

D.    Public Hearing Required. The review authority shall conduct a public hearing on the application for a subdivision alteration. A public hearing notice shall be prepared and distributed as set forth in subsection C of this section. The notice of application and public hearing notice may be combined; provided, that it is distributed no less than fourteen days prior to the public hearing.

E.    Decision Criteria. The review authority shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny an alteration. The decision shall be in writing and shall include findings and conclusions based on the record to support the decision.

1.    The proposed alteration complies with this title and other applicable city requirements.

2.    The proposed alteration will serve the public interest or use.

3.    The proposed alteration will not result in the violation of any requirements of the original approval, unless conditions necessitating such requirements have changed since the original plat was recorded.

F.    Assessments. If any land within the alteration is part of an assessment district, any outstanding assessments shall be equitably divided and levied against the remaining lots or parcels or be levied equitably on the lots resulting from the alteration.

G.    Revised Plat Drawing. After approval of the alteration, the applicant shall produce a revised plat drawing titled “Alteration of (insert subdivision/project name)” showing the entire subdivision or portion thereof being altered. The altered plat shall include a note indicating the nature of the alteration. The new drawing shall be submitted to the city for signatures. After recording, the applicant shall submit a copy of the recorded alteration drawing to the city. (Ord. 2017-22 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017)


17.90.030 Vacation of recorded land division.

A.    Plat vacations are required whenever a property owner wishes to vacate, or a portion thereof, a recorded final subdivision, short subdivision or binding site plan. For purposes of this section, “vacation” shall mean rendering the plat, or portion, null and void and no longer platted.

B.    Application Requirements. A completed plat vacation application for vacation of all or any portion of a subdivision shall be submitted. The applicant shall set forth the reasons for vacation, and the application shall contain signatures of all parties having an ownership interest in that portion to be vacated.

1.    If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants which are filed at the time of approval of the subdivision, and the vacation would result in the violation of a covenant, the application shall contain an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the vacation.

C.    When the vacation application is specifically for a city street or right-of-way, the procedures for street vacation in Chapter 35.79 RCW shall be utilized. When the application is for the vacation of the plat together with the streets, the procedure for vacation in this section shall be used, but vacations of streets may not be made that are prohibited under RCW 35.79.030.

D.    Notice of Application Required. A notice of application shall be provided to all owners within the subdivision and to property owners within three hundred feet from the subdivision, posted on the property, and published in a paper of general circulation.

E.    Public Hearing Required. The review authority shall conduct a public hearing on the application for a subdivision vacation. A public hearing notice shall be prepared and distributed as set forth in subsection D of this section. The notice of application and public hearing notice may be combined; provided, that it is distributed no less than fourteen days prior to the public hearing.

F.    Decision Criteria. The review authority shall approve the application for vacation for the subdivision or approve the application with conditions if it determines that the public use and interest will be served by the vacation. The review authority shall deny the application for vacation if it finds that the public use and interest will not be served by the alteration.

G.    If any portion of the land contained in the subdivision was dedicated to the public for public use or benefit, such land, if not deeded to the city, shall be deeded to the city unless the review authority adopts written findings that the public use would not be served in retaining title to those lands.

H.    Title to the vacated property shall vest with the rightful owner as shown in the county records. If the vacated land is land that was dedicated to the public, for public use other than a road or street, and the review authority has found that retaining title to the land is not in the public interest, title thereto shall vest with the person or persons owning the property on each side thereof, as determined by the review authority. When the street that is to be vacated was contained wholly within the subdivision and is part of the boundary of the subdivision, title to the vacated road or street shall vest with the owner or owners of property contained within the vacated subdivision.

18.70.040 Minimum and maximum densities.

A.    To ensure implementation of the city’s adopted comprehensive plan for planned densities in the residential zoning districts, the following shall establish the minimum and maximum density required in each residential zoning district:

	RL:	Minimum 4 du/net acre

	 	Maximum 5 du/gross acre

	RM:	Minimum 6 du/net acre

	 	Maximum 10 du/gross acre

	RH:	Minimum 11 du/net acre

	 	Maximum 14 du/gross acre

B.    Calculation.

1.    The minimum density shall be calculated by multiplying the development’s subject site net acreage by the minimum number of dwelling units required in the applicable zoning district. (Net acreage is the development subject site’s gross acreage minus acreage for public rights-of-way, private road easements, designated critical area and buffer protection, and storm management facilities; but not including parks and public or private recreation facilities dedicated or created as an integral part of the development.)

2.    The maximum density shall be calculated by multiplying the development’s subject site gross acreage by the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in the applicable zoning district.

3.    The units associated with assisted living, congregate care, nursing home, residential care facilities and the like, that rely on shared cooking/dining facilities, will not be counted for purposes of the minimum/maximum density calculation. Independent dwelling units (i.e., containing a bed, bathroom, and a kitchen with a sink, stove, and refrigerator) in such group living residential uses, however, shall be counted as individual dwelling units in the density calculation. The density for non-independent dwelling units shall not be transferred to another portion of the development.

C.    Standards.

1.    All new residential development (subdivisions, PRDs, site plans, condominium) must meet the minimum and maximum density requirements.

2.    Land subdivision in all residential zones must meet the minimum and maximum density requirements; provided, that a subdivision may create one lot in a size large enough to be further subdivided in the future based on the minimum lot size requirements of the applicable residential zone and the subject lot must be developed in such a way so not to prevent future subdivision from occurring that meets all of the city’s lot dimensional requirements.

3.    Nonresidential uses, accessory dwelling units, and on-site residences in conjunction with neighborhood commercial are exempt from minimum/maximum density requirements.

4.    Legal lots of record that do not meet the minimum density requirements may be developed with a single dwelling unit; provided, that if the lot is of a size that can be further subdivided in the future based on the minimum lot size requirements of the applicable residential zone, the dwelling unit must be located so not to prevent future subdivision from occurring that meets all of the city’s lot dimensional requirements.

5.    When the minimum or maximum density results in a fraction of a unit, the density shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. For calculations of X.1 to X.4, the density shall be rounded down; for calculations of X.5 to X.9, the density shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

6.    On parcels proposed for residential development where an existing dwelling exists and is not proposed to be removed or replaced, the existing dwelling will be included in the subject site’s minimum/maximum density calculation and must meet the required minimum/maximum lot size.

7.    For residential development utilizing the provisions of planned residential developments (PRD), see Chapter 18.260 for additional provisions. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)

3.    Larger amenities, such as (but not limited to) community building, tennis courts, and swimming pools, may count as at least two amenities towards a project’s required recreational amenities, or as approved by the review authority.

4.    For attached units, each unit shall have an exclusive accessible outdoor private space of not less than forty-eight square feet in area. The area shall be designed to provide privacy for unit residents and their guests.

5.    The recreational amenities are to be maintained by a homeowners’ association, property management, or other private association approved by the review authority.

D.    Landscaping, Site and Building Design Standards.

1.    Site Landscaping. All developments proposed in the RM/RH zoning districts must provide landscaping as follows:

a.    Minimum Requirement. A minimum of twenty percent of the property area shall be landscaped. Setback, parking lot, street trees and building perimeter landscaping contributes to this requirement.

b.    Critical area buffers may count toward this requirement, but cannot contribute more than forty percent of the twenty percent overall site landscaping requirement.

c.    Retaining land at its natural grade with existing native vegetation is strongly encouraged and may contribute toward the required landscape percentage requirement if the existing vegetation is healthy and likely to survive development. A maintenance assurance device, agreement or bond for two years will be required to ensure the existing vegetation remains healthy and additional vegetation appropriate to the overall site’s landscape plan must be installed if the existing vegetation does not survive.

d.    Tree retention as required in Chapter 18.180 may contribute toward the required landscape percentage requirement.

e.    Low impact development techniques for stormwater management that are not fenced and can be designed to integrate vegetation appropriately into the site’s overall landscape plan may count toward this requirement as approved by the review authority.

f.    Areas designated for special setbacks between buildings and common recreational amenities shall be landscaped, and such landscaped areas may contribute toward the required landscape percentage requirement.

2.    Setback Landscaping.

a.    Setback areas are to be landscaped and covered with live plant materials that will ultimately cover seventy-five percent of the ground area within three years. One tree (deciduous tree of a minimum of two inches caliper or one six-foot evergreen tree) and three shrubs, each of which will attain a height of three and one-half feet within three years, shall be provided for every three hundred square feet of area to be landscaped.

b.    Setback landscaping may include low impact development stormwater management facilities that are not fenced and can be designed to integrate vegetation appropriately into the setback’s landscape area.

c.    When adjacent to the RL zoning district, setback landscaping shall be provided for the full width of the setback, and will include a combination of sight-obscuring fencing, solid screen of evergreen trees and shrubs and berming, as approved by the review authority.

3.    Street Trees. Street trees and related landscaping shall be provided forty feet on center for arterials and thirty feet on center for collectors within a minimum five-foot planting strip. Groundcover of sod or other approved groundcover shall be provided. Species of trees shall be as set forth in the city’s master street tree plan if applicable, or as otherwise approved by the review authority.

4.    Parking Lot Landscaping. Parking lots with more than ten spaces shall be landscaped. A minimum of five percent of the parking lot area (that area inside parking lot perimeter curbing) shall be landscaped; planting area width shall be a minimum of five feet. Providing adequate shading opportunities should be taken into account. Parked vehicles may not overhang if the planting area width is the minimum five feet. Wheel stops are required for all parking spaces abutting landscaped areas. Unfenced low impact development stormwater management facilities may be located in parking lot landscaping when feasible and when designed to be integrated appropriately in the landscaped area, and may count toward the parking lot landscaping requirement.

5.    Building Perimeter Landscaping. For any building wall that exceeds an average of thirty feet in height, a planting bed is required with a hierarchy of plantings for at least sixty percent of the wall length provided:

a.    Columnar trees shall be installed minimum four feet from the building’s foundation within a minimum six-foot-wide planting bed at the structure’s foundation/base; or larger trees may be planted twenty-five feet on center within a fifteen-foot planting bed and minimum ten feet from base.

b.    Shrubs or small trees ranging from one to six feet in height at maturity shall be planted three to six feet on center (depending on size at maturity) within the required planting bed.

c.    Groundcover or other organic material shall be provided to reduce wind and water erosion.

6.    On-Site Pedestrian Circulation. For residential developments in the RM/RH zoning districts, an on-site pedestrian circulation system meeting the following standards shall be provided. The pedestrian circulation system is in addition to recreational amenities identified in subsection C of this section.

a.    Pathways between dwelling units and the street are required. Such pathways shall make a direct connection to the street.

b.    The pedestrian circulation system shall connect entrances on the site. For townhouses or other residential units fronting on the street, the sidewalk may be used to meet this standard. For multiple-building developments, pedestrian connections to other areas of the site, such as parking areas, recreational areas, common open space and other amenities shall be required. Pedestrian pathways may be located within setback landscaping.

c.    Landscaped beds shall be provided along interior site pedestrian pathways and have a combination of overstory and understory vegetation.

d.    Pedestrian pathways should be at least five feet wide. Segments of the circulation system that provide access to no more than six residential units may be three feet wide. Pervious pavement or other permeable surfacing will be allowed on pedestrian connections, as approved by the city engineer.

e.    Pedestrian pathways shall be clearly defined and designed to be separated from driveways and parking areas, through the use of raised curbs, elevation changes, bollards, landscaping, different paving materials, and/or other similar treatments. Striping does not meet this requirement.

8.    Building Design Standards. The purpose of building design standards in the RM and RH zoning districts is to facilitate attractive architectural design and scale by avoiding large blank walls, bright colors and providing roof line treatment.

The following standards apply to multifamily developments, live/work, neighborhood commercial, and nonresidential use building design in the RM and RH zoning districts. The city’s design review process applies to all proposals that require site plan review or a building permit that contains substantial building facade alteration to the exterior of an existing building. See also Chapter 18.120.

a.    Building Facades.

i.    Architectural articulation and interest is required for all building facades visible from public streets, internal access roads, common open space, parking areas and other publicly visible areas. Treatments include but are not limited to insets or offsets, canopies/awnings, colonnades, wing walls, gables, window clusters, trellises, building facade landscaping, material/color/texture variation, multi-planed roof line, planters, and pedestrian amenities, such as benches and tables. Both vertical and horizontal building modulation shall be required.

ii.    Provide visual terminus to tops of buildings. To avoid a truncated appearance, all structures shall have a visual “cap.” Provide picture of and identify. Options include extended eaves; steep pitch, hip, gable or saltbox roof form; false pitch roof with appearance of hip gable or saltbox; or projecting cornice of appropriate scale to the building and part of building’s trim detail.


[IMAGE]


iii.    All structures including residential units must include but are not limited to two of the following: decorative porch with distinct design; decorative treatment of windows and doors, such as molding/framing details, decorative glazing, or door designs; landscaped trellises or other decorative element that incorporates landscaping near building entry or entries; brick or stonework covering more than ten percent of the facade; decorative roof line design, including multiple gables and/or dormers, decorative railings, grill work, or terraced landscape beds integrated along the facade of the building; decorative balcony design; other detailing work that adds visual interest to the building as approved by the review authority.

iv.    Window trim shall be provided for all windows above ground floor and of a width appropriate to scale for the building. The trim shall contrast with the base building color. Other distinctive window treatment may be approved by the review authority.


[IMAGE]


b.    Materials. Siding must include two different types of materials. The following are examples of desired materials: horizontal lap siding (of any lap design) made of wood or cement-like materials, shingles made of cedar or cement-like materials, board and batten (or panels with similarly spaced battens), brick, or stone (real or cultured).

c.    Color.

i.    Main color of exterior walls is limited to subtle earth tone colors. Soft white, sands, grays, muted pastels, and deep, rich earth colors (terra cotta, forest green) are acceptable.

ii.    Trim color may be lighter or darker shades of the main color, soft white, or contrast or complement the main color but shall not be bright or bold.

iii.    Accents may be brighter than main or trim color and shall be limited to fifteen percent of the facade area, excluding glass. Bright, high contrast color banding is limited to maximum four inches width.

d.    Multi-building residential developments shall employ techniques to provide architectural variety. This may include alternating building materials, roof line treatments, building heights, building modulation, entry design, window treatment, color and/or other treatments.


[IMAGE]


e.    If any building wall of a multifamily structure is an average thirty feet or higher in height, the subject building upper wall shall be stepped back no less than eight feet. The stepped back upper story shall be distinguished by a change in elements such as window design, railings, trellises, details, materials and/or color, so that the result is an organized combination of features that face the street. Balconies or other outdoor area shall be incorporated into the stepped back areas. (See Section 18.150.060 for example of stepback.)

i.    Alternatives to this requirement may be approved by the review authority as long as the effect is the upper floor appears to recede from view.

9.    Outdoor Storage and Trash Receptacles. Outdoor dumpster and recycling storage and trash receptacles shall be completely screened with a combination of fencing and landscaping from adjacent properties and public right-of-way.

a.    If recreational vehicle storage is provided, it shall be designated and screened by a six-foot weather-resistant fence.

10.    Lighting. Lighting on site should be integrated into the overall design on the project.

a.    Lighting is required for entryways, parking lots, carports, and along pedestrian pathways.

b.    Lighting fixtures shall complement project design.

c.    Lighting shall be oriented and shielded to avoid direct glare onto adjacent properties, while providing adequate safety for pedestrians. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-56 § 4 (part), 2007; Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(B)(3), (B)(5), VI(B), (G)), 2003. Formerly 18.20.030—18.20.050, 18.60.020, 18.60.070)


18.70.070 Additional standards and provisions for R zoning districts.

A.    Accessory Dwelling Units.

1.    Purpose. An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is an additional, smaller dwelling unit on a lot with, or in, an existing home. These units are intended to facilitate land efficiency, encourage affordable housing options, and provide a range of choices of housing types in the city’s residential districts. The ADU is intended to be subordinate in size, location and function to the primary residential unit. An ADU permit is required for all new accessory dwelling units.

2.    Number. One accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is permitted per parcel and as subordinate to an existing single-family detached dwelling.

3.    Types of ADU.

a.    For a new ADU that is located internal to the primary residence (e.g., basement) and in which no increase in square footage of the residence is proposed, an ADU permit is required and will be processed as a Type I permit pursuant to Title 19. This includes conversion of non-living space (e.g., garage) converted to living area in order to accommodate the ADU; provided, that no increase in total square footage of the residence is proposed.

b.    For a new internal and/or attached ADU in which an increase in square footage of the residence is proposed, an administrative conditional use permit is required.

c.    For a new detached ADU (including detached accessory structure or garage), or conversion of an existing detached structure or detached garage, an administrative conditional use permit is required.

4.    Pre-Existing and Nonpermitted Accessory Dwelling Units. If a portion of a single-family residence meets the definition of an internal or detached ADU and has not received an ADU permit, the ADU may continue; provided, that the following requirements are met:

a.    The property owner shall submit an application for registration purposes (an ADU or administrative conditional use permit will not be required, a fee will not be collected, and compliance with current ADU regulations will not be evaluated).

b.    The city will review and inspect the pre-existing ADU to ensure building and fire code requirements are met; the property owner will be required to bring the unit up to minimum public health and safety standards if found inadequate.

5.    Standards.

a.    The ADU shall be permitted as a second dwelling unit added to, created within, or detached from the primary dwelling.

b.    The owner of the property must occupy either the primary residence or the ADU. Only the property owner, which shall include title holders and contract purchasers, may apply for an accessory dwelling unit permit. ADU applications cannot be submitted for speculative new construction. Owner-initiated home construction (custom or on contract to purchase a new home) may apply for an ADU permit; provided, that as part of the application, the property owner provides an affidavit attesting to his/her/their intent to occupy the residence more than six months out of the year.

c.    “Occupied by an owner” means a property owner, as reflected in title records, makes his or her legal residence at the site, as evidenced by property tax, voter registration, vehicle registration, or similar means, and actually resides at the site more than six months out of any given year, and at no time receives rent for the owner-occupied unit.

d.    The total number of occupants in both the primary residence and the accessory dwelling unit combined may not exceed the maximum number established by the definition of “household.”

e.    The accessory dwelling unit shall contain no more than eight hundred square feet of heated living area; provided, if the accessory unit is completely located on a ground floor or basement, the review authority may allow increased size in order to efficiently use all floor area, so long as all other standards set forth in this section are met.

f.    A detached accessory dwelling unit shall be consistent in design and appearance with the primary structure. Specifically, the roof pitch, siding materials, color and window treatment of the ADU shall be the same as the primary structure. A detached ADU shall be limited to twenty-five feet in height and be separated from the primary residence as required by the city’s adopted building code.

g.    The ADU entrance shall be subordinate to the primary structure’s entrance, and oriented away from the view of the street or designed to appear as a secondary entrance to the primary unit.

h.    The accessory dwelling unit shall meet all zoning development standards, such as setback, lot coverage and height restrictions, when increasing square footage or adding a new detached structure; and accessory dwelling units shall meet all building code standards adopted by the city, including building, electrical, fire, and plumbing code requirements.

i.    There shall be one off-street parking space provided for the ADU, which is in addition to the off-street parking spaces required for the primary residence.

j.    Mobile homes, manufactured homes, or recreational vehicles shall not be considered an accessory dwelling unit.

k.    An ADU may not be used as a short-term rental, and must be rented for a minimum of ninety days or more.

6.    Approval.

a.    Any property owner seeking to establish an accessory dwelling unit shall apply for an accessory dwelling unit permit with the planning department. The ADU application will be processed consistent with the appropriate permit type.

b.    If approved, the city shall file the ADU application form and conditions of approval as a deed restriction with the Kitsap County auditor’s office to indicate the presence of the accessory dwelling unit, the requirement of owner occupancy, and other standards for maintaining the unit as described above. The deed restriction shall run with the land and bind all current and future property owner’s assigns, beneficiaries and heirs; unless the ADU registration is otherwise cancelled.

c.    Cancellation of the accessory unit’s registration may be accomplished by the owner submitting notice to the planning department for recording at the Kitsap County auditor’s office, or may occur as a result of enforcement action. The cancellation notice will confirm that the residence has reverted to use as a single dwelling, and the cooking stove in the ADU has been removed.

d.    The accessory dwelling unit shall continue to be permitted upon transfer of property ownership and subject to the limitations of this chapter, the approved ADU permit and deed restriction, unless the ADU registration is otherwise cancelled.

B.    Affordable Low Income Housing Incentives. A density bonus may be granted as an incentive to encourage developers to build affordable low income ownership and rental housing. For every affordable unit that a developer agrees to build, the developer may build additional units greater than would be allowed otherwise.

1.    Density Bonus. Any development that includes at least ten percent of the pre-density-bonus units within the development as affordable for low income households, a density bonus for the development may be granted.

a.    A density bonus of twenty percent unit increase over the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in the underlying zoning district will be granted when ten percent of the pre-density-bonus units are designated as affordable housing.

b.    A density bonus of twenty-five percent unit increase over the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in the underlying zoning district will be granted when fifteen percent of the pre-density-bonus units are designated as affordable housing.

c.    The maximum density bonus is a twenty-five percent increase.

2.    Eligibility.

a.    The density bonus shall apply only to housing developments consisting of five or more dwelling units. The density bonus shall be used to include low income housing units as a part of a larger development, as a means of avoiding concentrating such housing in any given area of the city. The affordable units shall be of a similar size and scale as the rest of the development’s units.

b.    Prior to issuance of a building permit for any dwelling unit in a development for which density bonus units have been awarded, the developer shall enter into an affordable housing development agreement with the city to guarantee for twenty years their continued use and availability to low income households. The terms and conditions of the agreement shall run with the land, be noticed to title, shall be binding upon the successor in interest of the developer, and shall be recorded in the office of the Kitsap County recorder. The agreement shall include the following provisions:

i.    If appropriate, the deeds to the designated units shall state that the developer or his/her successor in interest shall not sell, rent, lease, sublet, assign, or otherwise transfer any interests for same without the written approval of the city confirming the continued use of the designated units for low income households.

ii.    The city shall have the authority to enter into other agreements with the developer or purchasers of the dwelling units as may be necessary to assure that the required dwelling units are continuously occupied by eligible households.

C.    Bed and Breakfasts. Bed and breakfasts provide transient lodging to overnight guests for compensation and usually provide a morning meal as part of the room rate structure.

1.    No more than ten rented rooms shall be provided for a bed and breakfast establishment in the R zones.

2.    Bed and breakfast establishments must meet the Washington State Department of Health bed and breakfast licensing requirements.

3.    Bed and breakfast establishments are subject to the provisions of conditional use permits, Chapter 18.230.

D.    Child Care.

1.    Family Day Care Home. A family day care home shall be permitted in all zoning districts of the city wherein residential structures are permitted, subject to the following conditions:

a.    Must meet Washington State child day care licensing requirements and provide day care for twelve or fewer children.

b.    Comply with all building, fire safety, health code and city business licensing requirements.

e.    A neighborhood meeting shall be held. Procedures for the neighborhood meeting are identified in Title 19.

3.    Infill Residential Design Standards. Property that is eligible for infill residential development and is proposed to be located within an established neighborhood shall adhere to design requirements. While variation in architectural design is desired, the purpose of these requirements is to ensure compatibility of new infill development with the character of the existing neighborhood.

a.    New infill residences shall meet the following design criteria, as defined by the predominant character of the existing block face.

i.    Block Face Definition. The block face shall consist of all residential properties along both sides of the public or private right-of-way or easement on which the infill development fronts. The block face shall be measured from intersection to intersection, to the road end, or two hundred feet in either direction from the building site, whichever is nearest.

Examples of how to measure the block face:

1.    Measured from intersection to intersection—Block face is both sides of the street from intersection to intersection:

2.    Measured to the road end—Block face is both sides of the street from road entry to road end:


[IMAGE]


3.    Measured two hundred feet in either direction from infill site: Block face is both sides of the street two hundred feet in each direction from infill site:


[IMAGE]


ii.    “Predominant” shall mean the most frequently occurring residential design characteristic along both sides of the road frontage along the block face.

b.    Building Orientation. New infill residences’ building orientation within an established neighborhood shall match the predominant orientation of other buildings along the block face.

c.    Front Yard Setback. The front yard setback of an infill residence within an established neighborhood shall be the average of the existing residences along the block face.

d.    Height.

i.    If the infill residences proposed within an established neighborhood are to be taller by five to nine feet in height than the average height of the existing residences on the block face, the infill residences shall step back the upper floor(s) a minimum of five feet as a way to maintain compatible scale.

ii.    When the proposed infill residence’s height is ten feet or higher than the average height of the existing residences on the block face, the upper floor shall step back a minimum of eight feet.

iii.    Stepbacks required above shall be made on the building face in the following circumstances:

a.    Street face; and

b.    Side building face when adjacent to existing residences. New proposed infill residences adjacent to another new infill residence are not required to provide side stepback(s).

iv.    The review authority may determine that the above required stepback does not provide sufficient compatibility of bulk and scale to the existing residences on the block face. Upon providing such a finding, and when the proposed infill residences are ten feet or higher than the average height of the existing residences on the block face, the review authority may decrease the height of the infill residences. The modified building height may not be reduced to less than twenty-five feet.

e.    Architectural Variety. Proposed infill residences within an established neighborhood shall incorporate architectural variety to its front facade, ensuring housing style diversity. Duplicative front facade elevations adjacent to each other are prohibited; simple reverse configurations of the same facade elevation on adjacent lots are not sufficient to meet this requirement. In order to ensure architectural variety, three or more design elements per infill residence shall be utilized:

i.    Different window opening locations and designs;

ii.    Differing roof line configurations;

iii.    Different entry/porch designs;

iv.    Different exterior finish materials and finishes;

v.    Different garage location, configuration and design.

f.    Narrative and Building Design. The applicant shall provide a written narrative describing the predominant character of the existing residences’ block face; detailing how the proposed infill residences’ size, height, placement and design meet the above design standards; and describing how compatibility along the predominant block face has been met. In addition, conceptual architectural building design shall be submitted with the short subdivision and conditional use application.

4.    At the time of building permit application submittal, the planning director will review submitted building permits for compliance with this section, approved conceptual building drawings, and any applicable conditions of approval.

Formerly 18.24.030, 18.24.040, 18.44.040)


18.80.050 Site and building design standards in C-1 downtown/Front Street commercial zoning district.

The C-1 zoning district serves as the center of commercial and social activity within the city of Poulsbo and provides an anchor for the community. Development in downtown Poulsbo shall continue to reinforce and enhance the existing Scandinavian heritage and small-town “waterfront fishing village” character through site planning, architectural features and elements, streetscape features, landscaping, artwork, lighting, and signage.

Overall design standards for C-1 zoning district are:

•    Maintenance and enhancement of street-level street-facing store fronts with individual identity;

•    Remain authentic to downtown Poulsbo’s Scandinavian heritage and character as a waterfront fishing village;

•    Reinforce the “Little Norway” moniker through design details, artwork, community-oriented spaces, and accessories (such as flags, scallops, and lighting);

•    Contemporary modern building forms, including rooflines, are to be avoided;

•    Architectural features and use of color that create visual interest;

•    Height and bulk of buildings are proportional and appropriate to C-1 zoning district and the site;

•    Roof forms include focal points and variation in detail, including pitch, terraced and cornice roof forms;

•    Rooftop equipment is creatively concealed; and

•    Landscaping, hardscapes and urban design elements that unify the site design, the site within the zoning district, and contribute to the character of downtown Poulsbo.

The following site and building design standards for the C-1 commercial zoning district are intended to provide site and architectural design consistent with the existing scale and design of downtown Poulsbo. The city’s design review process applies to all proposals that require site plan review or a building permit that contains substantial building facade alteration. See Chapter 18.120.

A.    Site Design. Sites shall be designed to be consistent with the existing development pattern with an emphasis on the relationships between buildings, streets and public spaces.

1.    Building Location. Buildings shall be located adjacent to the front property line or sidewalk, or if set back the area between the building and sidewalk shall be usable pedestrian-oriented space, such as outside dining, courtyard or forecourt, public square or plaza, or landscaped open space. These pedestrian areas shall be designed consistent with subsection C of this section.


[IMAGE]


Example of forecourt, which is an open area in front of a building’s entrance.

2.    Parking. All parking shall be located to the rear or side of the building(s), undergrade, or underbuilding.

3.    Vehicular Access. Vehicular access shall be from secondary streets and at the ends of buildings whenever feasible. The width of curb cuts shall be the minimum necessary to allow for two-way access. Curb cuts shall be located away from intersections and designed to minimize pedestrian and vehicle conflicts.

4.    Pedestrian Access. The primary pedestrian access to sites and buildings shall be from a public street sidewalk. Pedestrian gathering places should be integrated with pedestrian entrances, crossings, and pathways. Primary building entries shall be clearly identifiable and visible from the street.

5.    Connections. Sites shall be designed to allow pedestrian and vehicular connections to adjacent lots where feasible.

6.    Elements, such as building design features, landscaping features, art, street and pedestrian lighting, public seating areas, shall be incorporated that connect and unify, without becoming homogeneous, the character and sense of place of the C-1 district and/or downtown Poulsbo.

7.    Hardscape shall be incorporated in the form of benches/sitting areas, steps, boulders, plazas, curbing and short walls, terracing, art features, pedestrian lighting, and other elements.


[IMAGE]


Example of hardscape elements, with landscaping and steps leading up to a pedestrian plaza.

B.    Building Design. The intent of the building design standards is to maintain and reinforce appropriately scaled design that is compatible with the existing development pattern and community character of the C-1 zoning district, including active public spaces, friendly storefronts, varying rooflines, peak dormers, and visual access to the shoreline.

1.    New or redeveloped buildings shall be placed adjacent to the front property line or sidewalk, unless a pedestrian courtyard, forecourt, or square is provided. Entrances to retail spaces shall be directly from the sidewalk.

a.    Whenever possible, existing buildings not adjacent to the sidewalk should create pedestrian courtyard, forecourt, squares, seating areas or other pedestrian amenities with the space between the sidewalk and building wall consistent with subsection C of this section.

2.    Prominent Corners. Pedestrian activities are concentrated at corners, where people wait to cross and are most likely to converse with others. New development on corner lots shall take advantage of this condition, adding visual interest to the street while providing clear space for movement.

a.    Buildings on corner lots shall have a strong building form and prominent design elements that are oriented toward the primary intersection. Entry is not required at the corner, but strongly encouraged.

b.    Buildings shall be set back ten feet from the corner to provide for additional streetscape and pedestrian elements. A variety of landscaping, hardscape, low walls, curbing, seating areas, potted plants, artwork, pedestrian and street lighting shall be incorporated into the building setback area.

c.    Auto access for off-street parking shall be located as close as practical to the property line most distant from the intersection.

3.    Building Articulation. Any new building facades publicly visible from a street or parking area shall include articulation features that create a pattern of smaller storefronts to reduce the scale of the building, and/or add visual interest. Multiple articulation methods shall be used, including window patterns, weather protection features, offsets, recesses, staggered walls, stepped walls, pitched or stepped rooflines, overhangs and other elements of the building’s mass. Simply changing materials or color is not sufficient to accomplish this.

Example of how facade articulation provides interest on a rectangular building. This design includes enhanced building edges, varied window design, awning over the sidewalk, recessed doorways, raised panels below windows, and crown molding at roofline.

4.    Architectural Features. Building facades shall incorporate a variety of architectural features to provide visual interest complementary to the existing Scandinavian, small-town “waterfront fishing village,” and/or eclectic downtown Poulsbo character. All new or redeveloped buildings shall be enhanced with appropriate details and employ at least one detail element from each of the three categories below for each facade facing a public right-of-way or parking area.

a.    Window and/or Entry Treatment.

i.    Display windows divided into a grid of multiple panes;

ii.    Transom windows;

iii.    Roll-up windows/doors;

iv.    Recessed entry;

v.    Decorative door;

vi.    Prominent, projecting sills on storefront display windows; and/or

vii.    Other details that meet the intent of the standards as determined by the review authority.

b.    Building Elements and Facade Details.

i.    Decorative, custom hanging sign(s);

ii.    Decorative building-mounted light fixtures;

iii.    Bay windows, trellises, towers, and similar elements;

iv.    Raised panels below storefront windows;

v.    Pilasters with banding, belt courses, insets, reveals or other details;

vi.    Ornamental tile or metal work; and/or

vii.    Other details that meet the intent of the standards as determined by the review authority.

c.    Building Materials and Other Facade Elements.

i.    Masonry soldier course;

ii.    Decorative medallions;

iii.    Artwork on walls, columns, pilasters or other surfaces;

iv.    Decorative kick-plate, pier, belt course, or another similar feature;

v.    Hand-crafted material, such as special wrought iron or carved wood;

vi.    Hanging baskets supported by ornamental brackets; and/or

vii.    Other details that meet the intent of the standards as determined by the review authority.

5.    Street-facing, ground floor facades of commercial and mixed-use buildings shall incorporate generous amounts of glass in the storefront. Storefront construction shall be a minimum of forty percent transparent glass with a maximum of eighty percent transparency on ground floor/street-facing facades and as allowed by the IBC.

A transparent storefront welcomes customers inside with products and services on display and enhances the curb appeal. Storefront construction shall be a minimum of forty percent transparent glass with a maximum of eighty percent transparency.

6.    Blank Walls. Walls publicly visible from a public right-of-way or parking area shall have windows, reveals, or architectural details as described in subsection (B)(4) of this section and consistent with the building code. However, if an uninterrupted expanse of blank wall (longer than fifteen feet) is unavoidable, methods shall be used to soften the impact of the wall, such as landscaping, artwork (mosaic, mural, sculpture), unique building detail at the pedestrian scale, or high-quality building materials.


[IMAGE]

7.    Roof Expression. To avoid a truncated appearance, all structures shall have a visual “cap.” Options include extended eaves; steep pitch hip, gable or saltbox roof form; false pitch roof with appearance of hip gable or saltbox which creates the appearance of a true gable form; or projecting cornice of appropriate scale to the building and part of building’s trim detail. Buildings with flat roofs shall have portions with pitched roofs, extended parapets or projecting cornices to create a prominent edge when viewed from public rights-of-way or parking areas.

	Examples of a defined visual top or cap to a building’s roof line.

8.    Canopies or awnings shall be required on street-facing facades along public streets, providing protection from weather, for at least fifty percent of the building’s length, may overhang right-of-way, and do not need to be continuous.

a.    The design of the canopies/awnings shall be an integral component of the building facade design.

b.    The canopies/awnings shall be at least eight feet above the sidewalk, but no more than twelve feet. The minimum depth projecting from the wall shall be four feet.

c.    Canopies/awnings must be designed so that water running off the canopy/awning does not occur in the clear walkway area.

d.    Canopies/awnings shall be constructed of permanent, durable materials (but not synthetic fabrics) and shall not be internally illuminated.

e.    If used, hanging signs may be hung under the canopy/awning and shall have a clearance of eight feet above the sidewalk.

f.    The requirement for canopies or awnings may be exempted when in conflict with International Building Code requirements or with structural constraints.


[IMAGE]


Canopies in the C-1 zoning district shall provide protection from the weather and be an integral component of the building facade design.

9.    Mechanical and Trash/Recycling Screening. See Section 18.80.080(H).

10.    Lighting. See Section 18.80.080(N).

11.    Building materials and color in the C-1 zoning district shall be as set forth in Sections 18.80.060(A)(8) and (9). See subsections (D)(9) and (10) of this section for shopfront overlay building materials and building colors.

12.    Community View. Consideration of the view of the First Lutheran Church shall be evaluated. Sloping roofs, stepbacks, framing and other architectural design techniques shall be incorporated into the building design when appropriate to mitigate the impact of the view specifically between Moe Street NE and NE Hostmark Street from the west side of Poulsbo.

a.    The planning director may elect to require a visual impact survey if significant impacts to the view of the First Lutheran Church from the west side of Poulsbo are anticipated.

i.    If required, the visual impact survey shall include graphic representation of the proposed building or addition to an existing building at the average permitted height. Photos, photo simulation and other graphics shall be used.

ii.    The city may require the erection of a balloon, crane or similar device to simulate the proposed dimensions and height of a structure if the visual impact survey graphics are not sufficient to determine the visual impact on the viewscape.

C.    Streetscape.

1.    Courtyard/Square. Courtyards, small squares and forecourts are encouraged to afford additional pedestrian activities during the day, evening and all seasons.

a.    Increased building setbacks are allowed at the ground level if the area is designed as a pedestrian courtyard, square, or forecourt.

b.    Increased building setbacks at ground level shall be paved in a decorative brick or textured concrete. If the setback area is not used for retail or restaurant purposes, it shall be maintained as public plaza, with benches, waste receptacles, potted plantings, and similar features.

c.    An optional low wall, landscaping and hardscape elements may be utilized to create an enclosure for sitting areas, active retailing or other entertainment uses. The enclosure shall not encroach on the minimum width of the public sidewalk.

	Pedestrian pathways into buildings may be obtained via passageways. The color, banners and artistic detailing create a vibrant addition to the building and streetscape.	This courtyard in the C-1 zoning district provides an example of an outdoor room created by walls and landscaping.

2.    Awnings, trellises, building canopies, and other architectural structures that do not restrict pedestrian movement may project over the sidewalk right-of-way.

3.    New projects or rehabilitation projects with a value of more than fifty percent of the current assessed value of the property shall provide streetscape improvements. Such improvements shall include paving treatments on sidewalks, parking pockets, landscaping including potted planters, hardscape elements, pedestrian and street lighting as approved by the review authority.

a.    The Master Public Tree Plan (2002) shall be consulted in the selection of street trees. The plan is available upon request.

4.    Pedestrian pathways that connect to other sites and/or buildings shall be provided whenever possible.

5.    When new public sidewalks are constructed, bulb-outs from the sidewalk shall be provided when sufficient right-of-way exists, in order to accommodate street furniture, lighting, landscaping and/or bicycle parking.

D.    Shopfront Overlay. Front Street, and buildings within the shopfront overlay, embody Poulsbo’s Scandinavian heritage and small-town “waterfront fishing village” character. It is important to consider the impact new or refurbished shopfronts will have upon the wider streetscape and overall character of downtown.

Shopfronts are like small buildings with their own design base, “roofline” and pattern of window and door openings. The downtown Poulsbo development pattern and individual small shopfront character shall be maintained. New, refurbished or redeveloped shopfronts shall reinforce the existing character of the shopfront overlay, by providing street-facing building facades that provide unique elements and avoid homogeneous or repetitive design elements. In addition to the standards found in subsections A through C of this section, the following shall apply:

1.    The street level ground floor of shopfronts shall be between eleven feet and sixteen feet tall, as measured from the adjacent walk, and a minimum of ten feet wide.

2.    Shopfront assemblies (display windows, bulkheads and associate framing) shall not be set back into the facade more than three feet maximum, so that passing pedestrians have a clear view of the shop interior.

3.    Primary entry for commercial uses shall be provided through a street-facing facade.

4.    Recessed entries shall be provided and shall incorporate special paving/tiling materials for the entryway, ornamental or treated overhangs when possible, and decorative light fixtures.

5.    Shopfront facades shall feature a base, body and top organization. A typical design will have the bulkhead or stall riser as the base, the merchandise or storefront window as the body, and a transom, awning, facia or cornice as the top of the storefront.

6.    The area below display windows—known as bulkhead or stall riser—shall be balanced and should have different materials than walls. There will be seldom a situation where a stall riser is not required to complete the design of a shopfront facade.

7.    The alignment, proportion and rhythm of shopfront elements—windows, doors, bulkhead, awnings and signage—should be compatible and harmonious within the shopfront overlay.

8.    Doors shall be substantial and well detailed. They should match the materials, design and character of the window framing.


[IMAGE]


New, refurbished or redeveloped shopfronts shall reinforce the existing character of the shopfront overlay, by providing street-facing building facades that provide unique elements and avoid homogeneous or repetitive design elements.

9.    Color is an important element in the individual identity and eclecticism of downtown Poulsbo. In general, colors shall be muted, earthtone, or pastel. In some cases, brighter color may be found to be compatible with existing buildings and colors in the shopfront overlay area. Bright or bold colors are appropriate for architectural details, trim enhancement, doors, or signs.

10.    Materials shall be those commonly found within the shopfront overlay, such as brick and wood. Use of concrete block and metal as primary facade materials is prohibited.

11.    Signage shall be placed in traditional locations, either as hanging, wall-mounted on the first floor or integrated into the awning. Sign clutter shall be avoided.

12.    Businesses in downtown Poulsbo provide diverse shopping experiences, products or eating/drinking opportunities consumers generally do not find online or at typical retail settings. As a pedestrian-friendly downtown, continuation of uses that offer unique experiences is important. Primary uses along the shopfront street frontage (Front Street) will typically be retail, services, food and drinking establishments, or artisan-type or handcrafted products. Other uses are also appropriate in shopfront overlay but shall be located behind or above the primary shopfront uses. These uses are identified in Table 18.80.030, Commercial Zoning Districts Use Table.

13.    To maintain the pedestrian-oriented scale of the shopfront overlay and to provide relief from building mass, for any street-facing building facade that is proposed over an average of thirty feet in height, the upper floor shall be stepped back at the twenty-five-foot height mark, no less than ten feet. The stepped back upper floor shall be distinguished by a change in elements such as window design, railings, trellises, details, materials and/or color, so that the result is an organized combination of features that face the street. Balconies or other outdoor areas with open or transparent railings may extend into the required stepback area. An alternative to this requirement may be approved by the review authority as long as the effect is the upper floor appears to recede from view.

14.    Rear facades visible from 3rd Avenue should complement the dominant materials and design on primary street-facing facades of the buildings, though the design may be simpler. Signage and awnings are encouraged to identify rear public entrance. Trash collection, utility boxes and similar elements are required to be screened and/or maintained in a clear, orderly condition. (Ord. 2018-20 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 8 (Exh. A (10-7) (part)), 2011; Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(C)(7)), 2003. Formerly 18.24.070)


18.80.060 Building design, landscaping and site standards in C-2 Viking Avenue, C-3 SR 305 and C-4 College MarketPlace commercial zoning districts.

The C-2, C-3, and C-4 zoning districts serve as both local and regional commercial centers and the building design and landscaping shall utilize techniques which reduce the scale of large buildings and are responsive to existing site conditions. Building design shall reflect a Northwest Lodge and/or Craftsman style through architectural elements, streetscape features, landscaping, artwork, lighting, and signage.

A.    Building Design Standards. The purpose of building design standards in the C zoning districts is to facilitate attractive architectural design and scale by avoiding large blank walls, bright colors and providing roof line treatment. The city’s design review process applies to all proposals that require site plan review or a building permit that contains substantial building facade alteration to the exterior of an existing building. See also Chapter 18.120.

1.    Architectural Details. Architectural interest is required for all building facades visible from public streets, other publicly visible areas, such as parking areas, and residentially zoned properties. All new or redeveloped buildings shall be enhanced with appropriate details and shall incorporate insets or offsets, canopies, colonnades, wing walls, trellises, building facade landscaping, material variation, multiplaned roof line, stepped back upper floors, or other features which diminish large blank walls.

2.    Articulation. Any building facades visible from public streets and other publicly visible areas that exceed forty feet in width shall include articulation features to reduce the perceived scale of the building and add visual interest. Multiple articulation methods shall be used, including window patterns, offsets, recesses, staggered walls, stepped walls, pitched or stepped rooflines, overhangs and other elements of the building’s mass. Simply changing materials or color is not sufficient to accomplish this.


[IMAGE]


3.    Horizontal Definition. All buildings shall include design techniques which clearly define the building’s top, middle, and bottom. The following techniques are suggested methods of achieving vertical articulation:

a.    Top: sloped roofs, strong eave lines, cornice treatments, horizontal trellises, or sunshades, etc.

b.    Middle: windows, balconies, material changes, railings, and similar treatments that unify the building design.

c.    Bottom: pedestrian-oriented storefronts, pedestrian-scale building details, awnings, arcades, “earth” materials such as concrete, stone, stucco, etc.

Where appropriate, horizontal elements shall be coordinated (i.e., cornices, window lines, arcades, etc.) in a pattern and height to reflect similar elements on neighboring buildings.
[IMAGE]


Buildings should convey a distinct base, middle, and top.

4.    Roof Expression. To avoid a truncated appearance, all structures shall have a visual “cap.” Options include extended eaves; steep pitch hip, gable or saltbox roof form; false pitch roof with appearance of hip gable or saltbox; or projecting cornice of appropriate scale to the building and part of building’s trim detail. Buildings with flat roofs shall have portions with pitched roofs, extended parapets or projecting cornices to create a prominent edge when viewed against the sky, especially to highlight major entrances.

a.    When designing rooftops visible from hillsides, special attention shall be given to prevention of hazardous reflective glare and placement/design of mechanical equipment. Green roofs or “living roofs” are encouraged.

5.    Primary Entrance. The primary entrances to structures, including all entrances to individual tenant spaces, shall be clearly identifiable through architectural design. Specific treatments include, but are not limited to, wall modulation, gables, window clusters, landscape treatment, material/color/texture change, awnings, moldings, planters, and pedestrian amenities, such as benches and tables.

	This commercial building design example features pitched roof, gable, dormer, windows, and overhanging eaves, as well as a variety of materials, such as timbers and stone.	This modern small office building design has a well-articulated form and facade, with a wing wall extending the wall plane to further define the building entrance, as well as providing a garden enclosure.

6.    Weather Protection. Overhangs, marquees, and awnings or similar forms of protection for pedestrians and bicycle racks from adverse weather conditions shall be incorporated at entrances, along pedestrian pathways, and at transportation waiting areas, and shall be at least five feet wide.

7.    Upper Level Setback. For building walls proposed over an average of thirty feet in height, the building facade for that upper floor wall shall be stepped back at least eight feet. The stepped back upper floor shall be distinguished by a change in elements such as window design, railings, trellises, details, materials and/or color, so that the result is an organized combination of features that face the street.

8.    Exterior Materials. Varied and high-quality facade materials shall be integrated with building modulation and articulation elements to unify commercial development and maintain harmony. Materials shall support a Northwest Lodge and/or Craftsman architectural style, generally supporting a bi- or tripartite composition of natural materials. Material changes should be used to distinguish upper, middle and lower floors of the building. Generally, heavier masonry materials should be used at the base of the building and lighter wood materials above, with contrasting trim used to accent floors, doors, window openings and material changes.

a.    Facades visible from public streets or other publicly visible areas shall provide visual interest by providing a variety of building materials, windows, artwork, or other techniques. Desired materials include brick, stone, wood, horizontal lap siding made of wood or cement-like materials, split-faced block or ground-faced block.

b.    For structures including mixed-use with residential units, siding materials must include but are not limited to two of the following: horizontal lap siding (of any lap design) made of wood or cement-like materials, shingles made of cedar or cement-like materials, board and batten (or panels with similarly spaced battens), brick, or stone (real or cultured). Typically, the residential component will be differentiated from the nonresidential uses by scale and amount of detailing.

c.    Metal Siding Standards. Metal siding shall have visible corner moldings and trim and shall not extend lower than two feet above grade. Masonry, concrete, or other durable material shall be incorporated between the siding and the ground plane. Metal siding may be used only in conjunction with other approved materials and may comprise no more than twenty-five percent of facades facing public rights-of-way, parking areas, or landscaping. Glazing, awnings, doors, and other features may count as portions of the facade. Preformed panels are not considered as metal siding. Metal siding shall be factory finished, with a matte, nonreflective surface.

d.    Concrete Block Standards. Concrete block may comprise no more than fifty-five percent of a facade facing a public right-of-way, parking areas, or landscaping. Concrete block shall include changes in textures and shapes, colors, and/or other masonry materials to add visual interest.

Bright, high contrast color that is not a variation of the base or trim colors is limited to maximum two inches in width.

d.    Roof. Use any of the following colors for roofs visible from the ground level of public or adjacent properties: earth tones (brown, beige, tan, red-brown, or ochre); grey or slate; dark, natural colors of materials such as brick, stone, or stained or sealed wood; or black or charcoal; or as recommended by the IBC and IECC.

B.    Site Landscaping.

1.    Required Landscaping. A minimum of twenty percent of the property area shall be landscaped. Setback, parking lot, street trees and building perimeter landscaping contributes to this requirement.

a.    Critical area buffers may count toward this requirement, but cannot contribute more than forty percent of the twenty percent overall site landscaping requirement.

b.    Retaining land at its natural grade with existing native vegetation is strongly encouraged and may contribute toward the required landscape percentage requirement if the existing vegetation is healthy and likely to survive development. A maintenance assurance device, agreement or bond for two years will be required to ensure the existing vegetation remains healthy and additional vegetation appropriate to the overall site’s landscape plan must be installed if the existing vegetation does not survive.

c.    Low impact development techniques for stormwater management that are not fenced and can be designed to integrate vegetation appropriately into the site’s overall landscape plan may count toward this requirement at the determination and approval of the review authority.

5.    Parking Lot Landscaping. Landscape areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the large expanses of pavement, divide and define driveways, parking stalls and corridors, limit cross-taxiing, and delineate and separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Planting areas and landscaping shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking lot with the interior dimensions of such areas being sufficient to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to ensure proper growth. The primary landscaping materials used shall consist of canopy-type deciduous trees or spreading evergreen trees planted in wells or strips with a mixture of deciduous and evergreen shrubs and/or ground cover. Shrubbery, hedges, and other planting materials shall be used to complement the tree landscaping, but shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping. Existing vegetation, architectural barriers or berms may be incorporated into the landscape design; provided, they contribute to achieving the intent of this subsection.

a.    Parking lots with more than ten spaces shall be landscaped. A minimum of five percent of the parking lot area (that area inside parking lot perimeter curbing) shall be landscaped. Setback and building perimeter landscaping shall not count towards the parking lot landscaping requirement.

18.90.010 Zoning districts.

The city’s comprehensive plan establishes three land use designations that support the business and employment goals and policies of the city of Poulsbo. The three land use designations will also serve as titles of zoning districts on the city’s zoning map, and are identified as:

A.    Office commercial industrial (OCI).

B.    Business park (BP).

C.    Light industrial (LI).

The three business and employment districts are intended to enhance Poulsbo’s economic base by providing suitable areas to support the employment needs of the community. The business and employment districts provide for the location of manufacturing, product processing, research and development facilities, assembly, warehousing, distribution, professional services, corporate headquarters, medical facilities and complementary educational and recreational uses among others. Limited retail, business and support services that generally serve the needs of the districts’ tenants and patrons are allowed. The business and employment districts are intended to have limited nuisance factors and hazards. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 9 (Exh. A (10-8) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.28.010)


18.90.020 Purposes.

A.    The office commercial industrial (OCI) district provides for business and professional offices, corporate headquarters, research and development facilities, light industry and complementary educational, and recreational uses. The district is not intended to support the general commercial needs of the community; however, limited retail sales, convenience and personal services, and residential, as subordinate uses, are allowed. The OCI district is intended to be compatible and transitional with adjoining uses, have smaller sized and scaled buildings with a more diverse mix of uses than the business park district, and have fewer nuisance factors and hazards than the light industrial district.

B.    The business park (BP) district, located in the College MarketPlace master planned development, is intended to enhance the city’s economic base by providing for an integrated grouping of businesses and buildings of a larger size and scale than the OCI or LI districts may support. The BP district supports a variety of uses, such as light manufacturing, professional office buildings, and warehousing and distribution.

C.    The light industrial (LI) district provides appropriate locations for combining light, clean industries, including industrial service, manufacturing, fabrication, assembly and production; business and technology research and development; and warehousing, distribution and storage activities. Professional offices and sale of goods are subordinate to permitted activities. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 9 (Exh. A (10-8) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.28.020)


18.90.030 Uses.

A.    Types of uses. For the purposes of this chapter, there are four kinds of use:

1.    A permitted (P) use is one that is permitted outright, subject to all the applicable provisions of this title.

2.    A conditional use (C) is discretionary use reviewed through the process set forth in Chapter 18.230 governing conditional uses.

3.    An administrative conditional use (AC) is a discretionary use reviewed through the process set forth in Chapter 18.230 governing administrative conditional uses.

4.    A prohibited use (X) is one that is not permitted in the zoning district under any circumstances.

B.    Recognizing that there may be certain uses not mentioned specifically in Table 18.90.030 because of changing business, technology advances, or other reasons, the planning director is authorized to make similar use determinations, as set forth in Section 18.50.030.

The following Table 18.90.030 is a list of uses for the three zoning districts:

(Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 9 (Exh. A (10-8) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.28.040)


18.90.050 Site planning and design.

A.    Landscaping.

1.    A minimum of twenty percent of the property area shall be landscaped. Setback, parking lot, street trees and building perimeter landscaping contribute to this requirement.

a.    Critical area buffers may count toward this requirement, but cannot contribute more than forty percent of the twenty percent overall site landscaping requirement.

b.    Retaining land at its natural grade with existing native vegetation is strongly encouraged and may contribute toward the required landscape percentage requirement if the existing vegetation is healthy and likely to survive development. A maintenance assurance device, agreement or bond for two years will be required to ensure the existing vegetation remains healthy and additional vegetation appropriate to the overall site’s landscape plan must be installed if the existing vegetation does not survive.

c.    Low impact development techniques for stormwater management that are not fenced and can be designed to integrate vegetation appropriately into the site’s overall landscape plan, may count toward this requirement at the determination and approval of the review authority.

2.    Setback Landscaping.

a.    Setback areas are to be landscaped and covered with live plant materials that will ultimately cover seventy-five percent of the ground area within three years. One tree (deciduous tree of a minimum of two inches caliper or one six-foot-high evergreen tree) and three shrubs, each of which will attain a height of three and one-half feet within three years, shall be provided for every three hundred square feet of area to be landscaped.

b.    Setback landscaping may include low impact development stormwater management facilities that are not fenced and can be designed to integrate vegetation appropriately into the setback’s landscape area.

c.    When adjacent to any R zoning district, setback landscaping shall be provided for the full width of the setback, and will include a combination of sight-obscuring fencing, solid screen of evergreen trees and shrubs and berming, as approved by the review authority.

3.    Street Trees. Street trees and related landscaping shall be provided forty feet on center for arterials and thirty feet on center for collectors within a minimum five-foot planting strip. Groundcover of sod or other approved groundcover shall be provided. Species of trees shall be as set forth in the city’s master street tree plan, if applicable, or as otherwise approved by the review authority.

4.    Parking Lot Landscaping. Parking lots with more than ten spaces shall be landscaped. A minimum of five percent of the parking lot area (that area inside parking lot perimeter curbing) shall be landscaped; planting areas shall be a minimum of five feet width. Providing adequate shading opportunities should be taken into account. Parked vehicles may not overhang if the planting area is the minimum width of five feet. Wheel stops will be required when any parking space abuts landscaping. Unfenced low impact development stormwater management facilities may be located in parking lot landscaping when feasible and when designed to be integrated appropriately in the landscaped area.

5.    Building Perimeter Landscaping. For any building wall that exceeds an average of thirty feet in height and combined with an unmodulated wall exceeding one hundred feet in length (not including loading areas), a planting bed is required, with a hierarchy of plantings for at least sixty percent of the wall’s length provided:

a.    Columnar trees and large shrubs shall be installed a minimum of four feet from the building’s foundation within a minimum six-foot-wide planting bed at the structure’s foundation/base; or larger trees may be planted twenty-five feet on center within a fifteen-foot planting bed and a minimum ten feet from the building’s foundation.

b.    Shrubs or small trees shall be planted minimum three to six feet on center (depending on size at maturity) within the required planting bed.

c.    Groundcover or other organic material shall be provided to reduce wind and water erosion.

B.    On-Site Pedestrian Circulation.

1.    Buildings shall be linked to their fronting street(s) with primary walkways.

2.    Primary walkways shall be a minimum of five feet in width, and must be visually distinct from parking lot and driveway surfaces. Pedestrian walkways may be of permeable surfacing when appropriate and as approved by the city engineer.

3.    Secondary walkways are those that provide for pedestrian connection between buildings without depending upon parking lots. All buildings shall be linked to each other by a secondary walkway promoting the shortest distance between building entrances. When adjacent to an undeveloped parcel, a secondary walkway shall be provided to the property line to provide future pedestrian connection separate from a future street connection. Secondary walkways do not need to be paved.

C.    Building Design Standards. The purpose of building design standards in the business and employment zoning districts is to facilitate attractive architectural design and scale by avoiding large blank walls, bright colors and providing roof line treatment. The following standards apply to building design in all three of the business and employment zoning districts. The city’s design review process applies to all proposals that require site plan review or a building permit that contains substantial building facade alteration to the exterior of an existing building. See also Chapter 18.120.

1.    Building Facades.

a.    Architectural interest is required for all building facades visible from public streets and other publicly visible areas, such as parking areas.

i.    Publicly visible building walls shall incorporate insets or offsets, canopies, colonnades, wing walls, trellises, building facade landscaping, material variation, multi-planed roof line, or other features which diminish large blank walls.

ii.    For publicly visible building walls exceeding one hundred feet in length, offset elements shall be required that break up the plane of the wall into at least three sections.

b.    Provide visual terminus to tops of buildings. To avoid a truncated appearance, all structures shall have a visual “cap.” Options include extended eaves; steep pitch hip, gable or saltbox roof form; false pitch roof with appearance of hip gable or saltbox; or projecting cornice of appropriate scale to the building and part of building’s trim detail.

c.    Primary building entrances shall be physically oriented to the street and primary pedestrian walkway. The primary entrances to structures, including all entrances to individual tenant spaces, shall be clearly identifiable through architectural design. Specific treatments include, but are not limited to, wall modulation, gables, window clusters, landscape treatment, material/color/texture change, awnings, moldings, planters, and pedestrian amenities, such as benches and tables.

2.    Materials.

a.    Facades visible from public streets or other publicly visible areas shall provide visual interest by providing a variety of building materials, windows, artwork, or other techniques. Desired materials include brick, wood, horizontal lap siding made of wood or cement-like materials; split-faced block or ground-faced block.

b.    For structures including residential (mixed use structures) or live/work units, siding materials must include but are not limited to two of the following: horizontal lap siding (of any lap design) made of wood or cement-like materials, shingles made of cedar or cement-like materials, board and batten (or panels with similarly spaced battens), brick, or stone (real or cultured). Typically, the residential component will be differentiated from the nonresidential uses by scale and amount of detailing.

3.    Color.

a.    Main color of exterior walls is limited to subtle earth tone colors. Soft white, sands, grays, muted pastels, and deep, rich earth colors (terra cotta, forest green) are acceptable.

b.    Trim color may be lighter or darker shades of the main color, soft white, or contrast or complement the main color but shall not be bright or bold.

c.    Accents or graphics may be brighter than main or trim color and shall be limited to fifteen percent of the facade area, excluding glass. Bright, high contrast color banding is limited to maximum four inches in width. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 9 (Exh. A (10-8) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.28.050)


18.90.060 Performance standards.

No land or structure shall be used or occupied unless there is compliance with the following minimum performance standards:

A.    Outdoor Storage. Outdoor storage of materials and supplies shall be completely screened with a combination of fencing and landscaping, from adjacent properties and public right-of-way, and be located in the interior of the lot to the extent possible as determined by the planning director.

B.    Emissions. Any air emissions shall meet applicable regulations of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, and no visible, frequent smoke, dust, or gases shall be emitted.

C.    Exterior Lighting. Exterior lighting, except for warning or emergency lighting, shall be hooded or shielded so illumination is directed downward and shall be confined to the property boundaries of the light source.

D.    Noise. Noise levels shall not exceed the maximum allowed in Chapter 173-60 WAC for Class B (commercial) or Class C (industrial) environmental designations as appropriate to the use, or as set forth in the International Building Code requirements.

E.    Exterior Mechanical Equipment.

1.    All HVAC equipment, pumps, heaters and other mechanical devices shall be screened from view from adjacent streets and properties.

2.    Vents, mechanical penthouses, elevator equipment and similar appurtenances may extend no more than fifteen feet above the roof line, must be surrounded by a sight-obscuring screen constructed to the same height as the mechanical equipment, and conform to the following criteria:

a.    The screen must be integrated into the architecture of the building.

b.    The screen must obscure to the extent possible the view of the appurtenances from adjacent streets and properties.

c.    Rod, wire and dish antennas are exempt from the screening requirement if the screening would interfere with the effective operation of the antenna.

F.    Odors. The emission of objectionable odors or matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable at any point beyond the property line of the use causing such odors is prohibited.

G.    Heat and Glare. Except for exterior lighting, operations producing heat and glare shall be conducted within an enclosed building.

H.    Trash dumpsters shall be screened from view with a combination of sight-obscuring fencing and vegetative screening.

I.    Ground and Soil Contamination. Materials shall be handled in such a manner to prevent ground or soil pollution, or which may contaminate aquifer or other natural drainage systems as required by state and local health agencies.

J.    Fire and Explosive Hazards. The manufacture, use, processing or storage of flammable liquids or materials, liquids or gases that produce flammable or explosive vapors or gases shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations of the adopted International Fire Code and International Building Code.

K.    In addition to the standards identified above, the city may utilize its authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), to identify additional mitigations on impacts to the environment, as determined at time of project review. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 9 (Exh. A (10-8) (part)), 2011; Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, VI(B), (C), (G)), 2003. Formerly 18.28.060, 18.60.020, 18.60.030, 18.60.070)


18.90.070 Residential uses.

A.    Mixed Use Structures. Mixed use structures allow for placement of a mix of commercial, business, employment and residential uses in a single building. Mixed use structures are intended to allow for efficient use of land and public services in an urban setting; encourage convenient access between employment, services and residential opportunities; and increase development alternatives.

1.    Permitted nonresidential uses shall be located on the ground floor. However, part of the ground floor may be used as a driveway to rear or under-grade parking, or as a pedestrian park area. Residential units must be located above allowed nonresidential uses (residences may not be located at street/ground level or below). Number of residential units shall be limited by the mixed use structure’s required development standards (lot coverage, height, parking and setbacks) for the underlying zoning district.

2.    The mixed use building shall be designed to look and function as an integrated development and encourage pedestrian travel between uses and adjacent buildings.

3.    At least one outdoor activity feature shall be provided for the mixed use building, including but not limited to courtyards, delineated gathering spaces, or seating areas. These areas may be paved and/or landscaped.

4.    A minimum of thirty-eight square feet of private open space shall be provided for each of the residential units, such as a private outdoor balcony.

5.    On-site pedestrian circulation that links the public street and the primary entrance to the structure or residential units shall be provided. When the pedestrian circulation crosses driveways, parking areas and loading areas, it must be clearly identifiable through use of different paving materials.

B.    Live/Work Units. Live/work units are allowed in the OCI zoning district, and are a building use that combines business or manufacturing activities within the same structure as a residential living space. Live/work units are distinctive from mixed use because the business owner or employee must live in the unit.

The standards established in this section apply to all adult entertainment facilities and include, but are not limited to, the following: adult arcades, adult cabarets, adult motels, adult motion picture theaters and adult retail stores. The standards established in this section shall not be construed to restrict or prohibit the following activities or products: (1) plays, operas, musicals, or other dramatic works that are not obscene; (2) classes, seminars, or lectures which are held for serious scientific or educational purposes that are not obscene; and (3) exhibitions, performances, expressions or dances that are not obscene. For the purposes of this chapter, the term “obscene” shall have the same definition as the terms “lewd matter” and “obscene matter” as those terms are defined by state law.

B.    Where Allowed. Adult entertainment facilities are allowed only in the light industrial (LI) zoning district.

C.    Separation Requirements. Adult entertainment facilities shall be permitted in the light industrial zoning district only if the following separation requirements are met:

1.    No adult entertainment facility shall be located closer than five hundred feet to any other adult entertainment facility whether or not such adult entertainment facility is located within or outside the city limits;

2.    No adult entertainment facility shall be located closer than one hundred feet to any residential zoning district whether or not such zoning district is located within or outside the city limits.

4.    Measuring of Separation Requirements. The buffers required by this section shall be measured by extending a straight line from the nearest point on the property line of the lot containing the proposed adult entertainment facility to the nearest point on the boundary line of property with zoning districts or uses identified in this subsection C.

5.    Variance for Separation Requirements. Whenever the applicant for an adult entertainment facility believes that the separation requirements set forth in this section are not necessary to achieve an effective degree of physical separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and the zoning districts and uses identified in this subsection C, the applicant shall have the right to apply for a variance from the separation requirements subject to procedures set forth in Chapter 18.290, Variances.

D.    In determining whether a variance should be granted, and if so to what extent, the review authority shall consider the following criteria in addition to the variance criteria set forth in Chapter 18.290, Variances:

1.    The extent to which physical features would result in an effective separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and any zoning districts or uses identified in subsection C of this section in terms of visibility and access;

2.    The availability or lack of alternative locations for the proposed adult entertainment facility;

3.    The ability to avoid the adult entertainment facilities by an alternative vehicular and pedestrian route(s); and

4.    The extent to which the applicant can minimize the adverse secondary effects associated with the proposed adult entertainment facility.

If, after considering these criteria and the variance criteria set forth in Chapter 18.290, the review authority finds that an effective degree of physical separation between the proposed adult entertainment facility and the zoning districts and uses identified in subsection C of this section can be achieved without requiring the full distance of separation provided by this section, the review authority shall determine the degree of variance to be allowed and shall grant the variance. Otherwise, the variance application shall be denied.

E.    Nonconforming Adult Entertainment Facilities. An adult entertainment facility shall be deemed a nonconforming use and shall be subject to the requirements of Chapter 18.160, Nonconformities, if a residential zoning district or uses identified in subsection C of this section locate within one hundred feet of such adult entertainment facility after the date that such adult entertainment facility has located within the city in accordance with the requirements of this section.

F.    Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The master plan contains design, landscaping, parking/traffic management and multi-modal transportation elements that limit conflicts between the master planned development and adjacent uses.

G.    Mitigation of Off-Site Impacts. All potential off-site impacts including but not limited to traffic, noise, light and glare, and stormwater runoff are identified and mitigated to the extent practicable.

H.    Alternative Development Standards. The master plan has identified all proposed alternative development standards and has demonstrated:

1.    The alternative development standard(s) is warranted given the site conditions and/or characteristics of the site design.

2.    The benefits accruing from the alternative development standards outweigh any potential adverse impacts.

3.    Any impacts resulting from the alternative development standards are mitigated to the extent practical. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(7)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.070)


18.110.080 Conditions of approval.

The review authority shall have the authority to impose any conditions of approval necessary to mitigate potentially adverse impacts. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.110.090 Effect of master plan approval.

The approved master plan together with all revisions, required mitigation and conditions imposed shall constitute the approved master plan, which shall be filed in the office of the city clerk. The approved master plan does not itself authorize development, but provides standards against which application for subsequent development including site plans and permits for development of property covered by the approved master plan overlay are to be reviewed. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(9)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.090)


18.110.100 Subsequent development.

A.    When a land use permit is submitted to the city for development within a master plan overlay, the planning director shall review the application for substantial compliance with the approved master plan. “Substantial compliance” shall mean the development proposal:

1.    Is within the scope and intent of the approved master plan;

2.    Is of similar size, scale, site and architectural design of the approved master plan, and does not present appreciably different environmental effects from those identified during the master plan review process;

3.    Does not reduce overall acreage identified as dedicated public areas or buffer areas, and in the case of alterations to the location of such areas, provides equal or greater benefit as compared to the area designated in the master plan; and

4.    Does not significantly change the mix and location of land uses, generation of traffic impacts, and/or major points of ingress or egress.

B.    The planning director shall give written notice to the applicant whether the proposed development substantially complies with the approved master plan. In the event the proposed development is determined not to be in substantial compliance, the notice shall specify the reason(s) for the determination and suggest action(s) that would bring the proposal into substantial compliance, including, if appropriate, the need for an amendment. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(10)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.100)


18.110.110 Approval process for subsequent development.

Any development permit sought under an approved master plan shall be subject to the provisions of Title 19. In the event site development or design standards approved as part of the master plan differ from otherwise applicable city standards, the approved master plan standards shall control. If alternative standards are not identified in the approved master plan, the applicable city standard shall control. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(11)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.110)


18.110.120 Amendment of approved master plan.

Any proposal to amend an approved master plan shall be processed as a Type III permit under the provisions of Title 19 and will be reviewed under the criteria of approval for master plans, Section 18.110.070.

A.    An amendment to an approved master plan may be proposed in conjunction with a land use development permit that was found not to be in substantial compliance.

B.    An amendment to an approved master plan may be proposed if the property owner/applicant wishes to change any of the elements of the approved master plan.

C.    Any necessary zoning map amendments may be processed with a proposed amendment. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(12)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.120)


18.110.130 Expansion of master plan overlay.

Additional land may be added to the master plan overlay through a zoning use map amendment, unless a change in the underlying land use designation is desired: then an amendment to the comprehensive plan land use map may also be necessary. When the overlay is expanded, the master plan shall be required to be amended to address the expanded area, prepared subject to the provisions of Section 18.110.050. Amendments to the master plan may occur concurrently with the map amendment process, or subsequent to that process. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.110.140 Vesting.

Development standards, site and architectural design standards identified in an approved master plan shall control for all subsequent site development as long as the approved master plan remains in effect. If alternative standards or procedures are not specifically identified in the approved master plan, the applicable city standard at the time of land use permit or subdivision submittal shall control. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(13)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.130)


18.110.150 Duration of approved master plan.

An approved master plan shall remain valid for five years, or as provided for in the master plan’s approved phasing plan. Once the master plan is commenced, the master plan is vested for the life of the project; provided, that if the master plan is constructed in phases, each phase is developed as a “stand-alone” phase, and all infrastructure necessary to support the phase is improved prior to issuance of building permits for the specific phase. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, II(G)(14)), 2003. Formerly 18.40.150)

18.125.050    Criteria for approval of essential public facilities.

18.125.060    Secure community transition facilities.


18.125.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the Growth Management Act and the Poulsbo comprehensive plan by establishing processes for the siting and expansion of essential public facilities in the city of Poulsbo as necessary to support orderly growth and delivery of public services. The city’s goal in promulgating the regulations under this chapter is to ensure the timely, efficient and appropriate siting of EPFs while simultaneously acknowledging and mitigating the significant community impacts often created by such facilities. Nothing in this chapter should be construed as an attempt by the city to preclude the siting of essential public facilities in compliance of applicable state law. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.125.020 Types of essential public facilities.

A.    Essential Public Facility, Local. A local EPF is owned, operated, or sponsored by the city of Poulsbo, a special purpose district, or another unit of local government and which serves the city-wide population. An EPF is “sponsored” by a local government when it is to be owned or operated by a nongovernmental entity pursuant to a contract with the local government to provide the EPF.

B.    Essential Public Facility, Regional. A regional EPF is owned, operated, or sponsored by Kitsap County or a regional agency whose boundaries encompass the city and which serves the county-wide population or an area that is greater than the city limits. An EPF is “sponsored” by the county or a regional agency when it is to be owned or operated by a nongovernmental entity pursuant to a contract with the county or regional agency to provide the EPF.

C.    Essential Public Facility, State. A state EPF is owned, operated, or sponsored by the state of Washington. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.125.030 Siting or expansion of local essential public facilities.

A.    A conditional use permit shall be required before any local essential public facility may be located or expanded within the city of Poulsbo, regardless of the zoning district in which such facility is or is proposed to be located, and processed consistent with Chapter 18.230.

B.    Included in a complete application for a conditional use permit shall be the following items:

1.    The project sponsor has demonstrated a need for the project, as supported by a detailed written analysis of the projected service population, an inventory of existing and planned comparable facilities, and the projected demand for the type of facility proposed.

2.    The project sponsor has reasonably investigated alternative sites, as evidenced by a detailed explanation of site selection methodology, and as verified by the city. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.125.040 Siting and expansion of state and regional essential public facilities.

A.    A proposal for the siting or expansion of a state or regional essential public facility shall follow the procedures for the underlying permit, e.g., site plan, binding site plan, subdivision, building permit, etc.; provided, that the state or regional essential public facility and its location have been evaluated through a demonstrated state or regional siting process, which included review and evaluation of alternative sites.

1.    When a proposed state or regional essential public facility has not been reviewed and evaluated through a state or regional siting process, it will be processed as a conditional use permit.

a.    When a proposed state or regional essential public facility has not been reviewed and evaluated through a state or regional siting process, the following shall be included with its conditional use permit application:

i.    The project sponsor has demonstrated a need for the project, as supported by a detailed written analysis of the projected service population, an inventory of existing and planned comparable facilities, and the projected demand for the type of facility proposed.

ii.    The project sponsor has reasonably investigated alternative sites, as evidenced by a detailed explanation of site selection methodology, and as verified by the city.

B.    Any proposal for the siting or expansion of a state or regional essential public facility shall hold a public hearing prior to the issuance of any such permit in order to obtain public input on the permit criteria and conditions of approval; provided, that a local public hearing was not previously held through the state or regional siting process.

1.    If the underlying permit ordinarily requires a public hearing, the public hearing required by this section shall be consolidated with the required public hearing and heard by the same hearing body or officer.

2.    If the underlying permit does not ordinarily require a public hearing, the review authority shall conduct the public hearing as part of the permit review process. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.125.050 Criteria for approval of essential public facilities.

A permit for a local, regional or state essential public facility shall be approved upon the satisfactory finding of the following:

A.    The proposed facility has been reviewed appropriately and has satisfied all provisions of this section, and has met all development standards of the underlying zoning district. If an essential public facility does not meet all such provisions, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with such provisions would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the review authority shall authorize the essential public facility to deviate from the provisions of this code to the minimum extent necessary to avoid preclusion.

B.    The review authority shall impose reasonable conditions upon an essential public facility in order to ensure that:

1.    Necessary infrastructure is or will be made available to ensure safe transportation access and transportation concurrency.

2.    Necessary infrastructure is or will be made available to ensure that public safety responders have capacity to handle increased calls or expenses that will occur as the result of the facility.

3.    The project sponsor has the ability to and shall pay for all capital costs associated with on-site and off-site improvements.

4.    The facility will not unreasonably increase noise levels in residential areas, especially at night.

5.    Visual screening will be provided that will mitigate the visual impacts from streets and adjoining properties. Visual screening must be of such quality and design as to complement the neighborhood in which the local essential public facility is located. Screening complements the neighborhood when it meets or exceeds the quality and design of other screening in the neighborhood.

6.    Any and all probable significant adverse environmental impacts are mitigated.

C.    The review authority shall not impose conditions in such a manner as to preclude the siting or expansion of any essential public facility in the city of Poulsbo. In the event that a state or regional essential public facility cannot, by the imposition of reasonable conditions of approval, be made to mitigate the impacts described in subsection B of this section, the review authority shall approve the siting or expansion of the state or regional essential public facility with such reasonable conditions of approval as may mitigate such impacts to the maximum extent practicable. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.125.060 Secure community transition facilities.

RCW 71.09.342 preempts any and all local regulations on the siting of secure community transition facilities as defined in RCW 71.09.020. Such facilities are therefore exempt from the provisions of this chapter and shall be sited as provided in Chapter 71.09 RCW. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)

D.    Replacement of Street Trees. Existing street trees removed shall be replaced. The replacement trees shall be of a size and species similar to the trees that are being removed unless alternatives are approved by the review authority. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.130.100 Water conservation.

A.    Applicability. In order to ensure efficient water use in landscaped areas, the following standards shall be applied to all landscaping associated with C-2, C-3, C-4, OCI, BP and LI zoning districts; multifamily residential projects; master planned projects; and commonly owned and/or maintained areas of planned residential developments.

1.    Turf and high water use plantings (e.g., annuals, container plants) shall be considered high water uses and shall be limited to not more than fifty percent of the project’s landscaped area if non-drought-resistant grass is used, and no more than seventy-five percent of the landscaped area if drought-resistant grass is used.

2.    Plants selected in all areas not identified for turf or high water use plantings shall be well-suited to the climate, soils, and topographic conditions of the site, and shall be low water use plants once established. Conifers are the preferred evergreen tree species.

3.    Plants having similar water use shall be grouped together in distinct hydrozones and shall be irrigated with separate irrigation circuits.

4.    Parks, playgrounds, sports fields, golf courses, schools, and cemeteries are exempt from specified turf area limitations where a functional need for turf is established.

B.    As an alternative to traditional landscaping, the city encourages the use of xeriscape practices, which minimize the need for watering or irrigation. If xeriscape methods are proposed, the city may consider and approve alternatives to the irrigation requirement in Section 18.130.050(A)(3). Examples of xeriscape methods are as follows:

1.    Using plants with low moisture requirements.

2.    Selecting plants for specific site microclimates that vary according to slope, aspect, soil, and exposure to sun and moisture.

3.    Using native, noninvasive, adapted plant species.

4.    Minimizing the amount of irrigated turf.

5.    Planting and designing slopes to minimize stormwater runoff.

6.    Use of separate irrigation zones adjusted to plant water requirements and use of drip or trickle irrigation systems.

7.    Using minimum three-inch mulch in planted areas to control weeds, cool the soil and reduce evaporation.

8.    Emphasizing soil improvement, such as deep tilling, adding organic matter and other amendments based on soil tests. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)

Code reviser’s note: Ordinance 2013-04 adds two sections numbered 18.140.040. This section has been editorially renumbered to avoid duplication of numbering. 


Chapter 18.150 MEASUREMENTS

Sections:

18.150.010    Purpose.

18.150.020    Measuring minimum requirements.

18.150.030    Measuring required setbacks.

18.150.040    Measuring lot width and depth.

18.150.050    Measuring building height.

18.150.060    Measuring building stepback.


18.150.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to set the standards for calculating measurements required in this title. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.150.020 Measuring minimum requirements.

When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, including but not limited to parking spaces or number of plants required, any fractional result above and including one-half will be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number; and any fractional result below one-half will be rounded down to the next consecutive whole number. (See also Section 18.70.040 for measuring minimum number of dwelling units.) (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.150.030 Measuring required setbacks.

A setback is measured from the interior edge of a street right-of-way, access easement or private road. Where there is no street right-of-way, access easement or private road, a setback is measured from the property line. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.150.040 Measuring lot width and depth.

Lot widths and depths are measured from the midpoints of opposite lot lines.

Chapter 18.160 NONCONFORMITIES

Sections:

18.160.010    Purpose.

18.160.020    Nonconforming uses.

18.160.030    Nonconforming structures.

18.160.040    Nonconforming lot of record.

18.160.050    Nonconforming site.

18.160.070    Continuation of prior conditional use permits and variances.

18.160.080    Applicability to property regulated under the shoreline master program.


18.160.010 Purpose.

Within the zoning districts established by this title or any amendment later adopted, there may exist lots, structures, and uses of land that were lawful before the effective date of the applicable regulations, but that would be restricted, regulated or prohibited under the terms of this title or future amendment. This chapter is intended to permit these nonconformities to continue as is until they are removed but not to encourage their perpetuation. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, IX(A)), 2003. Formerly 18.88.010)


18.160.020 Nonconforming uses.

A.    A nonconforming use is the use of a structure or land that does not conform to the regulations of the district in which the use exists, usually due to changes in zoning ordinance requirements or annexation.

B.    A nonconforming use may continue by successive owners or tenants; provided, however, that the nonconforming use may not be intensified.

C.    If a nonconforming use of a structure or land is discontinued for a period of twelve months or greater, the use is presumed abandoned, unless a contrary intent is proven by the property owner. Any subsequent use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. Discontinuation of use shall be evidenced by at least one of the following:

1.    When normal occupancy and/or use has ceased.

2.    When characteristic furnishings and equipment associated with the use have been removed and not replaced with equivalent furnishings and equipment.

3.    When there are no business receipts available for the twelve-month period.

D.    A structure that houses a nonconforming use may not be expanded, redeveloped, or relocated unless the nonconforming use is eliminated; provided, that normal maintenance and repair are allowed. No additional structure(s) may be erected in association with the nonconforming use.

E.    The planning director may allow a nonconforming use of a structure or land to be substituted with a different nonconforming use, upon determining that:

1.    The replacement use will not adversely affect the character of the zone in which it is proposed to be located;

2.    The proposed use is more consistent with the zone than the existing nonconforming use; and

3.    The replacement use will not result in enlargement of the space occupied by the existing nonconforming use.

F.    If a structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged by sudden and unforeseeable events out of the property owner’s control, such as fires or windstorms, the nonconforming use may continue and the structure may be reconstructed to the same or smaller configuration existing prior to the time the structure was damaged or destroyed. A building permit must be applied with the city within twelve months of the event and shall comply with all applicable building codes in force at the time of repair or reconstruction; provided, that the city council may extend this twelve-month period if extenuating circumstances (e.g., insurance litigation) have prevented the applicant from applying for permits. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, IX(B), (C), (E)), 2003. Formerly 18.88.020, 18.88.030, 18.88.050)


18.160.030 Nonconforming structures.

A.    A nonconforming structure is a structure which does not conform to the dimensional regulations, including but not limited to setback, height, lot coverage, density and building configuration regulations, of the district in which it is located, usually due to changes in zoning ordinance requirements or annexation.

B.    A structure nonconforming to the dimensional standards of this title may not be expanded, redeveloped or relocated unless the enlarged area or alteration is in conformance with the requirements of the zone in which it is located.

C.    Routine maintenance and repairs are permissible; provided, they are restricted to the repairs or replacement of structural elements, fixtures, wiring and plumbing required so as to protect occupants and public safety. The need for such repairs or replacements shall be confirmed by the building official.

D.    A nonconforming structure damaged by sudden and unforeseeable events out of the property owner’s control, such as fires or windstorms, may be reconstructed up to the original size, placement and density. A building permit must be applied with the city within twelve months of the event and shall comply with all applicable building codes in force at the time of repair or reconstruction; provided, that the city council may extend this twelve-month period if extenuating circumstances (e.g., insurance litigation) have prevented the applicant from applying for permits.

E.    A nonconforming structure that is damaged by property owner initiation or has deteriorated due to lack of maintenance or repair may be restored only to conform to the applicable provisions of its zoning district.

F.    Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety and upon order of such official. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, IX(D)), 2003. Formerly 18.88.040)


18.160.040 Nonconforming lot of record.

A.    A nonconforming legal lot is a lot that does not conform to the area, width, depth or street frontage regulations of the district in which it is located, usually due to changes in zoning ordinance requirements, condemnation or annexation.

B.    In any zoning district, permitted uses and structures may be erected on any lot that is of record; provided, that the permitted structures shall be erected on a nonconforming lot so that all dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is located are complied with, or a variance has been granted.

C.    The planning director may request evidence that demonstrates that the lot is a legal lot of record.

D.    Two or more legally nonconforming lots may be combined, even if the resulting lot does not satisfy the minimum lot area requirement in the underlying zoning district, as long as the planning director determines that there is sufficient evidence that the lots are legal lots of record and the combination brings the lot(s) closer to conformance of the minimum lot area. A boundary line adjustment will be required to combine legal lots.

E.    A nonconforming lot of record cannot, through boundary line adjustments or other provisions, become further nonconforming. The reconfiguration of lot(s) from a nonconforming lot(s), or into new lot creation, shall meet minimum and maximum lot area requirements as set forth in Section 18.70.040, and lot standards in Table 18.70.050, unless a variance has been granted. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.160.050 Nonconforming site.

A.    A nonconforming site is a lot which does not conform to site development regulations, including but not limited to landscaping, parking, fencing, driveway, street openings, pedestrian amenities, screening, and curb cut requirements, of the district in which it is located, usually due to changes in zoning ordinance requirements or annexation.

B.    A nonconforming site may not be changed as to the site characteristics, unless the change conforms to the regulations of the underlying zoning districts; provided, that parking lot striping may be reconfigured within the existing paved surface.

C.    Upon expansion of any structure or complex of structures within a single site of over twenty-five percent of the existing floor area, the site shall be brought into compliance with the underlying zoning district’s site development standards. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.160.060 Existing single-family detached residences in nonresidential zoning districts.

A.    Existing single-family detached residences located in nonresidential zoning districts may continue by successive owners or tenants; provided, that no increase in unit density is allowed, including adding accessory dwelling units. Special uses related to the existing residence, such as home occupations or home day care, may be allowed and are regulated as appropriate, as set forth in Section 18.70.070.

B.    Existing single-family detached residences and accessory structures may be repaired, remodeled, maintained, or relocated but may not be enlarged or intensified.

C.    If the existing single-family detached residence is discontinued in its residential use for more than twelve months, it shall lose its ability to continue, and will be considered an abandoned nonconforming use subject to the provisions of Section 18.160.020, unless a contrary intent is proven by the property owner.

D.    If the existing single-family detached residence is damaged by sudden and unforeseeable events out of the property owner’s control, such as fires or windstorms, it may be reconstructed up to the original size, placement and density. A building permit must be applied with the city within twelve months of the event and shall comply with all applicable building codes in force at the time of repair or reconstruction; provided, that the city council may extend this twelve-month period if extenuating circumstances (e.g., insurance litigation) have prevented the applicant from applying for permits.

E.    Existing residential units in a nonresidential zone that are located within a mixed use structure will be considered allowed as mixed use, and are not subject to the nonconforming provisions. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.160.070 Continuation of prior conditional use permits and variances.

Any valid conditional use or variance granted prior to the effective date of the enactment of this title shall be permitted to continue in accordance with such use or variance. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.160.080 Applicability to property regulated under the shoreline master program.

Property within the jurisdiction of the Shoreline Management Act shall also be regulated by the shoreline master program regulations, Section 16.08.480, nonconformities. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)

F.    Encourage the collocation or attachment of wireless communications antennas on existing support structures or to help minimize the total number and impact of such structures throughout the community. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.200.020 General provisions.

A.    Wireless telecommunication facilities shall not be considered nor regulated as essential public facilities.

B.    Wireless telecommunication facilities may be either a principal or secondary use. A different use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of a wireless telecommunication facility. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.200.030 Applicability.

A.    Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be permitted as established in the underlying zoning district use table.

B.    The following are exempt from the provisions of this chapter:

1.    Wireless communication facilities utilized by a governmental agency for governmental purposes and not for resale or lease to the public within its area of jurisdiction.

2.    Amateur radio towers and antenna arrays to the full extent necessary to entitle the holder of the license to utilize the rights granted by the Federal Communications Commission; provided, that this exemption applies only if an antenna and supporting structure which must be greater than thirty-five feet in height in order for the full enjoyment of licensed activity is of a telescoping or crank-up configuration and which, when not in use, is fully retracted to a level at or below thirty-five feet in height.

3.    Television antennas, television dish antenna array and similar small-scale communication antenna array less than ten feet in height. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.200.040 Location considerations.

The location priority for new wireless telecommunication facilities shall be in the following order:

A.    In all zoning districts, co-locate on existing wireless telecommunication facilities.

B.    In all zoning districts, co-locate antennas within rights-of-way and existing structures (i.e., power poles); or other existing structures, such as buildings, water towers.

C.    Place new wireless telecommunication facilities over twenty-one feet in height in districts zoned C-2, C-3, C-4, OCI, BP or LI.

D.    Place within residential zoning districts only when co-locating or an applicant has proven that:

1.    There is a significant gap in the applicant’s service coverage that will be left unfilled if the facility is not located in the residential zoning district; and

2.    Alternative facilities or sites in higher priority areas have been investigated and determined not to be technically feasible, as demonstrated by an alternative sites evaluation prepared by the applicant and submitted to the city as provided in Section 18.200.050(J). (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)


18.200.050 Application requirements.

In addition to other applicable requirements, applications shall include the following:

A.    Site and landscape plans drawn to scale, including the location of existing structures, trees, and other significant site features; proposed color of the facility; method of fencing; finished color and, if applicable, the method of camouflage and illumination.

B.    A report including description of the facility with technical reasons for its design.

C.    Documentation establishing the structural integrity for the facility’s proposed use.

D.    The general capacity of the tower and information necessary to assure that ANSI standards are met.

E.    A statement of intent on whether the excess space on the facility will be leased.

F.    Proof of ownership of the proposed site or authorization to utilize it.

G.    Copies of any easements necessary.

H.    An analysis of the area containing existing topographical contours.

I.    Photo simulations of the proposed facility from affected properties and public rights-of-way at varying distances.

J.    When proposed not to co-locate, an alternative sites evaluation outlining all potential sites investigated, including at a minimum all priority locations as listed in Section 18.200.040. The evaluation shall address how co-locating on all existing wireless facilities within a one-mile radius, or locating on other facilities or structure/building locations within one-half-mile radius of the proposed facility location, does not satisfy the operational requirements of the application.

1.    The city may retain, at the applicant’s expense, an independent consultant to review the alternative sites evaluation submitted by the applicant. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, III(X)), 2003. Formerly 18.48.240)


18.200.060 Development standards.

A.    Landscaping and Screening.

1.    In all zones, equipment shelters, cabinets and other on-the-ground ancillary equipment shall be constructed with a use separation buffer of a minimum of twenty feet in R zones and ten feet in all other zones. The review authority may increase the width of this buffer if it is determined additional buffering is necessary to further mitigate the impact of the ground equipment. Further, the buffer shall be contained in a recorded easement; vegetation shall not be removed without approval by the city.

2.    Fencing shall be required around the ground facilities and be located within the required separation buffer. The fence shall be a nonobtrusive material such as a dark coated chain link fence to blend in with the surroundings.

3.    In R zones, and in other zones where the wireless telecommunication facility over twenty feet in height is proposed and is within three hundred feet of an R zone, the ground level view of support structures shall be mitigated by the retention of existing trees with sufficient height that will provide a functional screen of a substantial portion of the facility. Additional landscaping and screening may be required by the review authority to mitigate the visual impact of the ground level view of the support structure, if the existing trees do not provide an adequate functional screen or if no trees are on the subject site to provide the functional screen. Existing trees on adjacent properties or within right-of-way cannot be utilized to meet this requirement.

4.    A performance and/or maintenance bond is required for all landscaping and screening plantings to ensure the required screening remains intact.

B.    Visual Impact.

1.    Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be camouflaged by employing the best available technology. This may be accomplished by use of compatible materials, location, color, stealth technologies, and/or other strategies to achieve minimum visibility of the facility as viewed from public streets or residential properties. When attached to an existing building, the wireless telecommunication facility shall be placed and colored to blend into the architectural detail and coloring of the structure.

2.    New wireless telecommunication facilities above twenty feet shall not be considered compatible with surrounding land uses if within a one-mile radius it results in more than a moderate visual impact upon a significant viewscape, such as mountain views, views of Liberty Bay, and/or open expansive views, such as valleys. Visual impact on typical Pacific Northwest viewscape of mature evergreen trees does not constitute more than moderate visual impact. The assessment for compatibility will be made through review of a visual impact analysis.

3.    A visual impact analysis will be required when a new wireless telecommunication facility is proposed to be located within an R zone or within three hundred feet of an R zone, or if the facility is anticipated to constitute more than a moderate visual impact as described above. The impact analysis will be accomplished through: (a) erection of a crane; (b) a balloon (of a size not less than four feet); or (c) similar device used to simulate the proposed dimensions and height of the structure.

4.    Ten working days prior to the demonstration, the applicant shall notify the city and provide a courtesy informational notice to properties within three hundred feet of the subject site upon which the visual impact test will be conducted. The potential impact shall be documented through submittal of maps, photographs, photo-simulation, and other appropriate methods.

C.    Color and Lighting.

1.    Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be painted in a nonreflective, earth tone color that best allows them to blend into the surroundings.

2.    Flashing red, solid red, or white strobe lighting shall not be allowed on any support structure except those included in permanent 911 public safety communication facilities, located at ground elevations above seven hundred feet, and more than one-half mile from any residential zone. Any structure subsequently determined by the FAA to require flashing red, solid red, or white strobe lighting shall be altered to avoid the lighting requirements.

3.    Security lighting which is appropriately down shielded and is directed away from adjoining properties is permitted for the equipment shelters, cabinets, and/or other ground ancillary equipment. No more than one foot-candle of illumination may leave the property boundaries.

D.    Electromagnetic Field/Radio-Frequency Radiation Standards. Installation of wireless telecommunication facilities shall conform to the standards required by the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) regulations and the Telecommunication Act of 1996.

E.    Co-Location of Facilities. All new wireless telecommunication facilities shall be designed to accommodate co-location of at least two additional carriers. Further, an approved wireless telecommunication provider cannot deny a wireless provider the ability to co-locate on an approved facility at a fair market value or at another cost agreed to by the affected parties.

F.    Discontinuation of Use. Any wireless telecommunication facility that is no longer needed and its use is discontinued shall be reported immediately by the service provider to the city. Discontinued facilities shall be completely removed by the service provider or the property owner within six months from the time of discontinuance. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2003-10 § 1 (Exh. A, III(X)), 2003. Formerly 18.48.240)


18.200.070 Conditional use findings.

In addition to the conditional use findings required in Section 18.230.060, the following findings relative to wireless telecommunication facilities are hereby required:

A.    An evaluation of the provider’s service coverage area has adequately demonstrated that there is a significant gap in the provider’s coverage that will be filled by the proposed wireless telecommunication facility.

B.    The proposed wireless telecommunication facility is co-locating or is located in a nonresidential zoning district.

C.    That the proposed wireless telecommunication facility located within an R zone is co-locating; or has adequately evaluated locational priorities, and has demonstrated that there is no technically feasible alternative facility or site in a higher priority area that will fill an existing significant gap in the provider’s coverage.

D.    The proposed wireless telecommunication facility and ground facilities have been reviewed appropriately, have satisfied all the provisions of this chapter and have been adequately mitigated. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013)

18.230.010 Purpose.

A conditional use permit is a mechanism by which the city may require special conditions on development or on the use of land in order to ensure that designated uses or activities are compatible with other uses in the same land use district and in the vicinity of the subject property. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.010)


18.230.020 Types of conditional use permit applications.

There are two types of conditional use permits. An administrative conditional use permit (AC) application shall be processed as a Type II permit application; a conditional use permit (C) shall be processed as a Type III (quasi-judicial) permit application. Both Type II and Type III permits shall be processed according to the provisions of Title 19. Land uses and development actions requiring an AC or C shall be identified in use tables in each respective zoning district. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.020)


18.230.030 Review authority.

The review authority for an administrative conditional use permit application (AC) shall be the planning director, and the review authority for a conditional use permit application (C) shall be the hearing examiner, according to the provisions of Title 19. However, the planning director may elect to have any administrative conditional use permit application processed as a Type III conditional use permit application based on unusual characteristics of the land use or development proposal, special characteristics of the area in which they are to be located, or anticipated significant impacts to the surrounding property, neighborhood, or the city as a whole.

If an administrative conditional use permit application is submitted concurrently with any Type III permit application, the applications shall be subject to one combined Type III review and approval process. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.030)


18.230.040 Conditions authorized.

In permitting a conditional use, the review authority may impose, in addition to regulations and standards expressly specified in this title, other conditions found necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding property(ies), neighborhood, and the city as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not limited to:

A.    Requirements increasing the required lot size or yard dimensions;

B.    Increasing street widths, controlling the location and number of vehicular access points to the property;

C.    Increasing the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required;

D.    Limiting the number of signs;

E.    Limiting the coverage or height of buildings or structures because of obstructions to view and reduction of light and air to adjacent property;

F.    Limiting or prohibiting openings in sides of buildings or structures or requiring screening and landscaping where necessary to reduce noise and glare and maintain the property in a character in keeping with the surrounding area; and

G.    Requirements under which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the city and new conditions imposed. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.040)


18.230.050 Neighborhood meeting.

When the subject site is within or adjacent to a residential zoning district, a neighborhood meeting is required to be conducted by the applicant for a conditional use permit (C) permit and may be required by the planning director for an administrative conditional use permit (AC). Procedures for the neighborhood meeting are identified in Title 19. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.050)


18.230.060 Decision criteria.

The review authority may approve, or approve with conditions, the application for a conditional use permit, if it meets the following criteria. Applications that do not meet all decision criteria will be denied.

A.    The conditional use will not be materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity of the subject property; and

B.    The design is compatible with and responds to the existing or intended character, appearance, quality of development and physical characteristics of the subject property and immediate vicinity; and

C.    The conditional use will be served by adequate public facilities including streets, fire protection and utilities; and

D.    The conditional use complies with all applicable requirements of this code. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.060)


18.230.070 Limitations of permit.

A.    An AC permit or a C permit shall become void two years after approval, or after such greater or lesser time as may be specified as a condition of approval, unless within that time the required building construction, alteration or enlargement has been commenced and diligently pursued, or if no such construction, alteration or enlargement is required, that the permitted use is regularly conducted on the premises. The planning director may extend the permit for one one-year extension.

B.    In a case where an application is denied by the review authority and specifically stated to be without prejudice, it shall not be eligible for resubmittal for the period of one year from the date of said denial, unless, in the opinion of the review authority, new evidence is submitted or conditions have changed to an extent that further consideration is warranted. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.070)


18.230.080 Appeal.

18.230.090 Modification/revocation by review authority.

The city may initiate a modification or revocation of an approved administrative conditional use permit and conditional use permit.

A.    Modification. The city may initiate a modification to an approved AC or C permit through a Type II process as set forth in Title 19. The review authority of the original permit may delete, modify or impose additional conditions upon finding that the use for which such approval was granted has been intensified, changed or modified by the property owner or by person(s) who control the property without approval so as to significantly impact surrounding land uses.

B.    Revocation. The city may revoke an approved AC or C permit through a Type III process as set forth in Title 19. The review authority may revoke an approved permit only upon finding that:

1.    Approval of the permit was obtained by misrepresentation of material fact; or

2.    The permit is being exercised contrary to the terms of approval. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.090)


18.230.100 Revisions.

A.    Minor Revisions. The planning director may approve a minor revision to an approved AC or C permit. Minor revisions are those that entail changes by no more than twenty percent to any approved or existing numeric standard.

Minor revisions will be processed as a Type II permit, and must meet the following decision criteria:

1.    The minor revision maintains the intent or purpose of the original approval;

2.    The amendment is not materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity of the subject property; and

3.    The amendment complies with all applicable development regulations.

The planning director may include conditions as part of approving minor revisions.

B.    Major Revisions. Any revision to an approved AC or C permit that changes by twenty-one percent or more, any approved or existing numeric standard, or has been determined by the planning director to increase impacts to the surrounding property or neighborhood, is considered a major revision, and is treated as a new application. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2011-02 § 14 (Exh. A (10-13) (part)), 2011. Formerly 18.76.100)

Except as set forth below, a tract of land to be developed as a planned residential development shall have a minimum of five acres. However, a smaller site size may be allowed if the review authority makes specific findings to support the conclusion that a planned residential development is in the public interest because one or more of the following conditions apply:

A.    The site contains critical areas and their protected buffers, as defined and set forth by the city’s critical areas ordinance.

B.    A physical and/or topographic feature of importance identified through a site analysis (such as but not limited to rock croppings, significant stands of trees, and areas of cultural resources) exists on the site or in the neighborhood, which can be conserved and still leave the applicant adequate land for use by the planned residential development.

C.    The property or its neighborhood has a historical character of importance to the community that will be protected by use of a planned residential development.

D.    The property is adjacent to or across the street from property which has been developed or redeveloped under a planned residential development, and a planned residential development will contribute to or supplement the existing amenities, open space and values of the neighboring planned residential development.

E.    The planned residential development design contains unique or innovative design concepts that could not be achieved without a planned residential development.

F.    The proposed planned residential development is located in the RM or RH zoning district, or is adjacent to RM, RH, C or LI zoning district(s) on at least two sides of the subject site. Further, adequate perimeter landscaping, buffering or other compatibility provisions must be able to be provided through project design.

18.260.060 PRD development standards.

A.    Lot Sizes. When a PRD subdivision has an average lot size of four thousand square feet or less, a variety of lot sizes are desired to provide for market variety, clustering and creativity. The PRD design shall include at least three different lot size ranges distributed throughout the PRD. The applicant must demonstrate to the review authority how this requirement has been met through the required written narrative.

B.    Alleys. If a unit abuts an alley, the garage shall take access from the alley whenever possible. When parking is accessed from the rear of the lot, garages must be separated at least twenty-five feet from garage face to garage face in order to provide safe vehicle backout room.

C.    Privacy. Dwellings on lots without direct frontage on a public street should be situated to respect the privacy of abutting homes and to create usable private yard space for the dwelling(s). The review authority shall have the ability/discretion during the review process to establish alternate setbacks in order to accomplish this objective.

D.    Project Design. Site design for the entire project (including open space areas, recreational amenities, any attached units and/or condominium areas, and building architectural renderings) shall be submitted in support of the proposed PRD. The renderings shall include possible footprint locations and housing elevations or generally identified architectural style. Open space areas and preliminary location of active recreational amenities, trails, conceptual landscaping and other amenities shall also be identified.

E.    Individual Identity. Home individuality shall be achieved through the following methods:

1.    When lots front on a public street, the house shall have windows and doors that face the street. Houses shall have a distinct entry feature such as a porch or weather-covered entryway.

2.    When lots front on a public street, garage doors must not be the dominant feature of the building facade. At least two of the following design elements shall be provided on home designs that have the garage door projecting forward from the first level living space:

a.    Windows in gables or dormers above the garage doors.

b.    Covered porches that emphasize the front entry.

c.    Trellis in front of garage.

d.    Additional front yard landscaping.

e.    Variety of architectural elements incorporated into the front building facade design, such as knee braces, varied column types, window boxes, corbels, and raised panel garage doors with windows.

The same building plans cannot be utilized on consecutive lots. “Flip-flopping” of plans does not satisfy this requirement and is not permitted on immediately adjacent lots.

3.    Varied architectural design features (such as roof line articulation, color and materials) and home placements shall be utilized to avoid appearance of a long row of identical homes.

4.    At building permit application submittal, the planning director will review submitted building permits for compliance with this section, as well as substantial compliance with the conceptual architectural renderings required in subsection D of this section, Project Design.

5.    The planning director has the ability to modify any of the standards within this subsection, if the subject site topography precludes the compliance with any of the stated standards.

F.    Landscaping. Landscaping in a minimum ten-foot-wide strip shall be provided on site and visible along all public street frontage classified as a neighborhood collector. The landscaping can be provided through a landscape easement on lots. If the landscaping is provided in an open space tract and maintained by a homeowners’ association, it may contribute to the project’s open space requirement. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-25 § 1 (part), 2007. Formerly 18.80.060)


18.260.070 Planned residential development site design criteria.

A.    When a PRD is proposed adjacent to an existing single-family residential zone which has been developed utilizing traditional city subdivision development standards and lot sizes (seven thousand five hundred square feet or larger), the PRD shall be designed and developed so as to be consistent with the single-family residential environment at its adjacent perimeter. The review authority may require the PRD to make provisions such as matching lot sizes, lot widths or house height and scale (or other provisions as deemed appropriate) for those lots that are located adjacent to the existing subdivision. Further, any proposed attached units shall be clustered and located away from the established single-family subdivision.

B.    When a PRD is proposed adjacent to a single-family residential zone (developed or un/underdeveloped), the perimeter of the PRD shall be subject to screening provisions (this is in addition to subsection A of this section as applicable). The review authority may require the PRD to make such provisions as providing a six-foot sight-obscuring fence or a minimum twenty-five-foot vegetated buffer (designated as an open space tract), or other provisions as deemed appropriate to provide adequate screening.

C.    Undeveloped parcels that are cleared within five years prior to the filing of a PRD application, and where no substantial stands of existing trees or natural features exist, shall not qualify for a PRD unless the proposed design warrants consideration under the PRD provisions, or significant landscaping is proposed to mitigate the loss of natural vegetation. This determination will be made by the planning director during the pre-application process. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-25 § 1 (part), 2007. Formerly 18.80.070)


18.260.080 Residential types in residential low (RL) zoning district.

Attached dwellings, not to exceed fourplexes, may be allowed in the RL zone through a PRD if the proposal meets the following criteria:

A.    The overall site density does not exceed the zoning district maximum or the allowable density bonus.

B.    The attached units must be clustered and located within the interior of the project, along street frontages, or other areas which are appropriate and compatible with adjacent residential zones.

C.    The attached units must be single-family in appearance.

D.    Architectural renderings of the attached units must be submitted with the application. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-25 § 1 (part), 2007. Formerly 18.80.080)


18.260.090 Open space requirements.

Common open space and other appropriate beneficial features are required for all planned residential developments.

A.    Open space is intended to benefit the occupants of the planned residential development and shall be improved with recreational amenities.

B.    The open space design shall be appropriate to the size, natural features and topography of the subject site. The design shall include open space that is accessible for all residents through pedestrian connections. Further, the open space area(s) shall be visible to at least half of the home sites. This may require multiple open space areas.

C.    Open space is required based on the average lot size in the proposed development. The greater the deviation from the RL standard lot size, the greater the open space requirement. This relationship is intended to mitigate the effects of smaller lot sizes including reduced recreation space on private lots, reduced setbacks between structures and overall intensity of the development. The required open space is a percentage of the gross project area.

D.    The amount of open space required is set forth in Table 18.260.090.A. The amount of open space required is based upon a range of proposed average lot sizes. The determination of average lot size shall be the sum of all individual lot square footage, divided by the total number of proposed lots.

Table 18.260.090.A—Amount of Open Space Required for PRD Subdivisions  

	Proposed Average Lot Size	Required Amount of Open Space (of gross project area)

	4,499 or smaller	20%

	4,500—5,499	15%

	5,500—6,499	10%

	6,500—7,499	5%

E.    For PRDs where no individual lots are proposed (i.e., commonly held ownership/condominium), the amount of open space required is tied to the proposed intensity of the PRD, so that as a project increases the number of units, the open space amount also increases in order to compensate for the loss of private yards and privacy, as well as providing for light, air, space, and recreational amenities throughout the PRD design. The amount of open space required shall be based upon the number of units as prescribed below:

Table 18.260.090.B—Amount of Open Space Required for Commonly Held Ownership (Condominium) Development  

	Number of Units	Required Amount of Open Space (of gross project area)

	1—40 units	5%

	41—80 units	10%

	81—110 units	15%

	111 or greater units	20%

F.    For projects with a combination of individual lots and units on commonly held ownership, total amount of open space required is cumulative. The amount of open space required shall be calculated using Tables 18.260.090.A and 18.260.090.B percentage requirements for each respective area (i.e., area(s) of common ownership tract percentage and remainder of site percentage). Each area’s acreage requirement shall then be combined for the project’s total open space requirement.

G.    Critical area protection areas and required buffers as defined and required by the city’s adopted critical areas ordinance can contribute to the above-required open space amount.

1.    If less than twenty-five percent of the subject site contains protected critical areas and required buffers, then the critical area and protected buffer area may contribute up to forty percent of the project’s required open space amount, credited on a square-foot-by-square-foot basis.

2.    If twenty-five percent to forty percent of the subject site contains protected critical areas and required buffers, then the critical area and protected buffer area may contribute up to fifty percent of the project’s required open space amount, credited on a square-foot-by-square-foot basis.

3.    If forty-one percent or greater of the subject site contains protected critical areas and required buffers, then the critical area and protected buffer area may contribute up to sixty percent of the project’s required open space amount, credited on a square-foot-by-square-foot basis.

H.    Stormwater management facilities may contribute to a project’s required open space amount under the following circumstances:

1.    For projects that utilize low impact development (LID) techniques for their stormwater management, the planning director may consider on a case-by-case basis, with demonstration that the LID technique will beneficially contribute to a project’s open space and/or landscaping and can be maintained and operated as passive open space, allowing an area of the LID technique to contribute towards the project’s passive open space requirement.

2.    For projects that utilize stormwater vaults, the top of the vault may be proposed to also serve as an active recreational amenity (i.e., sport court), if grade and landscaping provide for a usable area. The area proposed to serve as the active amenity can therefore contribute toward the open space requirement.

I.    Open space areas not proposed to be improved with recreational amenities or purposes shall remain as natural vegetation or landscaped with groundcover, shrubs and trees consistent with the type and location of open space. Removal of natural vegetation in preserved and approved open space shall only be permitted for public safety reasons and upon review and approval of the planning director and city arborist. Enhancement of critical area buffer vegetation shall be as allowed and prescribed in Chapter 16.20, Critical Areas. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-25 § 1 (part), 2007. Formerly 18.80.090)


18.260.100 Amenities required.

A.    Both passive and active recreational amenities (owned and maintained by the homeowners) are required to be provided for all PRDs, and shall be located within the required open space areas.

B.    Table 18.260.100 shall provide guidance on the type of passive and active amenities in proposed PRDs. At a minimum, the following shall be provided:

1.    PRDs with less than fifty-one units shall provide at least two Group 1 amenities.

2.    PRDs with fifty-one to eighty units shall provide one Group 1 amenity and one Group 2 amenity.

3.    PRDs with eighty-one to one hundred ten units shall provide two Group 1 amenities and two Group 2 amenities.

4.    PRDs with one hundred eleven units or more shall provide three Group 1 amenities and two Group 2 amenities.

Table 18.260.100—Types of Passive and Active Recreational Amenities  

	Passive	Active

	Group 1 Amenities	Group 1 Amenities

	Picnic areas with improved seating area and at least 2 picnic tables, in conjunction with an open play area	Multipurpose sport court or other type of sport court (pickleball, shuffleboard, etc.)

	Nature interpretative areas/viewing areas with trail and educational signage	Swimming pool and spa

	Any other comparable passive recreation use as approved by the review authority	Any other comparable active recreation use as approved by the review authority

C.    The location of the recreational amenities shall be distributed throughout the PRD for use by all residents unless clustering related amenities will result in recreational opportunities which contribute to the project’s overall recreational plan and provisions (i.e., a playfield located adjacent to a clubhouse, or walking paths and gazebo in conjunction with viewing areas).

D.    All PRD amenity design shall take into consideration and provide, when feasible, pedestrian linkages and connectivity between adjacent properties consistent with the city’s Urban Paths of Poulsbo map. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-25 § 1 (part), 2007. Formerly 18.80.100)


18.260.110 Residential density incentives.

The applicant may request an increase in the density permitted by the underlying zoning district in exchange for public benefits through land dedications and facility improvements to help achieve comprehensive plan goals of creation of quality neighborhoods, affordable housing, public facility acquisition and improvement, low impact development techniques, environmentally responsible design, and pedestrian and walkability improvements.

A.    The density incentive is expressed as additional bonus dwelling units earned per amount of public benefit provided. When a range is specified, the additional bonus dwelling units will be determined by the planning director during project review, based upon the criteria established in Table 18.260.110 for those public benefits.

B.    Bonus dwelling units may be earned through any combination from Table 18.260.110; however, bonus units cannot exceed twenty-five percent increase above maximum density allowed in the underlying zoning district.

C.    When bonus dwelling units are proposed, a PRD cannot also include accessory dwelling units within the proposed project.

18.260.120 Street standard alternatives.

The city’s street standards, as set forth in the city’s adopted Developer’s Guide, Section 2, may be modified as provided below:

A.    On-street parking as required in local access streets table may be clustered at a ratio of one-half parking space per unit. The clustered parking spaces shall be located in parking bays adjacent to a public street or within commonly owned areas. The parking bays shall be sized to appropriate parking stall sizes. The parking bays shall be owned and maintained by the project’s homeowners’ association.

B.    Private roads may serve up to nine single-family lots. Private roads must be a minimum of sixteen feet wide for two-way traffic and ten feet wide for one-way traffic (or as otherwise required by the fire department). Additional roadway width may be required if determined necessary for safe vehicle movement, to accommodate grading or other considerations as determined by the city engineer.

1.    Private roads shall be placed in a commonly owned tract. The tract will be owned and maintained by the project’s homeowners’ association. Covenants, conditions and restrictions (CCRs) and sales contracts for lots abutting private roads must indicate that the private roads are owned and maintained by the project’s homeowners’ association.

2.    Private roads must gain access from public streets constructed to city standards.

3.    If fire department access is to be met by a private road, the proposed private road must meet fire department design standards.

4.    A sidewalk on one side of the private road built to city construction standards is required.

5.    Private roads shall be paved full-width for their entire length. Asphalt and subgrade thickness must meet city construction standards.

6.    A ten-foot utility easement may be required on the outside of the private road.

7.    Stormwater collection shall meet city standards. However, the city engineer may allow modifications such as an inverted crown or a thickened asphalt edge rather than curb; provided, that stormwater treatment will be adequate and safety will not be compromised. A geotechnical analysis of the proposed private road may be required at the discretion of the review engineer.

8.    No on-street parking is allowed on private roads unless provided in eight-foot-wide bulb-outs or in parking bays sized to appropriate parking stall sizes. CCRs and sales contracts for lots abutting private streets must indicate no on-street parking is allowed if provisions for parking are not made.

C.    Alleys are only permitted as secondary access in planned residential developments. Alleys will be considered private roads and must meet the requirements in subsection B of this section with the following exceptions: alleys may provide secondary access for up to fifteen units, and a sidewalk on one side will not be required.

D.    Sidewalks separated from public streets or private roads may be required by the city engineer upon review of the project lot widths and proposed driveway locations.

E.    These specific modifications to the city’s Developer’s Guide may be utilized in PRD site design, and do not require prior city council approval in order for the application to proceed to the review authority. The PRD application remains subject to the Type III review process. However, any other modifications to the street standards that may be proposed are subject to the process set forth in the city’s Developer’s Guide, Section 2. (Ord. 2013-04 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 2007-25 § 1 (part), 2007. Formerly 18.80.120)

18.310.050 Exceptions for housing authorities.

A.    Purpose. This section is established under the authority of Chapter 35.83 RCW, which permits cities and other state public bodies to establish such exceptions to building, housing and development codes as the city council deems appropriate. The purpose of the statute is to provide for the cooperation of the city with the goals and objectives of the housing authority as set forth in RCW 35.83.010 and various state and federal programs for the development of low income housing. This chapter is established in order to provide clear criteria for the review of such applications and to provide for adequate public input.

B.    Application, Project Review, Hearing Notice, Commission Recommendation and City Council Action. Applications for housing authority development permits shall be made in accordance with Type III permit procedures established in Title 19. The provisions of that chapter shall also govern the recording of any approved plan, the expiration of such approvals as well as any and all other procedural or performance requirements.

C.    Findings. The housing authority development permit granting exceptions may be approved if the following findings are made:

1.    The proposal complies with the purposes and directives of the Poulsbo comprehensive plan.

2.    The proposal promotes the goals of the Housing Cooperation Act, Chapter 35.83 RCW.

3.    The site is physically suitable for the type and intensity of the land use being proposed with the exception of development requirements requested.

4.    There are adequate provisions for water, sanitary sewer, and other public facilities and services to assure that the proposal will not be detrimental to public health, safety and welfare.

5.    There are adequate provisions for public access to serve the subject proposal.

6.    There will not be significant harmful effects upon environmental quality and natural resources.

7.    The negative impacts of the proposal are mitigated or otherwise balanced by the beneficial aspects of such housing through addition to the city’s housing stock or other goals established by the city’s comprehensive plan.

8.    The proposed location, size and design of the proposal will not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety or welfare of the city, or the city finds that any detrimental impacts are outweighed by the positive public benefits which such a proposal will provide to the city of Poulsbo and the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan.

18.310.060 Exceptions documented.

When an exception is allowed pursuant to this chapter, the planning director shall document in writing the allowed exception.

19.20.030    Permits not listed.

19.20.040    Consolidation of permits and appeals.


19.20.010 Permit application type.

Land use and development decisions are divided into five processes based on the type of application, who makes the decision, the amount of discretion exercised by the decision maker, the level of impact associated with the decision, the amount and type of public input sought, and the type of appeal opportunity.

A.    A Type I application permit process is an administrative review and decision by the appropriate department head or designee. These are applications which are generally categorically exempt from review under State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) or permits for which environmental review has been completed in connection with another application, and which have limited or no public interest. A Type I application is subject to clear, objective and nondiscretionary standards or standards that require the exercise of professional judgment about technical issues.

B.    A Type II application permit process is an administrative review and decision by the appropriate department head or designee. A Type II application is subject to objective and subjective standards that require the exercise of limited discretion about nontechnical issues and about which there may be a limited public interest. Public notification is provided at the application and decision stages of review. Environmental review is conducted, when required.

C.    A Type III application permit process is a quasi-judicial review and decision made by the hearing examiner or, in the case of master plans, by the city council. A Type III application is subject to standards that may require the exercise of substantial discretion and about which there may be a broad public interest. Environmental review is conducted, when required. The appropriate review authority holds an open record public hearing after receiving a recommendation from the planning commission. Depending on the application, a neighborhood meeting may be required to obtain public input. Public notification is provided at the application, public hearing and decision stages of application review. The appropriate review authority makes a decision after considering the recommendation of the planning commission, the public testimony received at the open public hearing, and project file record.

D.    A Type IV application permit process is a legislative land use decision made by the city council under its authority to establish policies and regulations regarding future development and management of land. A Type IV application is the creation or amendment of land use policy or law by ordinance, or the land use designation and zoning of property on a map. Environmental review is conducted when required. The planning commission holds a public hearing and makes a recommendation to the city council. The city council holds a public hearing and makes the final decision.

E.    A Type V application permit process is a legislative land use decision made by the city council involving legislatively enacted, approved and valid concomitant agreements governing a specific property when it is in the best interest of the property owner and the city to release or modify the property from the conditions imposed by the concomitant agreement. The city council holds a public hearing and makes the final decision. (Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)

Note: An exempt status in Table 19.20.020 indicates exemption from the procedural requirements of this title, and does not indicate exemption from other city required permits.

(Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


19.20.030 Permits not listed.

If a permit or land use action is not listed in Table 19.20.020, the planning director shall make a determination as to the appropriate review procedure based on the most analogous permit or land use action listed. (Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


19.20.040 Consolidation of permits and appeals.

A.    Where more than one land use permit for a given development is required, all permit applications (except Type I applications) may be submitted for review collectively according to the consolidated review process established by this section.

B.    Where two or more land use applications for a given development are submitted for consolidated review, the review shall be conducted using the highest numbered process type applicable to any of the land use applications; provided, that each land use application shall only be subject to the relevant decision criteria applicable to that particular development application. For example, a development proposal that includes a Type II application and a Type III application shall be reviewed using the Type III process, but the Type II application shall be decided based on the relevant decision criteria applicable to the Type II application.

C.    When the consolidated process established by this section is used, the city shall issue single, consolidated notices, staff reports, and decision documents encompassing all of the land use applications under review. Except as provided in subsection E of this section, the applications shall be considered in a single, consolidated open record public hearing when applicable, and shall be subject to no more than one consolidated closed record appeal.

D.    Where a development requires more than one land use permit but the applicant elects not to submit all applications for consolidated review, applications may be submitted and processed sequentially; provided, that the permit subject to the highest numbered process type must be submitted and obtained first, followed by the other permits in sequence from the highest numbered type to the lowest.

E.    Where a development proposal requires a comprehensive plan and/or zoning map amendment, the map amendments must be considered and approved by the city council before any hearing is held or decision is made on any relevant application for conditional use permit, subdivision, planned residential development, variance, master planned development, site plan, or other similar quasi-judicial or administrative action. This subsection is intended to be a “procedural requirement” applicable to such actions as contemplated by RCW 58.71.070.

F.    All appeals of project permit decisions for single project shall be consolidated and heard together in a single appeal, except for appeals of SEPA determinations of significance. Where a determination of significance (DS) is appealed, the appeal shall be heard by the hearing examiner prior to any consideration of the underlying application. Where a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) or the adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) is appealed, the hearing on the appeal shall be consolidated with any open record public hearing to be conducted on the underlying application. (Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


Chapter 19.30 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

Sections:

19.30.010    Preapplication review.

19.30.020    Counter complete review.

19.30.030    Technically complete review.


19.30.010 Preapplication review.

A.    The purpose of preapplication review is:

1.    To acquaint city and other agency staff with a sufficient level of detail about the proposed development, in order for staff to advise applicants on the requirements of the Poulsbo Municipal Code and other applicable requirements, law and information from the city and other agencies.

2.    To reduce or eliminate the city’s need to request additional information or corrections that causes revisions or resubmittals.

3.    Reduce time frames for approval of land use applications by providing the applicant detailed input and applicable requirements in order for the applicant to submit a complete and code-compliant land use application.

B.    Preapplication review is required for Type II and III permits, and Type IV and V permit applications that are not filed by the city.

C.    Preapplication review may be waived by the planning director only for Type II permit applications, when: (1) a completed preapplication form and any requested information has been submitted by applicant; and (2) the planning director, in consultation with other development review departments, determines that the proposal is ready for counter complete review and includes all necessary documents.

1.    In general, a waiver of a preapplication conference may be granted when it is either: (a) determined the proposal is relatively simple (i.e., has few development-related issues); (b) involves subsequent phases of an approved development where requirements are known; (c) an application is substantially similar to a prior proposal affecting substantially the same property; or (d) is an application for post-decision modification(s).

2.    In requesting a waiver, the applicant shall complete a waiver request form as provided by the planning department and submit it with the preapplication package submittal, explain why the application warrants waiving of preapplication review, and acknowledge that waiving the preapplication review increases the risk the application processing will be delayed. The preapplication package shall contain all the documents necessary for counter complete review (Section 19.30.020).

D. To initiate preapplication review, an applicant shall submit a completed preapplication form with the requested information to the city and required fee. Information not provided on the form shall be provided on the face of a supporting map, drawing, documents or attachments. The information included in the submitted materials shall be of sufficient detail in order for the city to adequately review the proposed project and provide feedback.

E.    Within fourteen calendar days after receipt of an application for preapplication review, the planning department shall schedule a preapplication conference and provide in writing to the applicant, city development review staff and other appropriate agencies, a notice of the conference with date, time and location.

F.    The planning department shall coordinate the involvement of department and agency staff responsible for development review in the preapplication review process.

G.    Preapplication conferences are not public meetings, and are not typically open to the public. The planning director may limit attendance at such meetings.

H.    The planning director shall provide to the applicant and those who request a copy a preapplication conference summary letter within fourteen calendar days after the date of the preapplication conference. The written summary shall do the following to the extent possible given the information provided by the applicant:

1.    Summarize the proposed project.

2.    Identify the review authority, relevant approval criteria and development standards in the Poulsbo Municipal Code or other applicable codes, standards or requirements.

3.    Evaluate the submitted information the applicant offered to comply with the relevant code, standards or requirements. Identify specific additional information that is needed to respond to the relevant codes, standards or requirements, or is recommended to respond to other issues.

4.    Identify applicable application fees in effect at the time, with the disclaimer that fees may change.

5.    Identify information relevant to the application that may be in the possession of the city or other agencies of which the city is aware, such as:

a.    Comprehensive plan map designation and zoning on and in the vicinity of the project subject to the application.

b.    Physical development limitations, such as steep or unstable slopes, wetlands, water bodies, shorelines and others that may exist on and in the vicinity of the project subject to the application.

c.    Those public facilities that will serve the property subject to the application, including water, sewer, roads, storm drainage, parks and schools, fire and relevant considerations, such as minimum access and fire flow requirements, and impact fees.

d.    Other applications that have been approved or are being considered for land in the vicinity of the property subject to the proposed application that may affect or be affected by the proposed application.

6.    Confirm the application(s) and document(s) that will be necessary for counter complete application requirements. The planning director may waive application requirements that are clearly not necessary based on the nature of the proposed application, development, site or other factors. To the extent possible, the application requirements shall be identified in the preapplication summary letter.

I.    The preapplication summary letter provided by the city shall expire six months from the date the preapplication conference is held. Upon written request by the applicant thirty days prior to the expiration setting forth reasons for the request, the planning director may extend the validity of the preapplication comments by one additional six-month period.

J.    More than one preapplication conference may be held on a proposed project, and may be required by the planning director at the conclusion of the initial preapplication conference.

1.    A second preapplication conference will be charged one-half the amount of the original preapplication conference fee.

2.    If a second preapplication is for a similar project as the initial preapplication conference, but on a different site, the full fee amount for preapplication conference will be charged.

K.    A counter complete application that the planning director finds is substantially similar to the subject of a preapplication conference must be submitted prior to the expiration set forth in subsection H of this section.

L.    Once the preapplication comments have expired, the applicant must file a new request for a preapplication conference or receive approval of a preapplication waiver (if applicable) in order to submit a development application. (Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


19.30.020 Counter complete review.

A.    Before accepting a Type II or III application, or applicant-initiated Type IV or V application, a determination that the application is counter complete shall be made. Counter complete review shall be made at a permit intake appointment with a planning department official.

B.    An application is counter complete if the permit application purports and appears to include the information identified in the preapplication conference summary letter, and the appropriate application(s) fee is included.

C.    No effort shall be made to evaluate the substantive adequacy of the information in the application at the counter complete review process.

D.    If the permit application is accepted as counter complete, the city shall initiate review for technically complete status.

E.    If the permit application is not accepted as counter complete, it shall immediately be rejected, and identify what is needed to make the application counter complete. The missing components will be identified at the appointment and followed up in writing by the city. (Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)


19.30.030 Technically complete review.

A.    Determination. Within twenty-eight calendar days after receiving a counter complete Type II or III application or applicant-initiated Type IV and V application, the planning director shall provide a written determination to the applicant stating either: (1) that the application is technically complete; or (2) that the application is not technically complete and what is necessary to make the application complete, as set forth in subsection C of this section.

1.    A preliminary substantive review of the submitted application materials will be made by the city at this time to determine whether an application is technically complete. The preliminary substantive review will include, at a minimum, a review of the submitted application, drawing(s), studies and other materials, to the requirements and comments identified in the preapplication conference summary letter and applicable provisions of the PMC.

2.    If a determination of technical completeness or determination of incompleteness is not issued within twenty-eight calendar days, the application shall be deemed complete at the end of the twenty-eighth day.

3.    The determination of technical completeness shall not preclude the planning director from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of determination of technical completeness or subsequently, if new information is required to complete review of the application or substantial changes in the permit application are proposed.

B.    Application Content. An application is technically complete if it includes the following:

1.    A completed application form signed and notarized by the owner(s) of the property or by a representative authorized to do so.

2.    All required information listed on the application form, and all information required per the relevant sections of the Poulsbo Municipal Code and/or identified as necessary in the preapplication review summary letter is included in the submitted drawings, required engineering documents, environmental documents and/or other materials.

a.    The planning director may waive application requirements that are clearly not necessary with regard to a specific project and may modify application requirements based on the nature of the proposed application, development, site or other factors. To the extent possible, the application requirements shall be identified in the preapplication summary letter.

3.    A copy of the preapplication review summary letter, or a preapplication waiver if one was approved.

4.    If required, a neighborhood meeting has been held, and a copy of the attendance and received comments summary.

5.    A current Kitsap County assessor map(s) showing the subject property(ies) within a radius of three hundred feet (including full parcels if partially within the three-hundred-foot radius); a list of the names and addresses of owners of all properties within that radius; and three sets of mailing labels with the names and addresses of owners of all properties within that radius.

C.    Incomplete Application. If the planning director decides an application is not technically complete within the time allowed in subsection A of this section, the planning director shall send the applicant a written statement indicating that the application is incomplete based on a lack of information, incomplete information or incorrect information, and listing what information or revisions are required to make the application technically complete.

1.    An applicant shall have no more than a total of ninety calendar days to submit the identified information. If at the end of a total ninety calendar days, the identified information has not been submitted to the satisfaction of the planning director, the application shall be closed, deemed null and void and no more than ninety percent of the application fees returned to the applicant.

2.    When the required information for an incomplete application is received by the city, the planning director shall notify the applicant within eighteen calendar days of receipt of the information of whether the application is now technically complete or what additional information remains needed.

D.    Upon determining an application is technically complete, a notice of application shall be issued and distributed as set forth in Section 19.50.020. (Ord. 2016-05 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2016)

4.    Applications received after the due date will be added to the comprehensive plan docket for the following year’s amendments.

5.    As applications for comprehensive plan amendments are received throughout the year, the planning director shall compile and maintain a list of all such proposed amendments. After the November 15th filing deadline and any necessary preapplication conferences are held, the planning director shall present the list to the city council for consideration. The city council shall review the list at a public meeting and shall determine, which, if any, of the proposed amendments shall be processed further.

a.    When selected by the city council for further processing, a comprehensive plan amendment shall be processed as provided for Type IV application permits.

b.    When not selected by the city council for further processing, the proposed amendment shall be removed from the docket, and any amendment fee submitted (not including any preapplication fees) shall be refunded. Resubmittal of an application removed from the docket may be made at the next annual review cycle.

6.    Proposed comprehensive plan amendments that are denied after the completion of the Type IV permit application process may not be resubmitted to the docket for a period of two annual review cycles.

C.    Amendments to Development Regulations. Amendments to the city’s development regulations shall be processed as a Type IV permit application and may be initiated at any time, unless a comprehensive plan amendment is necessary.

D.    Public Participation Program for All Type IV Applications. This subsection is intended to meet the requirements of RCW 36.70A.140 that a public participation program be established and broadly disseminated identifying procedures providing for early and continuous public participation in the development and amendment of comprehensive land use plans and development regulations implementing such plans.

1.    Purpose. In order to provide for early and continuous public participation, the following public participation goals have been established for Type IV permit applications:

a.    Provide the public with timely information, an understanding of the process, and opportunities to review and comment on Type IV permit applications, and have these comments forwarded to the city planning commission and city council.

b.    Ensure that information about the application is provided to the public early in the process and at regular intervals thereafter, to maximize public awareness and participation.

c.    Incorporate public comment into the city’s review process prior to significant procedural milestones or decision making.

d.    Consult and consider recommendations from neighboring jurisdictions, federal and state agencies, and Native American tribes.

2.    Public Participation Plan. A public participation plan will be developed for each Type IV permit and will be broadly disseminated by posting it on the city’s website and a summary of the public participation plan will be included in the amendment application’s notice of application. The notice of application shall be issued and distributed as set forth in Section 19.50.020.

3.    Information Availability. The city shall undergo the following procedures to make information available to the public for Type IV permit applications:

a.    All documents related to a Type IV permit application will be available for public review. Hard copy of all documents will be available for review at Poulsbo City Hall. Copies will be provided at a reasonable cost.

b.    The primary clearinghouse for information related to Type IV permit applications is the city website, www.cityofpoulsbo.com, where the proposed Type IV applications, meeting dates, updates on process, notice of application, environmental review, notice of public hearing, staff reports, findings of fact, and notice of decision will be posted. An email link for questions or comments will be provided at the website.

2.    For purposes of calculating timelines and counting days of permit processing, the applicable time period shall begin on the first working day following the date the application is determined to be technically complete pursuant to Section 19.30.030, and shall only include the time during which the city can proceed with review of the application, as set forth in Section 19.80.040.

A.    Any period during which the applicant has been requested by the city to correct or revise drawings or designs, perform required studies, or provide additional required information. The period shall be calculated from the date the city notifies the applicant in writing for the need for corrections, revisions and/or additional information, until the date the city determines whether the corrections, revisions and/or additional information satisfies the request for information. The city shall notify the applicant within fourteen calendar days after the date the information has been provided to the city, or it shall be presumed satisfactory.

B.    If the city determines that the information submitted by the applicant is insufficient, it shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies, and the procedures under subsection A of this section shall apply as if a new request for information had been made.

C.    Any period during which an environmental impact statement is being prepared following a determination of significance pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW, or if the city and the applicant in writing agree to a time period for completion of an environmental impact statement.

1.    The applicant requests such an extension in writing no less than thirty days prior to the permit becoming null and void. Verbal requests will not be accepted.

2.    The planning director finds that good cause has prevented them from providing the additional information within the ninety-calendar-day time period. Disagreement with required city codes and/or standards does not qualify as “good cause.”

3.    The applicant demonstrates the likelihood that the requested information will be provided to the city within the additional ninety-calendar-day time period.

4.    No more than one extension shall be granted.

5.    If at the end of the ninety-day extension the requested revisions, corrections, studies or information has not been submitted and accepted by the city, the application will be formally closed and a new application and fees will be required to be submitted.
