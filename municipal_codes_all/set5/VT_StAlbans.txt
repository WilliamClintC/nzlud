Subchapter 17. Transient or Itinerant Photographers
SECTION
1561. Purposes
(a) It is hereby declared that the regulation of itinerant photographers is
essential to the public safety, morals and welfare of the inhabitants of this
city to the end that certain abuses heretofore practiced shall be curbed.
Some of the practices sought to be regulated are as follows: The practice
of itinerant photographers, going from house to house in the city collecting
monies without giving proper receipts therefor, delaying delivery of
pictures for an unreasonable time beyond the promised date, defalcating
orders of which no duplicate is left with the customer, nor leaving their
names and addresses with the customer or of supplying the customer with
false names and addresses, the fraudulent misrepresentation that pictures
are being taken for some press service that does not exist, the taking of
pictures, delivering them and receiving pay, which pictures within a few
months thereafter fade when in many cases the customer does not even
know the name and address of the photographer, the practice of
irresponsible itinerant photographers of taking obscene photographs or
portrait. Many of these practices and others, including the charging of
unconscionable prices, have been shown to have been practiced upon
minors.
(c) This subchapter is also enacted as a revenue measure.

equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
(a) Reject the wastes,
(b) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers,
(c) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge,
and/or,
(d) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer
charges.
g. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design, plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to
proposed equipment and facilities; shall be submitted for the approval of the
Superintendent and the DEC and no construction of such facilities shall be

a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer
to facilitate observation sampling, and measurement of the wastes.
Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by
him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. All industries discharging into a
public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their discharges as the
Superintendent may reasonably require, including installation, use and
maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting the results
of such monitoring to the Superintendent. Such records shall be made available
upon request by the Superintendent to other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharging to the receiving waters. When industrial pretreatment permits are
issued by the State of Vermont, monitoring records must also be submitted to the
Secretary in accordance with such permit. Records of any monitoring will be
supplied by the Superintendent to the Secretary on request.
9 - 40
m. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to
which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with
the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at
said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest manhole in the public sewer
to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried
out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.
The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or
samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.
n. That any industry held in violation of the provisions of this ORDINANCE may
have its disposal authorization terminated.
o. No statement contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between City and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste or unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City for
treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern. Provided that
such agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing Federal Laws and
are compatible with any user charge and industrial cost recovery system in effect.

This ordinance is enacted to protect, preserve and promote the health, safety, welfare,

and reduce unnecessary noises which are physically harmful or otherwise detrimental to the
enjoyment of life, property and maintenance of business.

“Noise” is any sound, which annoys or disturbs the peace and/or ability to repose of a
human due to its frequency or amplitude.
“Plainly audible” means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her unaided
hearing faculties. As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a portable or
personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the enforcement officer need not
determine the title of a song, specific words, or the artist performing the song. The detection of
the rhythmic base component of the music is sufficient to constitute a plainly audible sound.
“Sound” is vibrations that are detected by the “average” unaided human ear.

time with louder volume than is necessary for convenient hearing for the person or
persons who are in the room, vehicle, or chamber in which such a machine or device is
operated and who are voluntary listeners thereto.
D. Exhaust. The discharge into the open air of the exhaust of any steam engine, internal

of this ordinance.

Section 11. Allocation Principles
Recognizing that the capacity of the wastewater treatment facility is a limited resource in high
demand, and that uncontrolled assignment of capacity could cause an adverse impact on the
City’s tax base, economic competitiveness, and ability to provide municipal services, the City
shall strictly allocate the uncommitted reserve capacity pursuant to the policies, procedures,
principles and criteria outlined in this Ordinance.
Section 12: Application Requirements
1. A developer or property owner seeking an allocation for water and/or wastewater
service must complete an application on a form to be furnished by the City. All

uncommitted reserve capacity to accommodate the volume and strength of
the proposed connection?
c. If the proposed wastewater is not of sanitary sewage origin, has sufficient
evidence been presented by the applicant to demonstrate that the flow and
character of the wastewater is compatible with the proper operation of the
plant and sewers and the proposed wastewater will not alone or in

Section 15: Preliminary Approval Minimum Conditions
After making the approval findings above, a preliminary connection approval may be issued.
Preliminary connection approval shall constitute a binding commitment of capacity to the project,
contingent on compliance with all conditions attached to the preliminary approval and
subsequent issuance of a final connection approval. The preliminary approval conditions at a
minimum shall include:
1. Three years for the preliminary approval to remain valid unless extended by the Manager
/ Board, depending on who issued the approval.
2. Incorporation of specific conditions which must be fulfilled by the applicant to
maintain validity of the preliminary connection approval.
3. Provision for revocation by the action of the BOARD on failure of the applicant to
fulfill requirements of the preliminary connection approval.
4. Specifications that the recipient of the preliminary connection approval may not
22 - 10
transfer, by any means, the preliminary connection approval to any other person, or
project.
Section 16: Extensions of the Service Area
The proposed users to be served by the expansion and/or the developer shall pay the entire cost
of the extension which shall be constructed in accordance with City specifications. Once the
infrastructure is constructed, inspected, and certified by a Vermont professional engineer, it
shall be deeded over to the City.
Section 17: Final Connection Pre-requisites
Prior to consideration of final connection approval, the following commitments shall be met
by the applicant:
1. Applicable local, state and federal permits must be secured for the
development/project.
2. Allocation fees, connection fees, permit fees, and other local fees or taxes, must be paid
in full to the City of St. Albans.
3. The plans and specifications for connection to and, if necessary, extension of the City’s
water and wastewater infrastructure are accepted by the Manager.
Section 18: Final Connection Approval
Upon making affirmative findings that all conditions of the preliminary connection approval
and final connection pre-requisites have been fulfilled, the Manager shall issue the final
connection approval permit, which may be conditioned as follows:
1. The permit shall specify the allowed volume, flow rate, strength, and any other
characteristics of the proposed discharge determined appropriate.
2. The construction of the connection and, if necessary, the extension, must be overseen
by Vermont Professional Engineer to ensure compliance with the plans and
specifications and good construction practice in a manner acceptable to the Manager.
3. The Vermont Professional Engineer must provide the City a written certification that
the project was constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
4. Any capacity allocated in conjunction with the final connection approval for building
development shall revert to the City of St. Albans if the permit recipient has failed to
initiate construction within one year of the issued date on the permit.
5. The date on which the Permit shall expire shall be determined by the Board, based on
the original development plan and any other governmental permits and approvals
affecting the project/development, as well as any other factors deemed appropriate by
22 - 11
the BOARD. Upon expiration of the Permit, the unused portion of the committed
capacity allocation will revert to the City of St. Albans and there will be no refund of
any paid fees. Generally, the unused capacity reverting to the City of St. Albans is
associated with buildings that do not at least have foundations, framing, and roofs.
6. Regardless of the permit expiration period above, the Board may order construction of
the development over a longer period if this action is in the best interest of the City of St.
Albans.
7. For subdivision projects the permit holder of a proposed subdivided parcel must indicate
the development planned for each lot. If all prerequisites defined for final connection
approval herein are met, final connection permits will be issued to the subdivision owner
for each lot with a specific reserve capacity allocation associated with the proposed
development.
a. The subdivision owner shall file the final connection permits in the land records
of the municipality the property is located in along with the copies of all fees
paid and reference to the location of the approved connection plans and
specifications. When the owner/developer of a subdivision sells individual lots
within the time frame, the final connection permit shall transfer when the
property is transferred and the new owner becomes bound to comply with all
permits issued, as well as the plans and specifications for connecting to the City
infrastructure. The transferred permit will be considered a new permit issued on
the date of property transfer and the constraints of subsection (e) above will
apply to this permit. The permit will expire as provided in subsection (e) above.
8. In cases where a final connection permit expires and a new owner applies for capacity on
the same or different project, the Board may consider fees paid by the original owner
when setting fees for the new owner applying for capacity.
9. The designated City of St. Albans official shall be notified one week in advance of any
proposed sewer connection authorized by a final connection permit. The connection to
the City of St. Albans sewer shall not be performed until approved by the official.
Additional constraints may be found in other articles of this ordinance.
10. No final connection shall be permitted until the developer or other record owner conveys
to the City of St. Albans by easement deed in a form satisfactory to the City:
a. A perpetual right and permanent easement to lay, repair, maintain and operate
sewer pipes and associated equipment over, under, and upon the specified lands
and premises;
b. A perpetual right and permanent easement, from time to time, to renew, replace,
modify, and otherwise change said sewer lines, manholes, and associated
equipment, and to pass over specified lands for all said purposes;
c. Title in fee to all sewer lines or pipes, manholes, and associated equipment, as
may be depicted on the plat for the project/development. In said easement deed,
the City of St. Albans will agree that upon completion of construction, said sewer
22 - 12
lines, manholes, and associated equipment, and after each subsequent entry, it
will restore the surface of the lands and premises to the condition of such lands
and premises prior to entry.
Section 19: Allocation Transfer
1. Initially, reserve capacity is allocated to a specified owner, project, and parcel of land.
The allocation is made solely to a parcel of land and therefore does not run with the land
until project completion. After completion of the project, the allocation will run with the
land.
2. Requests to transfer an allocation may be considered following the same process for
granting a new allocation so long as the allocation has not expired or violated any
conditions.
Section 20. Moratorium and Severability
Upon implementation of this ordinance, the moratorium on water and wastewater allocations
outside the legal limits of the City, adopted May 2, 2011, shall be repealed. However, if a court
of competent jurisdiction invalidates the affiliation fee components of this ordinance, such
finding shall not invalidate the remaining parts of this ordinance but shall automatically reinstate
the moratorium on water and wastewater allocations outside the City limits, adopted May 2,
2011.
Section 21. Effective Date.
This ordinance shall become effective November 15, 2015.

Chapter 1. General
Sec. 1.1 Findings.
The St. Albans City Council finds and declares that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in the amount of impervious cover
within a watershed often alter the hydrologic response and water quality aspects of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
sediment transport and deposition and the concentration of waterborne pollutants and pathogens.
B. Clearing and grading during construction tend to increase soil erosion and reduce the
native vegetation important for terrestrial habitat, for stream regulation through shading and for
maintenance of natural food cycles important to food chains and aquatic habitat. Effective
erosion controls are important techniques in preventing water pollution, soil loss, wildlife habitat
loss and human property loss. Clearing and grading is particularly disruptive within stream
corridors, contributing to streambank erosion, loss of vegetative cover, overland transport of
pollutants into the stream, and loss of riparian habitat.
C. Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase
downstream flooding and increase the velocity of stormwater runoff causing stream bank erosion
and buildup of sedimentation.
D. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing
groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
E. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution can be controlled,
minimized and in some cases eliminated through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land
development activities. Illicit discharges must be eliminated.
F. The regulation of stormwater discharges from new development and redevelopment of
existing sites, the elimination of illicit discharges, and the control of erosion, sediment and
stormwater discharge is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and
safety posed by unmanaged runoff.
G. The creation of a stormwater utility, enterprise fund, and a system of fees is necessary to
ensure the public health and safety in the management of stormwater pollution and operation of
the stormwater system in the City of St. Albans.
Sec. 1.2 Purpose.
This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the City of St. Albans Charter§§ 16-22, 10 V.S.A. Chapter
47, 24 V.S.A. Chapters 97 and 101, and 24 V.S.A. §2291(14). This Ordinance defines the rules
and regulations for the control of stormwater and operation of the stormwater utility, also
referred to as the stormwater system and/or stormwater program, of the City of St. Albans, allow
the City to exercise general regulation over the planning, location, construction, and operation
Title 25 – page 4
and maintenance of stormwater facilities in the City, whether or not owned and operated by the
City, to adopt any regulations deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Ordinance,
including the adoption of an enterprise fund and system of fees for services and permits, and to
define what constitutes a public nuisance relating to illicit discharges, soil erosion, water
pollution, and stormwater management related to land disturbance activities. This Ordinance also
provides procedures for the abatement or removal of such public nuisances as the public health,
safety or welfare may require. This Ordinance also establishes methods for controlling the
discharge of sediment, stormwater and non-stormwater discharges into the MS4, and/or surface
or ground water in order to comply with the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process, and General Permit No. 3-9014 as issued by the
State of Vermont.
Sec. 1.3 Applicability.
This Ordinance shall apply to all property within the City of St. Albans and shall apply
specifically as indicated in Chapters within this Ordinance.
Sec. 1.4 Severability.
The provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause,
sentence, or paragraph of this Ordinance or the application thereof to any person, establishment,
or circumstances shall be held invalid, it shall not affect the validity or application of other
provisions of this Ordinance.
Sec. 1.5 Relation to other Ordinances of the City of St. Albans.
If the provisions of these regulations conflict with the provisions of any other valid and
enforceable City of St. Albans Ordinance(s), the stricter shall prevail.
Sec. 1.6 Ultimate Responsibility.
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this Ordinance are minimum
standards; therefore, this Ordinance does not intend nor imply that compliance by any Person
will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge or
discharge of pollutants.

Title 25 – page 18
minimum stormwater management requirements for post-construction sites in the City of St.
Albans, in order to comply with the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process, and General Permit No. 3-9014 as issued by the
State of Vermont. The specific purposes of this Chapter are:
A. To minimize increases in stormwater runoff from Development in order to reduce
flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and stream bank erosion;
B. To maintain the integrity of stream channels and minimize disruption to natural
hydrologic processes from land development;
C. To minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
Development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
D. To reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and non-point source
pollution through the effective use of landscaping, surfacing, and stormwater treatment practices,
and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained;
E. To establish the legal authority to carry out all review, inspection and enforcement
procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Chapter.
Sec. 6.2 Applicability of Post-Construction Stormwater Management Requirements.
This Chapter applies to Development activities that result in the creation, expansion or
redevelopment of impervious surface, as such terms are defined in this Ordinance and as
enumerated in Section 6.4, unless otherwise exempted under Section 6.5. All projects
undertaken by the City of St. Albans shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
Sec. 6.3 Prohibitions.
No person required to obtain a permit from the City for any Development that results in the
creation, expansion or redevelopment of impervious surface shall improperly manage stormwater
runoff associated with these activities, and/or fail to conform to the requirements of this Chapter.
Sec. 6.4 Permits.
No person shall be granted an approval by the City of St. Albans for any Development regulated
under this Chapter without compliance with the following provisions:
A. Projects that result in the creation of new impervious surface greater than one acre or the
expansion of existing impervious surface of greater than one acre shall require evidence of
application to the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation for coverage under
General Permit 3-9015 for Stormwater Discharges or an Individual Stormwater Discharge
Permit, as applicable.
Title 25 – page 19
B. Projects resulting in one acre or more of land disturbance, whether as an individual
project or under a Common Plan of Development, and that do not otherwise require coverage
under General Permit 3-9015 for Stormwater Discharges or a Vermont Individual Stormwater
Discharge Permit shall require approval by the Administrative Officer or his/her designee of a
Stormwater Management Plan equivalent to the requirements of General Permit 3-9015 for
Stormwater Discharges as enumerated in the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual, as most
recently revised.
Sec. 6.5 Exemptions.
The following activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this Chapter:
A. Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property
or natural resources.
B. Any active nursery or garden harvested for personal use of products and that, in the
opinion of the Administrative Officer, does not have the potential to cause significant
erosion or stormwater management impacts, or endanger property or public safety, if
post-construction stormwater is not properly mitigated and controlled.
C. Construction or modification of single-family or two-family dwellings and accessory
structures and appurtenances thereto, where no impervious surface or structure is
proposed to be sited within 30 linear feet of the centerline of Grice Brook, Rugg Brook or

public health, safety or welfare, the Administrative Officer or his/her designee may issue a Stop
Work Order and/or suspend or revoke the permit.
Chapter 10. Stormwater System User Fees.
Sec. 10.1 Establishment of Stormwater User Fees.
A. A user fee based on an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) shall be imposed on all properties
or parcels as otherwise defined in Section 10.1(D). An ERU shall equal that square footage
that approximately represents the average of the area of impervious surface for all single
family and two-family properties with total impervious surface less than 10,000 square feet
in the City. The City Council shall, by resolution, establish the square footage that
constitutes one ERU on a periodic basis.
B. The City Council shall have the authority to set and modify the user fee rates so that the
total revenue generated by said charges, and any secondary sources of revenue, shall be
sufficient to fund the City’s stormwater program.
C. The City Council shall establish by resolution the annual rate for each ERU. The annual user
fee for a specific property or parcel is determined by multiplying the rate per ERU times the
number of ERUs allocated to the property or parcel.
Title 25 – page 24
D. Owners of all parcels, including tax-exempt parcels, that are assigned an ERU value under
Section 10.3 will be charged a stormwater fee. Owners of condominiums will be assigned
an ERU and be charged a stormwater fee, unless their ownership association receives a St.
Albans water and sewer bill for the combined property as of the adoption of this Ordinance,
in which case the association will be charged the fee for the combined property’s assigned
ERU. The ERUs and stormwater fee for mobile home parks shall be assigned to the mobile
home park owner. The Administrative Officer may waive charging a stormwater fee to any
property whereby the owner cannot be easily determined and that the efforts to do so create
an unreasonable and disproportionate burden to the utility and its rate payers in relationship
to the overall public benefit.
E. From time to time, the City Council may order that the impervious surface square footage
basis for a portion or all of the City be updated using the most recent appropriate geographic
information systems data. During this update, the Administrative Officer is allowed, but not
required, to use other permitting, assessing or on-site measurement data to supplement the
process.
Sec. 10.2 User Fee Credits.
A. The Stormwater Utility Credit Manual shall specify the design and performance standards of
on-site stormwater systems, activities and services which qualify for application of a user
fee credit and the method of calculating credits. Under no circumstances shall a credit be
applied to the stormwater bill for parcels having only 1 ERU, or to condominium properties
for which the total combined impervious equals only 1 ERU. The City Council, by
resolution, shall have the authority to approve, modify or disapprove the Credit Manual.
B. Any property or parcel owner may appeal the determination regarding an award of a credit.
The appeal process is outlined under Chapter 11 of this Ordinance.
C. Credits may be awarded retroactively for one (1) year from the date of initiation of the
stormwater user fee. Thereafter, credits shall be applied to user fees on the next billing
period after the completed credit application is approved.
D. Any award of credit shall be conditioned on continuing compliance with the City’s design
and performance standards as stated in the Stormwater Utility Credit Manual and/or upon
continuing provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated,
and maintained by the property or parcel owner or owners upon which the credit is based.
The Administrative Officer may revoke a credit at any time for non-compliance by
providing thirty (30) days written notice of a non-complying condition and intent to revoke
the credit to the property or parcel owner. If the non-compliance is not cured within the
thirty (30) day period, the Administrative Officer shall eliminate the credit for user fee bills
issued to the property or parcel owner after such period.
Title 25 – page 25
Sec. 10.3 Assignment of ERUs
A. Single Family and two-family properties or parcels with less than 6,000 square feet of
impervious shall be billed one (1.0) ERU, as defined in Section 10.1.
B. All properties or parcels with no impervious surface shall be billed one (1.0) ERU, as
defined in Section 10.1.
C. Owners of condominiums will be assigned an ERU rounded to the nearest 0.5 and greater
than zero (0), unless their ownership association already receives a water/wastewater
utility bill for the combined property as of the adoption of this Ordinance, in which case
the association will be assigned an ERU rounded to the nearest whole number as defined
in Section 10.3, subsection D.
D. All properties or parcels with impervious surface that do not qualify under Section 10.3,
subsections A through C, shall be billed the ERU’s that are determined by dividing the
total impervious surface on the property or parcel by one (1.0) ERU as defined in Section
10.1. The resulting value shall be rounded to the nearest whole number and shall be
greater than zero (0). In those instances when the calculations produce a value exactly
half-way between two numbers, (.5) the number is rounded up to the next whole number.
E. Notwithstanding the other subsections of this Section, no City-owned parcel that contains
a Public Stormwater Treatment Facility and no City street rights-of-way shall be assigned
any ERUs.
F. Also, notwithstanding the other subsections of this Section, the City Manager or their
designee may enter into agreements with property owners to reduce the number of
assigned ERUs for any properties that contain to a Public Stormwater Treatment Facility.
Such agreements may also be made for property owners that make financial contributions
to Public Stormwater Treatment off-site and could include reductions in assigned ERUs
for any other related properties.
G. A property-owner may appeal their ERU assignment to the Administrative Officer. The
Administrative Officer may choose to use GIS data, permitting and assessing
information, and on-site measurements to update the impervious surface square footage
basis of the appellant’s property’s ERU. After the Administrative Officer’s analysis, the
property’s ERU may be adjusted up or down or stay the same. If changed, the new ERU
shall take effect on the next billing period after the analysis is complete. The propertyowner
may appeal the Administrative Officer’s decision pursuant to Chapter 11.
Sec. 10.4 Billing and Collection
A. Stormwater user fees shall be billed quarterly and shall be reflected on the utility bill for
each property or parcel owner.
B. The filing of an appeal pursuant to Chapter 11 of this Ordinance shall not relieve a property
Title 25 – page 26
or parcel owner of the obligation to pay the user fee when due.
C. . Stormwater user fees shall be considered delinquent thirty (30) days after the billing date.
Delinquent stormwater user fees shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per
month, or fraction thereof, for the first three months and thereafter one and one-half percent
(1.5%) per month or fraction thereof, from the due date of such stormwater user fee bill.
Such interest shall be imposed on a fraction of a month as if it were an entire month.
D. All stormwater user fees, interest, finance charges, and court costs shall be a charge and a
lien upon the property to which the stormwater user fee is assessed from the date the same
becomes due until paid in full, in the same manner and to the same effect, as taxes are a lien
upon real estate pursuant to 32 V.S.A. §5061 and 24 V.S.A. §3612.
E. When a property pays late fees, interest and finance charges for stormwater, water and
wastewater charges shown on one bill, any payments shall be applied toward the stormwater
liabilities first, before being applied to water and wastewater liabilities.
Sec. 10.5 Establishment of Stormwater Enterprise Fund
A. The user fees, as well as any secondary sources of revenue, shall be used to fund the City’s
efforts to manage stormwater in the municipality and operate the City’s system for
stormwater collection, conveyance and treatment.
B. Revenues will be placed into the Stormwater Enterprise Fund and may be retained and
expended in the manner set forth herein.
C. The St. Albans City Council shall establish a dedicated stormwater enterprise fund in the
City budget and an accounting system for the purpose of managing all funds collected for
the purposes and obligations of the stormwater program. All revenues and receipts of the
stormwater program shall be placed in the enterprise fund, which shall be separate from all
other funds. Fees will be set at a rate that covers the costs associated with stormwater
management, collection, conveyance, treatment, planning, staffing, engineering,
maintenance and repair, public education, capital improvements, technical assistance,
customer service, and other services approved by the City to implement the purposes of the
stormwater program as set forth herein. The City Council may consider both stormwater
quality and quantity management needs in determining whether to expend any funds in the
Stormwater Enterprise Fund, and the use of the fund is limited to operating expenses, nonoperating
expenses such as equipment, payment of principal and interest on debt
obligations, capital improvement projects, reserve expenses and other costs as deemed
necessary by the St. Albans City Council.
D. Excess revenues may be placed into a reserve fund and may be retained and expended
pursuant to Section 10.5.
Title 25 – page 27

PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY ORDINANCE
CITY OF ST. ALBANS, VERMONT
SECTION 1. AUTHORITY.
This Ordinance is adopted by the City Council of the City of St. Albans under authority
granted in 24A V.S.A. Ch. 11, §§ 16 and 18-22, 24 V.S.A. §§ 2291(13), (14), and (15),
24 V.S.A. § 2121, and 24 V.S.A. Chapter 59.
SECTION 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
Being that there exist in the City of St. Albans structures, buildings and parcels of land
that have become dangerous or unsafe and numerous other structures that are vacant,
abandoned, and in disrepair, the St. Albans City Council finds and declares that:
(1) Structures that become dangerous and unsafe must promptly be made safe and
secure to protect the public safety.
(2) Structures that are vacant and not properly secured are dangerous and unsafe in
that they are extremely vulnerable to being set on fire by unauthorized persons.
(3) Many structures that are vacant, whether secured or not, are a blight on their
neighborhoods, cause deterioration and instability in their neighborhoods, and
have an adverse impact upon adjacent and nearby properties.
(4) Structures that were previously used as residential units and have since become
vacant have a significant and detrimental impact on the local housing market.
(5) Structures that are vacant and not properly secured attract vagrants and criminals
and are prime locations to conduct illegal activities, including arson and drug
use.
(6) Structures that are vacant and unsecured pose serious threats to the public health
and safety and therefore are declared to be public nuisances.
(7) Immediate abatement and rehabilitation of these structures is necessary to abate
such public nuisances, prevent unsightly blight and the deterioration of
neighborhoods with the consequent adverse impact on the value of adjacent and
nearby properties, secure the public safety and to ensure and enhance the vitality
and livability of our neighborhoods.
(8) Communication between owners of dangerous and vacant buildings and the City
is essential for effective allocation of public resources and the maintenance of
public health, welfare, and safety in regard to such structures.
PHSO - 2
The purpose of this article is to establish the reasonably necessary measures to abate the
public nuisances, blight, negative housing market impact, and other harmful effects

SECTION 6. BUILDING INSPECTION
Upon receiving information that any building, structure or property, or anything attached
or connected therewith is in violation of the specifications of this Ordinance or is
otherwise in such unsafe condition that the public safety is endangered, the Building
Safety Officer shall cause the building, structure or property to be inspected. Such
inspection shall occur according to the following process:
A. Written notice of intent to conduct an inspection pursuant to this Ordinance
shall be given to the owner of the building, structure or property at least
twenty-four (24) hours prior to the inspection.
PHSO - 5
B. If the Building Safety Officer has reason to believe that an emergency
situation exists which poses an immediate danger to the health or safety of the
public, no notification shall be necessary prior to inspection.
C. If the owner of a building, structure or property fails or refuses to consent to
the inspection and, in the Building Safety Officer’s opinion, an emergency
situation does not exist that poses an immediate danger to the health or safety
of the public, the Building Safety Officer shall be authorized to obtain a
search warrant from the Vermont Superior Court for the purpose of
determining and ensuring the structural integrity of the building, the repairs
necessary to ensure its structural integrity, that it will be safe for entry by
police officers and firefighters in times of exigent circumstances or
emergency, and that the building and its contents will not present a hazard to
the public.
D. The Building Safety Officer may also view the premises from any public
space, or, with the permission of the property owner, from any nearby or
adjacent property.
E. The Building Safety Officer may retain such law enforcement officers, fire
officials, engineers, attorneys and other qualified experts as necessary to assist
with a building safety inspection and the preparation of a Building Safety
Order.
SECTION 7. SAFETY ORDER.
A. If, upon inspection, the Building Safety Officer determines that a building,
premises, structure or anything attached or connected therewith, or any
hazardous condition appears to endanger the public safety, the Building Safety
Officer shall commence an abatement action by issuing a Safety Order. The
Safety Order shall:
1. Identify the hazardous conditions that cause the premises, building,
structure or anything attached or connected thereto to be dangerous.
2. Identify the actions that must be taken by the owner to secure the
Dangerous Building or Premises and abate the hazardous conditions
identified in the order, including, where appropriate, removal of a
Dangerous Building.
3. Set a date by which the actions to secure a Dangerous Building or
Premises and abate the hazardous conditions must be completed by the
owner, which shall be not less than three (3) business days from the date
of service of the order.
PHSO - 6
4. Inform the owner of his/her right to appeal the Building Safety Order and
the right to be represented by legal counsel at the appeal hearing.
B. The Safety Order shall be served upon the owner of the Dangerous Building
or Premises in person with written receipt or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, and by first class mail. A copy of the Order shall be provided to
the City Council of the City of St. Albans.
C. If it appears to the Building Safety Officer that such structure or premises
would be especially dangerous, the officer may affix a notice of
dangerousness in a conspicuous place upon the structure’s exterior walls, or
may affix a posted notice in the ground which shall not be removed or defaced
without the officer’s authority.
D. If the owner continues such refusal or neglects to remove or make the building
or premises safe, and the Order has become final by the failure to appeal, the
Building Safety Officer shall be fully authorized to abate the nuisance, except
where removal or demolition of a building is required. The Building Safety
Officer may, as necessary, install boards or otherwise secure a dangerous
building or order that a building be vacated by any occupants and removed.
E. For removal or demolition, the Building Safety Officer, or other appropriate
City officer, may seek approval from the appropriate Court for a remedy in
equity to remove or demolish a dangerous building, or to order such steps as
may be necessary to abate any hazardous condition. The Building Safety
Officer may also seek the imposition of fines in accord with Section 9(A) of
this Ordinance.
F. The Building Safety Officer may contract with such service providers or use
such other City employees as may be necessary to ensure public safety in the
circumstances. The full cost of any work necessitated by a Safety Order shall
constitute a lien chargeable against the property owner and may be recovered
in the same manner as taxes for real estate pursuant to 32 V.S.A. Ch. 133.
SECTION 8. APPEAL OF SAFETY ORDER
A. A person aggrieved by a Safety Order may appeal such Order to the City
Council of the City of St. Albans by filing a notice of appeal within the time
frame set forth for compliance in the safety order, pursuant to Section 7(A)(3)
of this Ordinance. The notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth a
brief statement of the basis of the appeal. The notice of appeal to the City
Council shall be filed with the Office of the City Manager, St. Albans City
Hall, 100 North Main Street, St. Albans Vermont 05478
B. Within thirty (30) days of service of the notice of appeal, the City Council
shall hold a hearing on the appeal. The City Council shall issue a written
PHSO - 7
decision within fifteen (15) days of the close of the hearing. The decision
may reverse or sustain the Safety Order and may contain such additional
requirements as the City Council deems necessary and appropriate to
implement the purpose of this Ordinance.
SECTION 9. PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT
A. If the owner fails to comply with a Safety Order, the owner shall be
considered to be in violation of the Order and this Ordinance. The City shall
be authorized to take such steps as may be allowed under Section 7(D) of this
Ordinance. In addition, any violation shall be a civil matter which may be
enforced in the Vermont Judicial Bureau or in the Franklin County Superior
Court, at the election of the Building Safety Officer.
B. A civil penalty of not more than $100.00 per violation may be imposed for
violation of this Ordinance. Each day that the violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation of this Ordinance.
C. Violations enforced in the Judicial Bureau shall be in accordance with the
provisions of 24 V.S.A. §§ 1974a and 1977 et seq. For purposes of
enforcement in the Judicial Bureau, the Building Safety Officer shall be the
designated enforcement officer. The Building Safety Officer shall issue
tickets and may be the appearing officer at any hearing.
D. Violations enforced in the Superior Court shall be in accordance with 24
V.S.A. §1974a and the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. The City of St.
Albans may pursue any and all remedies available at law or in equity.
SECTION 10. VACANT BUILDING PERMIT AND STANDARDS
A. Application by the owner of a vacant building or structure for a vacant
building permit shall be made on a form provided by the Building Safety
Officer. Applicants shall disclose all measures to be taken to ensure that the
building will be kept weather-tight and secure from trespassers, safe for entry
by police officers and firefighters in times of exigent circumstances or
emergency, and together with its premises be free from nuisance and in good
order in conformance with the vacant building maintenance standards.
B. The application shall include a "statement of intent." The statement of intent
shall include but not necessarily be limited to information as to the expected
period of vacancy (including the date of vacancy), the plan for regular
maintenance during the vacancy to comply with the maintenance safety
requirements of this subsection, and a plan and timeline for the lawful
occupancy, rehabilitation or removal or demolition of the structure.
PHSO - 8
C. Upon and at the time of application, the owner of a vacant building or
structure shall arrange for an inspection of the premises by the Building Safety
Officer and the appropriate police and fire officials. The purpose of such
inspection is to determine and ensure the structural integrity of the building,
the repairs necessary to ensure its structural integrity, that it will be safe for
entry by police officers and firefighters in times of exigent circumstances or
emergency, that the building and its contents do not present a hazard to the
public during the time that the building remains vacant, and that the building
or structure is in compliance with the standards of this Ordinance.
D. If the Building Safety Officer has reason to believe that an emergency
situation exists tending to create an immediate danger to the health, safety or
welfare of the general public, no notification or warrant shall be necessary and
the Building Safety Officer shall enter and inspect the premises pursuant to
Section 7 of this Ordinance.
E. The Building Safety Officer shall provide the St. Albans Police Department
with copies of vacant building permits at the time of issuance.
F. If the owner of the vacant building or structure fails or refuses to consent to an
inspection, the Building Safety Officer may seek a search warrant from the
Vermont Superior Court for the purpose of determining and ensuring the
structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to ensure its structural
integrity, that it will be safe for entry by police officers and firefighters in
times of exigent circumstances or emergency, that the building and its
contents do not present a hazard to the public during the time that the building
remains vacant, and that the building and structure is in compliance with the
standards of this Ordinance.
G. The Building Safety Officer, upon inspection, shall issue any order for work
needed to:
1. Adequately protect the building from intrusion by trespassers and from
deterioration by the weather in accordance with the standards set forth in
this Ordinance.
2. Ensure that allowing the building to remain will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety and welfare, will not unreasonably interfere with the
reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises within the
neighborhood, and will not pose an extraordinary hazard to police officers
or firefighters entering the premises in times of emergency.
3. When issuing such orders, the Building Safety Officer shall specify the
time for completion of the work. The Order shall act as an interim vacant
building permit, the duration of which shall be for the time set forth in the
Building Safety Officer’s order. No interim permit shall be effective for a
PHSO - 9
period of more than ninety (90) days. All work done pursuant to this
article shall be done in compliance with the applicable building, fire
prevention, and zoning statutes and ordinances.
4. The Building Safety Officer shall issue a vacant building permit upon his
or her satisfaction that the building has been inspected and is in
compliance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance, and is
adequately protected from intrusion by trespassers and from deterioration
by the weather. This permit shall be effective for a period of three
hundred sixty-five (365) days.
5. A vacant building or structure shall be deemed adequately protected from
intrusion by trespassers and from deterioration by the weather if it satisfies
the building maintenance standards in Section 5(A) of this Ordinance.
SECTION 11. FEES.
A. A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be charged for a vacant building
permit or interim permit. This one-hundred dollar fee shall also be charged
upon the renewal of such permits. The fee is to be paid at the time of
application or renewal. No permit shall be issued prior to payment of the
permit or renewal fee.
B. Upon a showing that the building or structure is being actively marketed for
sale or lease and maintained pursuant to its vacant building permit or renewal
thereof, the Building Safety Officer shall waive the fee. The waiver of the
permit fee for the active marketing and maintenance of the building or
structure shall be for a period of twelve (12) months from the time the fee first
becomes due. This waiver may be extended for an additional year for such
buildings if the owner (a) continues to show that the building or structure is
being actively marketed for sale and maintained and (b) discloses the details
of how the building was actively marketed for sale during the waiver year
(i.e., offers, appraisals, or consultants engaged). Upon the expiration of the
initial twelve-month period or its extension, the fee shall be charged.
C. When a building is in need of substantial rehabilitation, as determined by the
Building Safety Officer, to comply with the obligations and standards set forth
in this Ordinance, no initial vacant building permit fee is required if the owner
has: (i) developed and submitted a statement of intent, scope of work which
meets the applicable building and zoning standards and the obligations and
standards set forth in this article, and a reasonable schedule for the completion
of the work, approved by the Building Safety Officer, and (ii) secured all
necessary building and zoning permits. To qualify for a continued exemption
upon renewal, the owner must certify that the improvements set forth in the
scope of work are being made according to the schedule of work or prove to
PHSO - 10
the Building Safety Officer that the schedule will be completed within a
reasonable amount of time.
D. If an owner has secured all the duly required permits to demolish the building
or structure, no fee shall be required.
SECTION 12. REPEAL OF PRIOR CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
The enactment of this Ordinance shall repeal all previous ordinances of the City of St.
Albans that regulate the topics addressed herein with the exception of the City’s Land
Development Regulations.
SECTION 13. SEVERABILITY.
If any section of this Ordinance is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
such finding shall not invalidate any other part of this Ordinance.

Council of the City of St. Albans in accordance with 24A V.S.A. Ch. 11, § 17. Last

A. Residential Districts – the following three districts are referred to singularly in these
regulations or grouped as the “residential districts:”
1. Low Density Residential - LDR
2. High Density Residential District – HDR
3. Business-Neighborhood Transition - BNT

Section 302 Zoning District Boundaries
A. Official Zoning Map
The boundaries of the zoning districts established in this Article are as shown upon the
Official Zoning Map of the City of St. Albans which shall be located in the Zoning Office;
except that, the FHOD - Flood Hazard Overlay District is not shown on the Official Zoning
Map. This district includes all areas in the City of St. Albans identified as areas of special
flood hazard on the National Flood Insurance Program maps published by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency which are hereby adopted by reference and are on file in
the Zoning Office.
The City of St. Albans Official Zoning Map shall be the final authority as to the current
zoning status of the land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the City.
B. Interpretation of District Boundaries
1. District boundaries shown within the lines of roads, streams and transportation rights
of way shall be deemed to follow the center of the right-of-way. The abandonment
of roads shall not affect the location of district boundaries. When the Zoning
Administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such
center lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on the zoning map, or by the fact that
it clearly coincides with a property line, the applicant shall be referred to the
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 3-2
Article 3 – Edition April 1, 2019 Other articles may have different edition dates.
Development Review Board before taking any action. The Development Review
Board shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale
of the zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this bylaw.
2. In the Flood Hazard Overlay District, base flood elevations and floodway limits
provided by the National Flood Insurance Program in the Flood Insurance Study and
accompanying maps, where available (Zones A1-A30, AE and AH), shall be used to
administer the provisions of this bylaw. In areas where base flood elevations and
floodway limits have not been provided by the National Flood Insurance Program
(Zone A), base flood elevation and floodway information available from State or
Federal agencies or other sources shall be obtained and reasonably utilized to
administer the provisions of this bylaw.
Section 303 Intent of Districts
A. Residential Districts
1. LDR - Low Density Residential
The intent of this district is to maintain within the City a pleasant and uncrowded
residential area, and to encourage appropriate development and/or redevelopment
that will complement the existing residential land use. This area shall be primarily
for single-family dwellings, along with accessory uses. A variety of other
residential uses, along with selected non-residential uses may be allowed as
conditional uses, provided they meet all applicable standards and can be shown to be
compatible with the district's objectives.
2. HDR - High Density Residential
The intent of this district is to provide an area within the City for moderately dense
residential development and growth, while maintaining a safe and healthy
atmosphere for the district's residents. Single-family dwellings shall be permitted
uses within this district, along with accessory uses. A variety of other residential
uses, along with selected non-residential uses may be allowed as conditional uses,
provided they meet all applicable standards and can be shown to be compatible with
the district's objectives.
3. BNT - Business-Neighborhood Transition
This intent of this district is to provide an area of transition between commercial
areas and other residential districts. This district maintains the densities, dimensional
standards, and character of a pleasant and uncrowded residential area and allows the
types of uses that would historically be found where business districts transition into
residential areas. Single-family and duplex residential uses are allowed, along with
selected non-residential uses as conditional uses, provided they meet all applicable
standards and can be shown to be compatible with the district's objectives.
B. Business Districts
It is the intent of the Business Districts to provide for a wide range of commercial and
related activities to safeguard and enhance the City’s role as the economic center of
northwestern Vermont. It is also the intent of these districts to protect the historic and
cultural characteristics which distinguish the City of St. Albans, and to enable a diverse
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 3-3
Article 3 – Edition April 1, 2019 Other articles may have different edition dates.
range of uses, which contribute to the vitality and diversity of the Business Districts and to
expand the tax base.
1. B1- Central Business Subdistrict
It is the intent of the B1 - Central Business Subdistrict to provide for a diverse range
of business and service uses within the traditional business center of the City. The
subdistrict is intended to protect and enhance the function of the downtown area as
the primary commercial, financial, retail and governmental center of the region. It is
designed to accommodate a wide variety of commercial activities, particularly those
which benefit from pedestrian activity and access. Design criteria for the subdistrict
are intended to protect the National Landmark Historic District and the special urban
features of Taylor Park.
2. B2 – Transitional Business Subdistrict
It is the intent of the B2 - Transitional Business Subdistrict to provide for the
location of a wide range of business activities. These activities support the function
of St. Albans as the primary business center in the region and provide a wide range
of goods and services for local and regional needs outside the downtown area. These
areas are convenient to customers, preserve the carrying capacity of streets and
require the provision of off-street parking and loading. Design criteria for the
subdistrict are intended to encourage the expanded use and preservation of existing
buildings or new construction, alterations, and enlargements compatible with the
architectural character of the subdistrict.
C. MI – Medical Institution District
It is the intent of the MI Medical Institution District to provide a suitable location for health
services of regional importance and associated uses. The district is currently dominated by
the Northwestern Medical Center hospital. This district provides good transportation and
infrastructure access. Due to this district’s proximity to residential uses, special attention
should be paid to the performance standards found in Section 519 of these regulations. Due
to the location of the district at the eastern gateway to the City, ample setbacks are provided
along frontage, and special attention should be paid to lot and building design.
D. S-IND – Service Industrial District
It is the intent of the S-IND Service Industrial District to provide for the location of a wide
variety of service, industrial, manufacturing, distribution and research facilities providing
employment opportunities and broadening of the tax base of the City. These locations
provide good transportation and infrastructure access. All uses shall be in conformance with
the performance standards found in Section 519 of these regulations. Due to the location of
the district adjacent to residential areas, buffering shall be required to minimize conflicts
between non-residential uses and residential districts.
E. FHO- Flood Hazard Overlay District
The intent of this district is to minimize future public and private losses caused by
development in flood hazard areas. Designation of this district is also required for the City's
continued eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. Included in this district are
all areas of special flood hazard as shown on the latest National Flood Insurance Program
maps. The Flood Hazard Overlay District overlaps other districts established in this Bylaw;
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 3-4
Article 3 – Edition April 1, 2019 Other articles may have different edition dates.
where the provisions of the underlying district differ from those of the Flood Hazard
Overlay District, the more restrictive shall govern.
F. St. Albans Historic District
The St. Albans Historic District was included in the National Register of Historic Places
after a survey of contributing historic structures was performed in the center of the City.
The Historic District is not used as a stand-alone district for the purpose of these regulations,
but it is identified as an area where certain uses are restricted, special design
standards/restrictions are used, and other provisions are made or allowed in order to preserve
the area’s nature as a historic urban center with unique architectural designs and an
environment that encourages pedestrian activity. The boundaries of the Historic District are
defined for these regulations based on parcels that contain the structures identified in the
original survey.

four (4) feet high, shall be provided so as to enclose and secure said area when
construction is not being accomplished. Prior to removal of the protective barrier and
upon completion of the construction, the protective barrier shall be replaced with a fence.

Section 413 Planned Unit Developments
A. Authority and Review Process. With the approval of a Planned Unit Development, the
Development Review Board is hereby empowered to vary certain zoning regulations, as
indicated herein, under the criteria and procedures established in Section 4417 of the act.
Any application for a Planned Unit Development that involves a subdivision of land will
be required to receive subdivision approval under Article 8 in addition to any other
approvals required by these regulations.
B. Purpose. The purpose of a planned unit development is to encourage a development
which will result in:
1. A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural topography
and geologic features and prevents soil erosion.
2. An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets.
3. An environment in harmony with surrounding development.
4. A more desirable environment than that which would be possible through the
strict application of other sections of these regulations.
5. For residential planned unit developments, a choice in the types of environment
and living units available to the public and quality in residential land uses.
6. For residential planned unit developments, green space and recreation areas.
C. Application. Proposals for planned unit developments shall be referred to the
Development Review Board by the Zoning Administrator. In addition to any other
application requirements for Conditional Use or Subdivision, the material accompanying
the proposal shall contain the following:
1. A site plan showing all buildings, parking areas, sidewalks, roadways and
landscaping at a scale sufficient to permit the study of all elements of the plan.
2. The location and description of all utilities and rights of way.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 4-11
Article 4 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
3. Elevations of all buildings.
4. The adjacent building outlines and other outstanding features within two hundred
(200) feet.
5. Changes in grading.
D. Development Standards. A planned unit development shall comply with the following
standards:
1. Shall be an allowed use within the district which the project is located.
2. Shall have contiguous acres equal to three times the minimum lot size for the
district for the uses(s) proposed.
3. Lot size, width, front yard depth, and side yard requirements of the district in
which the planned unit development is located may be waived; however, these
shall be evaluated by the Development Review Board on their individual merit,
based on the purposes set forth in Section 804B and the intent of the Municipal
Plan.
4. The permitted number of dwelling units may include a density increase of as
much as twenty-five (25) percent beyond the number which could be permitted if
the land were subdivided into lots in conformance with the zoning regulations for
the district in which the land is located. In granting a density increase, the
Development Review Board shall consider the capacity of community facilities
and services and the character of the area affected.
5. A residential only planned unit development shall set aside open green space for
common usage as follows: for projects up to 1.5 acres at least thirty (30) percent
shall be set aside, and for projects over 1.5 acres, at least fifty (50) percent of the
development shall be set aside. The regulations for control and maintenance of
this open green space shall be approved by the Development Review Board.
E. Rules and Regulations. The Development Review Board may prescribe, from time to
time, rules and regulations to supplement the standards and conditions set forth in these
zoning regulations for planned unit development, provided the rules and regulations are
not inconsistent with the zoning regulations.
Section 414 Determination of Similar Uses
In recognition that every potential use cannot be listed in the Land Development Regulations, the
Development Review Board is authorized to determine if a use not listed within a particular
zoning district is sufficiently similar to other uses to permit that use within the zoning district
without requiring an amendment to the Land Development Regulations. The Development
Review Board shall make a determination of such a similar use according to the following
standards:

Article 4 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
cannot be reasonably collocated at an existing facility, the Development Review
Board shall consider the following factors:
a. The proposed equipment would exceed the structural or spatial capacity of
the existing facility and the existing facility cannot be reinforced, modified or
replaced to accommodate planned equipment at a reasonable cost.
b. The proposed equipment would materially impact the usefulness of other
equipment at the existing facility and such impact cannot be mitigated or
prevented at a reasonable cost.
c. The proposed equipment, alone or together with existing equipment, would
create radio frequency interference and/or radio frequency radiation in
violation of federal standards.
d. Existing towers and structures cannot accommodate the proposed equipment
at an elevation necessary to function reasonably or are too far from the area

habitat or species will be utilized.
14. The Facility will not generate undue noise.
I. Continuing Obligations. The owner of a Wireless Telecommunication Facility shall, at
such times as requested by the Development Review Board, file a certificate showing that
it is in compliance with all FCC standards and requirements regarding radio frequency
radiation, and that adequate insurance has been obtained for the Facility. Failure to file
a certificate within the timeframe requested by the Development Review Board, shall
mean that the Facility has

General Regulations
Section 501 Miscellaneous Requirements of the Act
The following provisions shall apply to all districts except where listed. In accordance with
Section 4412 of the Act, the following shall apply:
A. Undeveloped, Nonconforming Lots
Any undeveloped lot in individual and separate and non-affiliated ownership
from surrounding lots may be developed for the purposes permitted in the district in
which it is located, even though not conforming to minimum lot size requirements, if
such lot is not less than one-eighth acre in area with a minimum width or depth
dimension of forty (40) feet.
Any undeveloped lot which is in single or affiliated ownership with an abutting lot, all or
part of which does not meet the requirements of these regulations, shall be considered,
together with said abutting lot, an individual lot for the purpose of these regulations and
no portion of said lot shall be used or sold which does not meet the requirements of these
regulations.
However, a nonconforming lot shall not be deemed merged and may be separately
conveyed if all the following apply: (i) The lots are conveyed in their preexisting,
nonconforming configuration;(ii) On the effective date of any bylaw, each lot was
developed with a water supply and wastewater disposal system;(iii) At the time of
transfer, each water supply and wastewater system is functioning in an acceptable
manner;(iv) The deeds of conveyance create appropriate easements on both lots for
replacement of one or more wastewater systems, potable water systems, or both, in case
there is a failed system or failed supply as defined in 10 V.S.A. chapter 64. 24 V.S.A. §
4412(2).
B. Required Frontage On, Or Access To, Public Roads
No land development may be permitted on lots which do not have either frontage on a
public road or, with the approval of the Development Review Board, access to such a
road by a permanent easement or right-of-way of record at least twenty (20) feet in width.
A right-of-way may not service more than four (4) dwelling units or service uses not1
permitted or conditional in the district in which the right-of-way originates. The width of
the right-of-way may not be counted for setback requirements. For projects requiring
subdivision approval, the review will take place as part of the subdivision application.
For projects not requiring a subdivision application, conditional use approval will be
1 The inclusion of this word “not” is a typographical correction made since the 01/29/2018 amendment of this
article. The word “not” appeared in the version of this rule that was previously located in Section 401 B. of the
09/12/2005 version of the Land Development Regulation. Somehow the word “not” was erroneously deleted when
this rule was moved to Section 501 B in subsequent versions of the Regulations. There is no evidence of any
amendment proposed to the City Council to remove this word “not.”

within a 1,000 feet radius of another existing or permitted such home.
Section 502 Lots Divided by District Boundaries
Where a district boundary line divides a lot of record, the regulations for the district that contains
the portion of the lot that has frontage on a public road shall apply. When the district boundary
line divides the property line that fronts the public road, the regulations for the district in which
the major part of the property line lies shall apply.
However, when two or more properties located in different zoning districts are reconfigured or
combined, zoning shall apply to the lots as they were originally configured.
Section 503 Principal Buildings
In all residential districts there shall be only one principal building on a lot unless otherwise
approved under the planned unit development.

of the off-street parking requirements of the uses (Section 515.7). Where such facilities are
proposed, the applicant should submit a parking demand analysis identifying the demand of
each component use for various time periods. Changes to any of the component uses that would
impact their off-street parking requirements must be made known to the City permitting office,
in order to ensure that the permit approval of the shared parking facility is still valid. Shared
parking areas in the Business Districts, MI District, and S-IND-Service-Industrial District may
be located on lots adjacent to the principal use or within four hundred (400) feet thereof or if

the Zoning Administrator on an application form or in accordance with
application specifications published by the Zoning Administrator.
2. Application Requirements. An application for the construction, creation, or
installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be
accompanied by detailed drawings, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions,
design, structure, means of illumination, colors and location of each particular
sign. Applications involving freestanding signs shall include a top-down site plan
sketch indicating the proposed sign location and all requisite setbacks.
Applications involving signs attached to the façade of a building shall include a
scaled elevation of the building with proposed location of the sign or a

table 5, footnote d.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 5-28
Article 5 – Edition Feb 3, 2020 Other articles may have different edition dates.
3. Fees. Each application for a sign permit shall be accompanied by the applicable
fees, which shall be established by the City Council from time to time by
resolution.
4. Completeness. Within five days of receiving an application for a sign permit, the
Zoning Administrator shall review it for completeness. If the Zoning
Administrator finds that it is complete, the application shall then be processed. If
the Zoning Administrator finds that it is incomplete, the Zoning Administrator
shall, within such five-day period, send to the applicant a notice of the specific
ways in which the application is deficient, with appropriate references to the
applicable sections of these regulations.
5. Action. Within ten days of the submission of a complete application for a sign
permit, the Zoning Administrator shall either:
a. Reject the sign permit if the sign(s) that is the subject of the application fails
in any way to conform with the requirements of these regulations and does
not meet the criteria for referral to the DAB pursuant to Section
517.2(A)(5)(b). In case of a rejection, the Zoning Administrator shall specify
in the rejection the section(s) of these regulations which the application is
inconsistent with.
b. Refer the sign permit application to the DAB upon the request of the
applicant if the application conforms with all regulations of this section with
the exception of one or both of the following:
i. Section 517.1(A) pursuant to Section 517.1(C)(2)(d);
ii. Section 517.1(K) with regard to only one or more of the following
dimensional requirements:
1. Maximum allowed area of individual signs.
2. Maximum allowed area of signage per business.
3. Setback requirements.
4. Visual clearance area.
c. Issue the sign permit if the sign(s) that is the subject of the application
conforms in every respect with the requirements of these regulations or has
been granted either a favorable review or waiver by the Design Advisory
Board pursuant to Section 517.2(A)(5)(b). Waivers shall be granted pursuant
to Section 517.2(B).
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 5-29
Article 5 – Edition Feb 3, 2020 Other articles may have different edition dates.
6. Expiration. An approved permit shall expire within six (6) months from the date
of such approval unless such sign is erected. The applicant may request a six (6)
month administrative extension of the sign permit, and it is at the discretion of the
Zoning Administrator to grant such an extension. An alteration or removal of a
sign that is included on a permit for multiple signs, whose alteration would
require a new permit, shall not affect the permit status of the other signs under the
original permit. A temporary sign permit shall expire 30 days from the date of
such approval.
B. Waivers
The Design Advisory Board may reduce dimensional restrictions by up to fifty (50)
percent for items listed in Section 517.2(A)(5)(b)(ii) in cases where conditions exist that
affect the ability to otherwise meet such requirements. No waiver shall be granted that
would have an undue adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the area or on
public health and safety. The board shall provide only the minimum waiver that will
represent the least deviation possible from the bylaw.
C. Revocation, Removal, and Enforcement
1. Any or all permits under this chapter may be revoked by the Zoning
Administrator at any time and any sign may be ordered removed whenever, in the
opinion of the Zoning Administrator, public necessity, safety, or convenience
require such removal, and such removal shall be at the owner's expense.
2. Any sign, which has been ordered removed by the Zoning Administrator, or is
abandoned or discontinued, shall be removed within 30 days of written notice to
remove. Any structure, wall, surface or other area from which the sign is removed
shall be disassembled and/or restored so that no remnant of the sign is visible.
3. All violations of Section 517 shall be enforced pursuant to Section 906 of these
regulations.
Section 517.3 Computation Standards and Signage Definitions
A. Computations
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height.
1. Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign face (which is also
the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by
means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or triangle that will encompass the
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together
with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against
which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 5-30
Article 5 – Edition Feb 3, 2020 Other articles may have different edition dates.
decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets land
development regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
2. Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more
than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces
visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back,
so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when
such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches
apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
3. Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance
from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1)
existing grade prior to construction (2) the newly established grade after
construction, exclusive any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for
the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot
reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that
the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation
of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the
principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
4. Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Business. The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs per business shall be computed
by applying the formula contained in Table 2 of Section 517.1(K), Maximum
Total Sign Area, to the lot frontage, building frontage, or wall area, as
appropriate, for the zoning district in which the lot is located. Businesses fronting
on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.
However, the total sign area that is oriented towards a particular street may not
exceed the portion of the businesses total sign area allocation that is derived from
the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.
B. Definitions and Interpretations

adjacent areas or wetlands.
B. In making findings relative to these criteria, the DRB shall be authorized to invoke
technical review by a qualified professional in hydrology, geomorphology, or other
related science whose services shall be paid for by the applicant. The DRB may also rely
on the issuance of a Stream Alteration Permit issued by the Vermont Department of
Environmental Conservation as evidence that the above criteria have been met.
C. In order to ensure compliance with the criteria above, the DRB may also place additional
conditions upon the applicant for approval of a stream alteration/bank maintenance
application, including riparian plantings and improvements to other properties and rightsof-
way.
D. Stream alteration and bank maintenance applications to the DRB shall be subject to the
same hearing notice requirements as conditional use applications with additional abutter’s
notices sent to the adjacent upstream and cross-stream properties, as well as all properties
200 feet downstream. These additional abutter’s notice requirements shall also apply to
site plan applications that propose stream alteration and bank maintenance.

Article 7
Design Review
Section 701 Purposes
The intent and purpose of this article is to:
1. Preserve the historic architectural resources of the city.
2. Ensure that new infill development, redevelopment and reconstruction are sensitive to
context and the historic architecture and patterns.
3. Promote architectural, landscape, sign, and site design treatments that enhance the visual
appearance of development within the Design Review (DR) Overlay Districts and
downtown St. Albans.
4. Support pedestrian activity and scale along the street and between buildings as well as
multi-modal travel.
5. Create and maintain a strong community image and identity by providing for
architectural and landscape treatments that enhance the visual quality of all development
in St. Albans and thus enhancing the visitor experience, the attractiveness of the
streetscape and the existing architecture of the community.
Section 702 Scope and Authority
These regulations shall be applicable to all new construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
exterior alterations, and changes to outward appearance including color or siding, or demolition
within the Design Review (DR) Overlay Districts. These regulations shall also apply to any
structure listed on or eligible for the National or Vermont State Register of Historic Places.
For any structure in a Design Review District, the Zoning Administrator shall solicit a
recommendation from the Design Advisory Board before issuing a building permit. Each project
shall be evaluated with regard to how it achieves an overall design that meets the intent and
directions of the Design Review Standards. If the Design Advisory Board does not grant a
favorable recommendation, then the application shall be referred to the Development Review
Board for a final determination under these regulations.
These Design Review Standards are intended to assist property owners, developers, and the City
review boards with the preliminary planning, design, and evaluation of proposals and approval of
projects. The “shall” and other similar definitive statements indicate mandatory requirements
and offer relatively little flexibility unless choices are provided within the statements themselves.
All projects must include these elements as described. However, statements that use the word
“should” or “encourage” are meant to be applied, but with some flexibility. They indicate that
the City is open to design features that are equal to, or better than, those stated - so long as the
intent is satisfied. The applicant assumes the burden of proof to demonstrate how a proposed
design meets the standards and determination will be made by the City. This section is intended
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-2
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
to act in conjunction with the City of St. Albans’ Land Development Regulations. In the event
of a conflict or discrepancy between the two documents, the more restrictive standard shall
apply.
Section 703 Applicability and District Descriptions
B. DR - Design Review Overlay Districts
Within the limits established for Design Review, there shall be indicated four Design Review
Overlay Districts for the purpose of applying the review criteria in Section 706. These districts
are as indicated on the Applicable Districts Map in section 703.A with the following
designations:
• DR1 - Traditional Downtown
• DR2 - Downtown Expansion
• DR3 - Residential
• DR4 - Gateway
Each of the Design Review Overlay Districts in the City of St. Albans has distinct site
development patterns and architectural characteristics. The identification of historic and/or
desirable patterns within each of these districts is a critical element in determining the “fit” and
ensuring the appropriate relationship of a proposed project or activity within the specific district.
The physical characteristics of a proposed project or activity, including the project’s architecture,

and adaptive re-use of historic architecture is strongly encouraged. Infill,
renovation and revitalization of the City’s core shall respect and preserve the
“main street” character, walk ability, public spaces and the sharing of parking and
other public infrastructure, which reflects the historic urban form of the City. The
district places emphasis on and the preservation of historic resources and the
character of the historic downtown as a part of a vibrant central business district.
Buildings in the Traditional Downtown (DR1) are mixed-use with premium local
and regional boutique retail uses and entertainment establishments, fostering a
multicultural environment. Residential or office use above the ground floor is
encouraged.

developments, housing street front retail and restaurant services with residential
and office use above the ground floor, where feasible. Architecture of a historic
nature shall be used in conjunction with contemporary designs. Beautification
and building upkeep are encouraged, utilizing signage, awnings and greenery for
an aesthetically pleasing environment. Architecture should reflect historic forms
and materials and adaptive re-use of historic architecture is encouraged. New
structures and additions or alterations to existing structures shall be designed in a

the traditional downtown and is intended for the preservation and enhancement of
its historic pattern, architectural scale and green space. It is characterized by
dense, compact development with a mix of housing types. Similar setbacks,
footprints, scale, mass and height are expected to continue. Existing vegetation
and the pedestrian-oriented environment shall be maintained. Emphasis shall be
placed on the preservation of the tree lined boulevard quality of Main Street and
the surrounding streetscape. Low-intensity business activity is permitted at
residential scale, which includes home occupations or professional offices that are
unobtrusive and fit within the character of the neighborhood. New development
and redevelopment in these neighborhoods shall reflect the existing and desirable

upon entering the City, to establish an image and character that is uniquely St.
Alban's, as well as to fulfill the service demands of nearby neighborhoods,
residents, and visitors. Signing and lighting associated with the commercial
density and transitioning land use that currently exists in this district is
inconsistent with the historic, residential quality of these areas. These areas are
distinct with regard to the presence of specific transportation infrastructure, with
the north gateway just south of an important intersection and the terminus of the
MVRT; and the south gateway having the Interstate connector and intersection.
New construction, conversions or rehabilitation of existing structures should
continue existing historic scale and setbacks. Site plans shall reference and relate
to the historic greenbelt and provide creatively screened and located parking
areas.

Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
A. Architecture & Historic Preservation
Development and rehabilitation shall reference, respect and preserve historic architecture as
appropriate. New building design needs to reflect use, context, and contribute to the community
fabric. Elements to consider include:
1. Prominent Entrance
a) All buildings shall have at least one principal front entry with a canopy or
articulated architecture that is welcoming and easily identifiable from streets and
sidewalks.
b) Building entries and facades should be designed to enhance pedestrian comfort
and provide visual interest through the use of arches, arcades, awnings, large
entry doors, overhangs, display windows, landscaping, special paving, lighting,
and other architectural elements.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-11
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
c) Some form of weather protection should be provided at entries. This can be
combined with any method used to achieve visual prominence, such as canopies,
porticos, porches, awnings or overhangs.
Figure 1. Prominent Entrance - A building should have a clearly delineated entrance
that provides safe and logical entry to the interior spaces.
2. Massing & Scale
a) The majority of the building mass shall be located close to the road to help define
the street edge and to help orient users, in accordance with existing or applicable
setbacks (pattern).
b) The size, scale, motif and use of materials for the front façade design shall be kept
consistent across the façade and with adjacent buildings in order to tie the entire
composition together. The use of a variety of design styles across the façade and
with adjacent buildings is not recommended. Original historic architectural detail
or elements should be preserved and replicated to the optimum extent practicable.
c) Building volume shall be divided into a variety of shapes or materials to help
reduce the perceived scale of the architecture. Building elements that provide
scale and establish street side rhythms include: columns, windows, doorways,
n

roof segments, wall patterns, lighting fixtures, signs, paving patterns, landscape
elements.
Figure 2. Building Detail and Patterns - Building elements shall be designed or retained
to reflect historic architectural motifs, proper rhythm and symmetry.
d) Large-scale features or significant areas of blank wall are not permitted near the
front of the site or along the road right-of-way.
e) The rhythm of building massing is important in creating a visually consistent
environment. This involves the organization of building elements or spaces
between them in a logical and sequential manner. Windows, columns or bay
spacing should be kept as consistent as possible on the façade.
Figure 3. Building Massing, Scale and Rhythm - New structures and infill buildings
should reflect the scale of the street and the architectural patterns present.

Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
3. Context
a) Building design shall be sensitive to the overall character and context of the
design review district in which it is located and to adjacent buildings. In
particular, new development and redevelopment in the Traditional Downtown
(DR1) shall incorporate historic architectural elements that reinforce the
established character of that district. The following elements constitute potential
existing features that could be reflected in new buildings:
i. materials
ii. window proportions and openings
iii. cornice or canopy lines
iv. roof treatment
v. colors
b) Separate structures (carwash, canopies over gas pumps, etc.) on a site shall have
the same or compatible architectural detail, design elements and roof design as the
primary structure, including a comparable pitch or parapets for roofs, same
cornice treatment, same materials and colors, etc.
4. Roof Design & Mechanical Equipment Screening
a) Rooflines shall present a distinct profile and appearance for the building. Subtle

breaks and fluctuations in the roofline are encouraged to highlight important areas
of the building (such as the entry) and break up longer stretches of roof area. The
roof of the building should be in keeping with the scale and historic context of the
structure itself.
b) Only a small portion of roof area should be flat provided it is not visible from the
public street, existing or planned, or does not detract from the overall design and
harmony of the building. Where portions of a roof are flat, architectural elements
such as extended parapets and projecting cornices shall be used to create a
prominent edge when viewed against the sky.
c) Rooftop equipment and fixtures shall be concealed from eye-level view from any
public right-of-way and from the ground level of any adjacent properties. In
addition, they shall be visually minimized with painted colors and finish
complementary to the overall building design.
Figure 4 - Rooftop Equipment – Rooftop equipment shall be screened or located
away from public view.
d) Mechanical units on the ground (condensers, generators, etc.) shall be screened
from view with wing walls, landscaping, or a combination of both.
5. Drive-thru Businesses
a) Drive-thru windows shall be located along the sides or rear of the building. Drivethru
windows shall not be allowed between the building and the street.
b) Canopies, where applicable, shall have the same or compatible architectural
detail, design elements and roof design as the primary structure, including a
comparable pitch or parapets for roofs, same cornice treatment, same materials
and colors, etc.

Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
Figure 5. Drive-thru Businesses - Drive through businesses must have drive through
facilities located to the side or rear of the building and the canopies shall relate in
architectural style and design to the buildings to which they are attached.
6. Fencing
a) Walls and fences should harmonize with the site and the buildings on it in scale as
well as in materials. Barbed wire, chain-link and security fencing (razor-wire,
concertina wire) are prohibited. Appropriate fence materials include wood, stone,
masonery and/or decorative metals.
b) Fencing shall not dominate the buildings or landscape.
7. Materials and Colors
a) Selecting materials and colors that fit within the context of the site and
surroundings is required in the Traditional Downtown (DR1) and recommended
in all other design review districts. An example of this would be to use a brick or
brick color and/or a pleasing contrasting color when this material and color is
present in adjacent buildings or sites.
b) The choice of colors can help to express a building’s architecture, but care should
be given to avoid discordant or unusually bright color schemes and those, which
may be offensive or glaring to the public when viewed from the site or road. The
main color theme should be of a natural or muted shade. Brighter, more vibrant
colors such as red or yellow should be reserved for minor accents and highlights
only, and should be used sparingly.
c) Colors should be coordinated throughout a building’s exterior in concert with
other site elements such as fencing, outbuildings and signing.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-16
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
d) When a variety of colors are used on a building, one color should be used as the
predominant or primary color, with the other (secondary) colors used for the trim,
corner boards and other details. The secondary colors can add interesting accents
to a building and its architectural details and enrich a façade design, when chosen
in a complementary fashion.
e) When a variety of materials are used on a building, one material should be used as
the predominant or primary finish, with the other materials used for different
architectural or building elements.
f) Materials selected should either fit the context of the proposed building and/or
reflect the nature and use of the structure. Materials need to be selected for longterm
performance and durability (see Table 1. Recommended Materials on
following page).
g) Colors that are used should reflect the color patterns and recommendations
provided for in the reference document “The Colors of St. Albans”, St. Albans
downtown, as prepared by St. Albans for the Future (SAFF) and available for
review in the city zoning office.
Table 1. Recommended Materials
The following table provides a sampling of appropriate or recommended materials for the design
review districts and is intended as a general guide. Actual exterior materials and colors shall be
approved by the City. Materials listed in the “Not Recommended” column, or materials not
specifically listed in this chart, are not permitted unless otherwise approved by the City:

8. Franchises
a) “Off the shelf” standardized franchise architecture is not permitted in St. Albans.
Franchise operations that are proposed for existing buildings, infill locations, or as
standalone structures must employ an architectural design that either reflects the
local setting or can be demonstrated to fit in a contextual, harmonious manner
with the character of its surroundings.
b) Chain stores and franchises shall use materials and detailing that are compatible
with nearby buildings and blend with the existing landscape. Existing historic or
older homes and buildings can be restored to accommodate chain stores and
franchises.

The Design Advisory Board is enabled to apply the standards of Section 415 of these
regulations as part of the Design Review process.
10. Historic Preservation
a) In addition to the following standards, the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings shall also
be used as a guide for any changes, modifications and repair to existing buildings
of historic and architectural significance. (Note: Tax credits may be available to
applicants who follow these guidelines.)
b) Rehabilitation of Historic Structures:
i. Respect the original design character of the building.
ii. New uses that require the least change to existing structures are
encouraged.
iii. Every reasonable effort should be made to provide a compatible use for
the building that will require minimal alteration to the building and its site.
iv. Avoid removing or altering any historic material or significant
architectural features.
v. Original materials and details that contribute to the historic significance of
the structure are qualities that should be preserved whenever feasible.
vi. Use material similar to those employed historically where feasible. If
alternate materials must be used, they should match the original in
appearance, design, color, texture and other visual qualities as closely as is
possible.
vii. Where reconstruction of an element is impossible because of a lack of
historical evidence, then a new design that relates to the building in

general size, scale and material may be considered.
c) Additions to Historic Structures:
i. Construct new additions so that there is the least possible loss of historic
fabric and so that the character-defining features of the historic building
are not destroyed, damaged, or obscured.
ii. Protect large trees and other significant site features from immediate
damage during construction and from delayed damage due to construction
activities.
iii. Locate a new addition on an inconspicuous elevation of the historic
building, usually the rear one.
iv. Limit the size and the scale of an addition in relationship to the historic
building so that it does not diminish or visually overpower the building.
v. Avoid impacts to special moldings, decorative windows or dormers.
vi. Design an addition to be compatible with the historic building in mass,
materials, color, and relationship of solids to voids in the exterior walls,
yet make the addition discernible from the original.
d) Historic Commercial Structures:
i. Maintain the large display windows that are characteristic of commercial
buildings.
ii. The traditional "storefront" image shall be preserved at the street level.
iii. When replacing glass or restoring windows, maintain the original size and
shape of the storefront opening.
iv. Preserve the original size and shape of upper story windows.
v. Maintain original recessed entries where they exist.
vi. Preserve original roof forms where they contribute to the historic character
of the building.
vii. Maintain original roof materials where they are visible to the street.
e) Demolition of Historic Structures:
i. The demolition of historic structures is discouraged and shall be
considered only as a last resort. If acceptable alternatives are not possible,
the following must be met:
1. The significance of the structure, gardens, landscaping and
outbuildings, if any, shall be assessed and recorded. A photographic
record that includes scale shall be made as part of the site inventory
work. Significant architectural features or items of historical
importance shall be identified.
2. Public interest for structural preservation shall be sought and
considered. Salvage options, whether through the City or other
appropriate groups with interest in local history, shall be proposed as
part of the demolition proposal.
3. Circumstances and condition of the structure shall be evaluated. A
qualified engineer’s opinion on the structural integrity of the building
shall be obtained, together with an estimate of needed stabilization
and necessary code compliance work to be performed.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-20
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
4. The physical and economic feasibility is part of the decision to
approve a demolition. Using comparable rehabilitated structure
values, and income if applicable, rehabilitation cost vs. new
redevelopment cost shall be provided for consideration. Efforts shall
be made to develop and offer alternative plans, including financing
help through low-cost loans and other incentives to attract interested
users and project developers.
5. The City has 90 days to find acceptable alternatives to the demolition,
if it feels that it is physically and economically feasible.
6. See also Section 706 of this Ordinance as it refers to demolition.
B. Landscape & Streetscape
The landscape and streetscape patterns of St. Albans have been established and can be
enhanced with new development. Providing safe and walk able public spaces coupled with
the further development of street trees and the “urban forest”, as well as sensitivity to
overall community beautification provide the basis for landscape and streetscape design
and development. Applicants are also encouraged to seek the assistance of the City
Arborist or Tree Steward in the planning and design of landscaped areas. Considerations
for landscaping and tree planting are as follows in this section. Areas to address include:
1. Street Tree/Streetscape Pattern
a) Street trees shall be maintained and used to provide sufficient shading and an
aesthetically pleasing environment for pedestrians, to reduce impervious cover
and to partially mitigate the effects of automobile exhaust and other adverse urban
conditions.
b) New development with internal streets or fronting on public streets shall provide
street tree plantings 40 feet (desired) to 60 feet (maximum) distance on center
with 2.5 - 3 inch caliper minimum diameter.
c) Tree selection should match the site and existing conditions; it should support and
enhance the relationship of architecture to the streetscape. Selections should
reflect municipal and state standards for appropriate species.
d) The streetscape should create meaningful spaces for pedestrians that draw them in
and provide amenities such as benches.
e) Adequate area (5' width minimum) at edges of roads, parking lots and within
treebelts, if necessary, should be provided for snow piling.
f) If trees are to be planted under powerlines, specific varieties should be selected
which do not exceed the height of the lowest line when full grown. Larger trees
can be planted if they are offset from the utility lines. Columnar trees may also be
considered.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-21
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
g) The applicant is encouraged to employ the appropriate tree species for the use or
location for which it is intended. Appropriate documents that are readily available
provide guidance on the use of plant materials and street trees in Vermont and the
applicant is encouraged to reference these publications which include: (Selecting
Trees for Urban Landscape Ecosystems: State of New Hampshire Department of
Resources and Economic Development Division of Forests and Lands. 1994;
Recommended Trees for Vermont Communities: A Guide to Selecting and
Purchasing Street, Park, and Landscape Trees. The Vermont Urban &
Community Forestry Program. 2001; Landscape Plants for Vermont. University
of Vermont Extension. 2002).
Figure 7 – Trees under power lines – Select the appropriate tree with respect to mature
height for under power or utility lines so it will not have to be pruned.
h) Island and treebelt surrounds should include cobble, groundcover, and low
decorative fencing with bark mulch, gravel or groundcover.
i) The recommended minimum island width for tree planting is 6'. When using
cobble surround, a minimum of 12'' width should be maintained around the trunk.
j) Tree roots can expand under the pavement. A composite native/structural soil is
recommended with structural soil under the paver.
k) Bio-retention is one of several stormwater filtering systems that should be
employed in parking lot and site designs. Other methods aside from bio-retention
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-22
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
include: 1) sand filters (i.e. underground, organic or perimeter), and 2) vegetated
channels (i.e. grass channels, dry/wet swales, filter strips).
l) Native plants selected need to be hardy and resistent to salt and other pollutants.
m) Plantings in islands or streetside treebelts should avoid placement atop
underground utilities wherever possible, or provide provisions to protect both
trees and utilities such as root barriers in urban conditions.
n) Along streets plant materials shall be selected and placed to avoid blocking sight
lines at intersections and curb cuts.
2. Native Landscaping/Restoration
a) The use of Vermont native or naturalized species with proven performance and
hardiness is encouraged.
b) Existing vegetation shall be retained as much as possible. The preservation of
mature plant species is recommended and included as a design element.
c) Vegetative stabilization techniques and/or retention methodologies using natural
materials rather than structureal means for slope retention are encouraged.
d) Bio-retention areas in parking lots and development sites are encouraged to treat
stormwater runoff in a natural manner by detaining it and filtering it as it
percolates through plantings and sand filter beds.
e) Underplanting of shrubs and groundcovers is encouraged as an alternative to
mulch and lawns and to serve as a part of the stormwater management plan for a
site by providing detention and filtration functions.
3. Overall Landscape Plan
a) The overall landscape plan should be designed for energy conservation and
environmental comfort and be aesthetically pleasing throughout the seasons.
b) Functional landscaping should be considered; design techniques that stabilize
slopes, provide low maintenance alternatives to lawn areas, reduce erosion and
reinforce pedestrian circulation routes should be employed.
c) Landscape buffers between dissimilar or conflicting land uses are encouraged.
d) Landscape planting of suitable numbers and sizes is encouraged around building
foundations to create pedestrian scale spaces, maintain a landscape continuity, and
enhance visual appearance. Plantings should be in massings to provide impact
and presence and to avoid a chaotic planting effect.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-23
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
e) Transformers, dumpsters and other site utilities and infrastructure should
incorporate landsape elements to screen them from view. Two options include: 1)
incorporating the screening element into the architectural design of the building or
utility buildings on the site (employing wing walls, for example), or 2) setting the
transformer or other such utility within a proposed planting bed rather than
creating a rectilinear planting around the transformer designed specifically to
screen it.
4. Innovative Landscape Design
a) Applicants are encouraged to employ innovative landscape design methodologies
such as: 1) green roof technologies for energy conservation and storm water
management; 2) Structural Soils under sidewalks and plazas to provide suitable
areas for root systems to support tree plantings within sidewalk and plaza areas
that would otherwise be unsuitable for such plantings; and, 3) Rain Garden
landscaping that absorbs, filters and/or delays runoff from impermeable surface
areas.
b) Where tree size landscaping is not possible, new developments should incorporate
planters or containers to provide areas for shrubs, perennial and annual plantings.
5. Landscaping in Stream Corridor Areas and Riparian Buffer Areas
a) The provisions of Section 523 shall apply to properties in the Stream Corridor Area.
C. Signs
NOTE: Signs will need to comply with all applicable provisions of Section 517 of these
Land Use Regulations. In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the two
regulations, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
Signs play an important role in the visual landscape through their design and messaging,
by promoting economic vitality, and by providing guidance and information. Criteria to
be addressed include:
1. Integration with Site and Building Design
a) Sign needs should be determined primarily by criteria established by the
building’s architecture, the relative size of the sign, and the message.
b) Signs shall be designed as a part of the overall design approach to a project and
not an afterthought. It is expected that signs shall fit with the architectural
character, proportions, materials, colors, lighting and other details of the
development.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-24
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
c) All integrated commercial developments (e.g. multiple tenants or buildings) shall
have a uniform sign program or master plan to ensure compatibility throughout
the project. The program or master plan shall also identify locations and
maximum sizes for future signs.
d) Sign placement should take into account whether pedestrians, motorists or both
will view the sign.
e) Signs shall not project above the roof, parapet or exterior wall. No sign shall
cover architectural details such as, but not limited to, arches, sills, moldings,
cornices and transom windows.
f) Signs along roadways, especially monument signs, should be integrated with site
landscaping.
2. Creativity and Artistry
a) Creatively illustrated signs are encouraged and should be graphic in form,
expressive, and distinctive, with a strong visual relationship to the business image.
b) Signs supported by ornamental brackets and oriented to pedestrians are strongly
encouraged.
3. Legibility and Visibility
a) Signs should be legible and appropriate to the business and its project image.
Generally, size of sign should be determined by the function of the sign, with an
emphasis on smaller, people-sized signs. For example, shops and restaurants
should be smaller, personalized signs; while major destinations and shopping
centers should be larger signs so that they can be viewed by a moving car.
b) Appropriate constrast between lettering and background are to be employed.
c) Avoid glare and too much reflective surface.
d) Proper letter height and visibility is necessary in response to the nature of the
street and the speed limit. Appropriate typeface is critical to image and
messaging.
e) Limits to the amount of information on any one sign may be required for legibility
and safety purposes.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-25
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
D. Lighting
NOTE: Lighting will need to comply with all applicable provisions of Section 517 and 518
of these Land Use Regulations. In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the two
regulations, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
Lighting not only addresses nighttime activity on sites and in districts, but also must be
developed in concert with state of the art technology in illumination. Safety and
sufficient lighting quality are integral to the development of new lighting plans for
buildings and their sites. Criteria to be addressed include:
1. Illumination & Uniformity
a) All lighting shall be glare-free and shielded from the sky and adjacent residential
properties and structures, either through exterior shields or through optics within
the fixture, to include “cut-off” technology that controls light spread.
b) High pressure sodium luminaires shall not be employed, unless demonstrated to
have appropriate color correction technology.
c) Parking area light fixtures should be designed with a concealed/recessed light
source that shields light downward and confines light spread and shall not exceed
a maximum of 20 feet in height.
d) Lighting levels and design should comply with the Illuminating Engineering
Society of North America’s Recommended Practices and Design Guidelines,
latest edition. Energy efficient lighting sources are recommended, and may be
required at the discretion of the City. The City may have the right to impose time
limitations on lighting.
e) Where practical, exterior lighting installations shall include dimmers, sensors, or
photocell controllers that turn the lights off during daylight hours or hours when
lighting is not needed, to reduce impacts on the night sky, overall energy
consumption, and unneeded lighting.
f) The minimum illumination level for an outdoor parking lot shall be maintained at
0.2 horizontal foot-candles at grade level, except for periods of non-use, and the
uniformity ratio shall not exceed (average/minimum) 4:1.
g) Applicants may need to demonstrate that the foot-candle level at the property line
does not exceed pre-existing levels. If there is no lighting present or in the vicinity
of the property line, then the applicant installing new lighting may be required to
demonstrate a 0.0-0.2 maximum foot-candle level at adjacent property lines.
h) Projects proposing parking lots with 20 or more spaces shall be required to
provide a photometric plans showing isolumens or footcandle patterns on the
ground and demonstrating no light trespass to other properties.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-26
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
i) Lighting fixtures shall be aimed and shielded in a manner that shall not direct
illumination on adjacent residential districts. Fixtures should be of a type or
adequately shielded so as to prevent glare from normal viewing angles. Where
feasible, additional landscaping may be required by the City to provide light
screening between commercial districts and residential districts to help prevent
light trespass.
2. Fixtures
a) All outdoor lighting not necessary for security purposes shall be reduced,
activated by motion sensor devices, or turned off during non-operating hours.
b) The same type poles and fixtures should be used throughout a multi-building
project site and be compatible in size with adjoining properties.
c) Poles should be located in medians and buffer areas. Concrete bases for poles
should be kept at grade or no higher than 6 inches above grade, except if located
in an open parking area outside of islands.
d) Low intensity wall mounted decorative lights may be incorporated into the site’s
design, as well as accent lighting to highlight special focal points, building/site
entrances, public art and special landscape features.
3. Night Sky Friendly Lighting (for both signs and lighting)
Night sky friendly lighting shall be:
a) Shielded and employ cut off technology
b) Properly aimed so as to not create undue glare or light trespass
c) Operated by motion sensors or turned off by 11:00 PM
e) Energy efficient fixtures with appropriate wattage.
f) Lighting of public buildings, monuments, flagpoles and special architectural
features for non-commercial purposes is permitted if appropriate and minimal
lighting levels are employed and only with the review and approval by the
appropriate Board. Such lighting should reflect, to the greatest extent possible, the
provisions of the Outdoor Lighting Code Handbook, Version 1.14, available for
review in the Zoning Offices or on line at www.darksky.org, the website of the
International Dark Sky Association.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-27
Article 7 – Edition January 29, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
4. Pedestrian Scale
a) Pedestrian walkways, courtyards and other connections should be reinforced with
pedestrian scale lighting, bollard lighting, accent lighting or a combination of to
aid in pedestrian wayfinding and safety.
b) Pedestrian scale lighting shall be a maximum of 16 feet in height.
c) Where warranted or necessary the City may approve limited security lighting,
with a preference for motion-activated systems. A complete security lighting plan
will need to be sumbitted for approval.
E. Site Design & Development
Site plans should reflect positive historical and cultural site development patterns found in
the applicable districts and create meaningful spaces for people that promote both function
and circulation. Because different patterns exist in various sections of St. Albans’ Design
Review Districts, it is important to assess the patterns of adjacent properties. Factors that
must be addressed include:
1. Compatibility & Character
a) Site design and layout of new buildings and additions and their associated
elements should be compatible with desirable patterns or designs, which are part
of the identified and existing context and surroundings for the project.
b) Reconstruction and redevelopment projects as well as new site and building
construction should reflect the desired character of the district and best design
practices to ensure aesthetic and functional compatibility.
2. Setback Pattern
a) Rhythm should be maintained by establishing uniform building setbacks along the
public right-of-way. It is particularly important that a traditional spacing pattern
be maintained as seen from the street. Align buildings with neighboring
buildings, which are also close to the front setback line. Landscaping can also be
used to reinforce this line.
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 7-28

B. Public Hearing. Within 30 days of deeming that the preliminary plan application is
complete, the Development Review Board shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary
plan, warned in accordance with Section 908. The applicant, project engineer(s) and
others working on the project should plan to attend the public hearing.
C. Preliminary Plan Approval. Within 45 days of the date of adjournment of the public
hearing, the Development Review Board shall approve, approve with modifications, or
disapprove the preliminary plan and associated plat based on a determination of whether
or not the preliminary plan conforms to applicable Subdivision review standards under
Article 8, or would be in conflict with the St. Albans City Comprehensive Plan and other
municipal regulations in effect. When granting preliminary approval to a Preliminary
Plat, the Development Review Board shall state the conditions of such approval, if any,
with respect to:
1. the specific changes which it will require to the Preliminary Plat,
2. the character and extent of the required improvements for which waivers may
have been requested and which in its opinion may be waived without jeopardy to
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare,
3. the requirement for bonds or other surety it may require as a prerequisite to
the approval of the Subdivision Plat.
The action of the Development Review Board plus any conditions attached thereto shall be
noted on three (3) copies of the Preliminary Plat. One copy shall be returned to the
subdivider, one retained by the Development Review Board and one filed with the Zoning
Administrator.
The approval of a preliminary plan shall be effective for a period of six (6) months from
the date of written notice of approval, unless otherwise approved or extended by the
Development Review Board in the written notice of decision.
D. Phasing. At the time that the Development Review Board grants preliminary plan
approval it may require the plat to be divided into two or more phases to ensure project
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and any Capital Budget and Program currently
in effect. Conditions may be imposed upon the filing of an application for final plat
approval for each phase as the Board deems necessary to ensure the orderly development
of the plat and to avoid overburdening town facilities and services.
E. Effect of Preliminary Plan Approval. Approval of the preliminary plan shall not
constitute approval of the final Subdivision plan and plat. Subsequent to the approval of
the preliminary plan, the Development Review Board may require the submission of all
applicable approvals of municipal officials and/or agencies having jurisdiction over the
project (e.g., Select Board, Health Officer), and such state and federal agencies as may be
required by law. Upon receipt of evidence of approval of the preliminary plan by said
agencies, if required, and the expiration of all relevant appeal periods, the applicant may
apply to the Development Review Board for final plan approval under Section 806.

and Subdivision regulations. The application for final Subdivision plan and plat approval
shall include associated fees and the information as required in Table 8.1, unless
otherwise specified or waived by the Development Review Board under Section 802. The
application shall include two (2) full size and ten (10) 11x17 copies.
B. Public Hearing. Within 30 days of the date that the Development Review Board deems
that a final plan application is complete, the Board shall hold a public hearing on the final
plan and associated plat, warned and held in accordance with Section 908. Copies of the
hearing notice shall also be sent, at least 15 days prior to the hearing date, to the clerk of
an adjacent municipality in the case of a plat located within 500 feet of a municipal
boundary. The applicant, project engineer(s) and others working on the project should
plan to attend the public hearing.
C. Final Plan Approval. In accordance with the Act, within 45 days of the date of
adjournment of the public hearing, the Development Review Board shall approve,
approve with conditions, or disapprove the final Subdivision plan, based on a
determination of whether or not the plan and associated plat conform to Subdivision
review standards under Article 8, or would be in conflict with the St. Albans City
Comprehensive Plan and other municipal regulations in effect. Failure to act within such
45 day period shall be deemed approval, effective the 46th day, as certified by the City
Clerk. Approval, conditions of approval, or grounds for disapproval, and provisions for
appeal shall be set forth in a written notice of decision. The notice of decision shall be
sent by certified mail to the applicant and any other interested parties participating in the
public hearing within the 45 day period. Copies of the decision shall also be sent to every
person or body appearing and having been heard at the hearing, and filed with the
Administrative Officer and the City Clerk as part of the public records of the
municipality.
D. Effect of Final Plan Approval. The approval by the Development Review Board of a
final Subdivision plan and associated plat shall not be construed to constitute acceptance
of any legal interest by the City of any street, easement, utility, park, recreation area, or
other open space shown on the final plat. Such acceptance may be accomplished only by
a formal resolution of the City Council, in accordance with state statute. Each approval
for a final plan shall contain a time limit within which all improvements necessary for the
subsequent development of the subdivided lots (e.g., roads, utilities) shall be completed,
not to exceed 3 years unless otherwise required or extended by the Development Review
Board.

improvements by the applicant, the subdivider shall file with the City Treasurer a
financial guarantee to cover the full cost of the required improvements in an
amount set by the Zoning Administrator, as instructed by the Development
Review Board. Any such financial guarantee shall be satisfactory to the Zoning
Administrator as to form, sufficiency, manner of execution and surety. A period
of one (1) year (or such other period as the Development Review Board may
determine appropriate, not to exceed three (3) years) shall be set forth in the time
within which required improvements must be completed.
Section 808 Required Standards
The following are required standards for Subdivisions in the City of St. Albans. The

regulations and ordinances, and a performance bond to ensure completion of such
improvements shall be provided by the subdivider.
D. If at any time before or during the construction of the required improvements it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Manager that unforeseen conditions make it
necessary or preferable to modify the location or design of such required improvements,
the City Manager may authorize modifications provided these modifications are within
the spirit and intent of the Development Review Board's approval and do not constitute a
waiver or substantial alteration of the function of any improvements required by the
Development Review Board. The City Manager shall issue any authorization under this
section in writing and shall transmit a copy of such authorization to the Development
Review Board at their next regular meeting.
E. If the City Manager shall find, upon inspection of the improvements performed before the
expiration date of the financial guarantee, that any of the required improvements have not
been constructed in accordance with plans and specifications filed by the subdivider, the
Manager shall report to the Zoning Administrator and Development Review Board. The
City shall notify the subdivider and take all necessary steps to preserve the City's rights

form satisfactory to the City in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required
improvements for a period of two (2) years after the date of their acceptance.
G. The approval by the Development Review Board of a Subdivision Plat shall not be
deemed to constitute or be evidence of any acceptance by the City of any street, sidewalk

Section 809 Development Requirements
A. Streets
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 8-11
Article 8 – Edition April 30, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
1. Cul-de-sac: Where through streets are not possible, cul-de-sac streets will be provided
according to the following: a turn-around shall be provided with a minimum right-ofway
radius of 48 feet at the end of all cul-de-sacs.
2. Standards: All streets shall be completely constructed by the subdivider in accordance
with the minimum standards of the State Highway Department for Class 2 or 3
highways as applicable.
3. Layout
a) Arrangement: The arrangement of streets in the Subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of major and secondary streets of adjoining Subdivisions and for
proper projection of major and secondary streets into adjoining properties which
are not yet subdivided, in order to make possible necessary fire protection,
movement of traffic and construction or extension, presently or when later
required, of needed utilities and public services such as sewers, water and
drainage facilities. Where, in the opinion of the Development Review Board,
topographic or other conditions make such continuance undesirable or
impracticable, the above conditions may be modified.
b) Topography: Streets shall be related logically to the topography so as to produce
usable lots, reasonable grades and safe intersections in appropriate relation to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets. Adequate provisions shall
be made to control the drainage of each lot by an adequate storm water system,
subject to the approval of the Development Review Board.
c) Horizontal and Vertical Curves: No horizontal curve shall have a center line
radius of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet. For changes in grade exceeding
one (1) percent, a vertical curve shall be provided ensuring a minimum sight
distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet.
d) Grades: Street crown grades shall be at least one (1) percent to provide
satisfactory drainage. The maximum allowable grade shall be ten (10) percent.
In no case shall a grade greater than seven (7) percent be allowed at or within fifty
(50) feet of an intersection. However, the Development Review Board may
authorize on a cul-de-sac street as a variance, a maximum grade not to exceed ten
(10) percent for a total distance not to exceed nine hundred (900) feet provided
that a grade of not greater than eight (8) percent is established at or within one
hundred fifty (150) feet of an intersection. For grades in excess of eight (8)
percent, the Development Review Board may require safety features as deemed
necessary, such as guard rails and extended shoulders.
e) Intersections: Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible,
and no intersection shall be an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees.
f) Tangents: A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet in length shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all proposed streets.
g) Street Jogs: Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twentyfive
(125) feet shall not be allowed.
4. Access Road: The Development Review Board may require the subdivider to
improve any access road to the Subdivision to the appropriate street standards
provided in these regulations if such access would otherwise be inadequate, provided
that the City owns or provides the right-of-way.
5. Curbs and Sidewalks: Curbs shall be required on both sides of all streets. Sidewalks
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 8-12
Article 8 – Edition April 30, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
on at least one side of all streets shall be required where the density is greater than
one residential unit for each two (2) acres unless waived by the Development Review
Board.
B. Utilities
1. Water and Wastewater: The subdivider shall be required to connect to the public
water and wastewater systems. The subdivider is required to provide such pumping
and other facilities as may be necessary. The subdivider may be required by the City
to provide or to have installed at his expense larger wastewater transmission lines,
pumping stations and/or other facilities.
2. Electric, Telephone, Cable TV: Electric, telephone and cable TV distribution systems
shall be underground including services to residences and to street lights unless
waived by the Development Review Board.
3. Fire Protection Facilities: Fire protection facilities may be required of the subdivider
to the extent such facilities are deemed advisable by the City.
C. Street Lighting may be required as deemed necessary by the City.
D. Street Signs
All street signs and posts shall be provided and installed by the City at the expense of the
subdivider.
A. Storm Drainage
1. Removal of Spring and Surface Water: The subdivider shall be required by the
Development Review Board to carry away by pipe or open ditch, any spring or
surface water that may exist either prior to or as a result of the Subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
2. Drainage Structure to Accommodate Development Upstream: Culverts or other
drainage facilities, in each case, shall be large enough to accommodate 100 year flood
conditions. The Development Review Board shall approve the design and size of
facilities based on anticipated run-off under conditions of total potential development.
The subdivider's engineer shall provide such information as the Development Review
Board deems necessary to determine the adequacy of the facilities.
3. Responsibility for Drainage Downstream: The subdivider shall provide such
information as the City deems necessary to determine the effect of the Subdivision on
the existing drainage facilities.
4. Uninhabitable Land: All land to be used for building purposes on the plat submitted
for approval shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes
without danger to health.
F. Site Preservation
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 8-13
Article 8 – Edition April 30, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
1. Existing Features: Existing features, such as trees, water courses and falls, brooks,
wetlands, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved, insofar as
reasonably possible.
2. Natural Cover: Land shall be subdivided and improved in reasonable conformity to
existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill, and, insofar as
possible, retain the natural contours, limit storm water run-off, and conserve the
natural cover and soil. After application for approval has been submitted, no topsoil,
sand or gravel shall be removed from the Subdivision for any other purposes than to
meet construction needs for that particular Subdivision or to meet any requirements of
these regulations.
3. Erosion and Sediment Control: The smallest practical area of land should be
exposed at any one time during development. When land is exposed during
development, the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time.
Land should not be left exposed during the winter months. Where necessary,
temporary vegetation and/or mulching and structural measures may be required by
the Development Review Board to protect areas exposed during the development.
Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps) shall be installed and
maintained during development to remove sediment from run-off water and from land
undergoing development. Where possible, natural drainage-ways should be utilized
and left open to remove excess surface water. The permanent final vegetation and
structures should be installed as soon as practical in the Subdivision.
G. Excavation and Grading
1. General: All excavating and filling required for construction of improvements shall
be as specified herein. The entire area of work shall be brought to the required lines
and grades by excavation or filling. Excavation material, if suitable, may be used in
making embankments and in filling low areas. A minimum of four (4) inches of
topsoil shall be provided to cover over all finished slopes. This material shall be
spread uniformly over all finished slopes. All streets shall be graded from property
line to property line to approved grade and cross section.
2. Suitable Material Required: No stumps, wood, roots, sod, or other fibrous materials
shall be placed in any embankment. In those locations where the alignment crosses
swamp or marsh land, or other similar soil that is incapable of withstanding expected
loads, such inadequate soil shall be removed entirely and replaced in the
embankment, but may be used in flattening embankment slopes or for filling low
spots outside the road section. The Development Review Board may require the
subdivider to submit evidence of boring and/or other soil investigations to determine
the depth, composition and stability of the subgrade within the road section.
3. Embankments: Embankments shall be formed of suitable and acceptable excavated
materials and brought to the required lines and grades. The materials for
embankment shall be placed in successive horizontal layers not exceeding six (6)
inches in depth extending across the entire fill area.
4. Side slopes: Side slopes in embankment and on roadside drainage ditches shall
descend one (1) foot vertically for at least each two (2) feet horizontally (2 on 1).
Surplus material resulting from excavation of the road prism shall be used to flatten
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 8-14
Article 8 – Edition April 30, 2018 Other articles may have different edition dates.
slopes of embankment so that they ascend one (1) foot vertically for at least two (2)
feet horizontally (2 on 1). Side slopes in excavation rock shall ascend six (6) feet
vertically for at least each one (1) foot horizontally (1 on 6), where rock cuts have a
face higher than ten (10) foot level above the grade at the edge of the pavement. Side
slopes shall not be graded so as to extend beyond the limits of the road right-of-way
onto land not part of the Subdivision unless a suitable slope easement has been
properly established and granted by the affected property owner.
H. Soil Survey
When a development is proposed which, because of its size or location, requires detailed
soil analysis, the Development Review Board shall require the subdivider to request this
analysis from the Soil Conservation Service. The results of investigation by a Soil
Conservation Service soils scientist will be provided by the subdivider to the
Development Review Board along with the other submission requirements of this
regulation.

1. Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have
substantially changed, or
St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 9-4
Article 9 – Edition September 29, 2014 Other articles may have different edition dates.
2. New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been
presented at a previous hearing. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed with the

not extend the period within which an appeal must be taken.
C. Appeals from any decision or act of the Development Review Board in connection with
these regulations shall be made to the Environmental Court as provided for in Section
4471 of the Act.
Section 905.2 Variances
A. The Development Review Board may grant a variance from the provisions of these
regulations following application and public hearing if all the following findings of fact
are specified in its decision:
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is
due to such conditions; and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the zoning regulation in the neighborhood or district in which the property
in located.
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning
regulation and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property;
3. That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
4. The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy
resources, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
5. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least deviation possible from the zoning regulations and the
Comprehensive Municipal Plan.
B. Establishment or expansion of a use not permitted with or without conditions by these
regulations shall not be allowed by variance. Pursuant to Section 4473 of the Act, the
Development Review Board may not amend, alter, invalidate or affect any of these
bylaws or the implementation or enforcement thereof, or allow any use other than those
permitted with or without conditions in the applicable district.

the terms of Section 4424 2(D).
Section 908 Public Notice
Any requirement of public notice required by these regulations, whether or not required by any
provision of the Act, and whether applicable to the Development Review Board, shall be given
not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing by all of the following:
1. Publication of the date, place and purpose of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the municipality;
2. Posting of the same information in three (3) or more public places within the
municipality, including the posting of a notice within view from the public right-of-way
nearest to the property for which the application is being made; and
3. Written notification to the applicant and to owners of all properties adjoining the property
subject to development, without regard to public rights-of-way, which includes a
description of the proposed project, information that clearly informs the recipient where
additional information may be obtained, and that participation in the local proceeding, is
a prerequisite to the right to take any subsequent appeal. Participation shall consist of
offering, through oral or written testimony, evidence of a statement of concern related to
the subject of the proceeding.
No defect in the form or substance of any required public notice under this section shall
invalidate the action of the Development Review Board where reasonable efforts have been
made to provide adequate posting and notice. However, the action shall be invalid when the
defective posting or notice was materially misleading in content. If an action is ruled to be
invalid by the Board of Adjustment/Development Review Board or the Environmental Court, the
action shall be remanded to the Board to provide new posting and notice, hold a new hearing,
and take a new action.
Section 909 Amendments

St. Albans City Land Development Regulations Page 9-6
Article 9 – Edition September 29, 2014 Other articles may have different edition dates.
the original regulations were adopted or by an error in the original regulations.
2. The precedents and the possible effects of such precedents which might likely
result from approval or denial of the petition.
3. The ability of the City or other government agencies to provide any services,
facilities, and/or programs that might be required if the amendment petition were
approved.

Section 910 Interpretations
Except for Section 4413 (c)of the Act and where, in these regulations, specifically provided to
the contrary, it is not intended by these regulations to repeal, annul or in any way to impair any
permits previously adopted or issued.
Where these regulations impose a greater restriction upon use of a structure or land that are
required by any other statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, easement, or agreement, the provisions
of these regulations shall control.
