PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Weslaco, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation that represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and Kyle Meyer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Amanda Elizondo, City Secretary, and Mr. Ramon Vela, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The City's Home Rule Charter is included herein as adopted by the people at a special election held on December 14, 1927. The election was called by Ordinance No. 24, adopted November 1, 1927, and the results were declared by Ordinance No. 26, adopted December 20, 1927. Amendments to the Charter have been added and are indicated by history notes following the amended sections. The original arrangement, numbering system and section catchlines have been retained. In the original, the articles were numbered, but had no headings. These were added by the editor. Additions within the text for clarity have been made in brackets. 
State Law reference- Adoption, amendment, etc., of Home Rule Charter, Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 1165 et seq. 

ARTICLE I. - CORPORATE NAME AND BOUNDARIES; PLATTING OF PROPERTY 

Sec. 1. - Corporate name. 
    All the inhabitants of the City of Weslaco, in Hidalgo County, Texas, as the boundaries and limits of said city are herein established, or may be hereafter established, shall be a body politic, incorporated under, and be known by the name and style of the "City of Weslaco" with such powers, rights and duties as are hereinafter provided, and all other powers not herein specifically designated that are granted by the Constitution and laws of Texas to such cities. 
Sec. 2. - Boundaries. 
(a)  Boundary description: (Omitted) 
(b)  Annexation of additional territory by ordinance. The City of Weslaco, acting by and through its city commission, shall have the power by ordinance to annex additional territory, and bring such territory within the corporate boundaries and subject to the jurisdiction of the City of Weslaco, provided that such ordinance of annexation shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation published in Weslaco, and a public hearing thereon be held at the first regular meeting of the city commission after the second publication thereof; after which public hearing, final action may not be taken by the city commission until its next regular meeting following such public hearing. 
(c)  Annexation of territory within conservation district. Should any territory annexed by the City of Weslaco be within the boundaries of a water control and improvement district, or other legally constituted irrigation district, and subject to a bond tax imposed by such district, then the City of Weslaco shall have power by ordinance to assume current payment of said bond tax to said water district to the extent, but only to the extent, of tax revenues received by the City of Weslaco as a result of taxation of said annexed area, and to continue such current payment of bond tax to said water district until such time as said water district shall release the annexed territory from its boundaries. In exchange for the release of such territory from the boundaries of the water district, the City of Weslaco may assume and agree to pay that proportion of unpaid balance of bonds which applies to the land annexed by the city and released by the water district, providing that the amount of bonded indebtedness thus assumed shall be paid out of revenues received, or to be received from the area thus annexed. The property owners in the area thus annexed, in the event the city allows the bonded indebtedness thus assumed to become delinquent, may pay their tax directly to the water district or bond holders, as the case may be, and deduct the amount thus paid from the tax due the city until such delinquency is cured by the City of Weslaco. The payment of such bond tax by the city shall not be a prerequisite to the collection of the taxes from the area annexed, but is consideration to the water district and bond holders for the release of said land from the water district. The taxes levied by the City of Weslaco upon the area annexed shall be based upon the same considerations as taxes levied upon areas already within the City of Weslaco. 
Editor's note- Section 2(a), as amended at elections held on April 12, 1949, and June 24, 1952, set out the metes and bounds description of the city limits, as they then existed. Since subsequent annexation ordinances have rendered the description obsolete, it has been omitted. 
Editor's note- Subsections (b) and (c) of section 2 above were added by amendment approved at an election held on April 12, 1949, and were readopted, without change, at an election held on June 24, 1952. Subsection (b) was further amended to allow annexation procedures to conclude at the city commission level. Such amendment was approved at a special election held May 6, 1995. 
Sec. 3. - Platting of property. 
    Should any property lying within the city limits, as established by this Charter, be hereafter platted into blocks and lots, the owners of said property shall plat and lay the same off to conform to the streets and alleys abutting the same, and shall file with the mayor a correct map thereof, provided, that in no case shall the City of Weslaco be required to pay for any of said streets or alleys, at whatever date opened, but when opened by reason of the platting of said property, at whatever date platted, they shall become, by such act, the property of the City of Weslaco, for use as public highways and they shall be cared for as such.

    Said city shall have the authority to manufacture its own electricity, gas, or anything else that may be needed or used by it or the public; to make contracts with any persons, firm or corporation for the purchase of gas, water, electricity or any other commodity or article used by it or the public, and to sell same to the public as may be determined by the governing authority.

Sec. 14. - Right to regulate charges, etc., of holder of franchise or privilege. 
    Said city shall have the power to determine, fix or regulate the charges, fares, and rates of any person, firm or corporation exercising, or that may hereafter exercise any right of franchise of public privilege in said city, and to prescribe the kind of service to be furnished, the equipment to be used, the manner of which service shall be rendered and to change such regulations from time to time. That in order to ascertain all the facts necessary for a proper understanding of what is or should be reasonable rate or regulation, the governing authority shall have full power to inspect the books and other records of such person, firm or corporation and compel the attendance of witnesses for such purpose; provided that in adopting such regulations and in fixing and changing such compensations no stock or bonds authorized or issued by any person, firm or corporation exercising such franchise or privilege shall be considered unless proof be made that the same have been actually issued by such person, firm or corporation for money, or its equivalent, paid and used for the development of the property under investigation. 
Sec. 15. - Street powers. 
    The city shall have dominion, control and jurisdiction in, upon, over and under its public streets, squares, avenues, alleys and highways, and to provide for their improvement thereof, upon the initiative of the commission, or upon petition of property owners, as hereinafter provided, by paving, repaving, raising, grading, and draining, and in connection therewith, opening, widening, narrowing, or straightening, and by construction of sidewalks, and curbs or culverts or otherwise. The word "highway" as used herein shall include all streets, alleys, public places, avenues and squares in the city. The city shall have the power to assess not more than three-fourths of the cost of such work, except the cost of intersections and cost to be paid by owners of railroads and street railroads, and except the cost of sidewalks and curbs abutting private property, all the cost of which may be assessed against such abutting property, against the owners of property abutting the highway or section thereof improved, and against said property, and to fix a lien against said property which shall be superior to all other liens and claims, except city, state and county and other taxes, and charge of personal liability against owners of said property. The portion of the cost assessed said owners of abutting property may be made payable in deferred installments, the last maturing of which shall become due not more than five (5) years from the completion of the improvements, and which shall bear interest at the rate of not exceeding eight (8) percent per annum. Said assessments may include reasonable attorney's fees and cost of collection, if incurred, and the commission shall have power to fix the terms of payment, maturity and conditions of said assessments and of the assignable certificates hereinafter provided for. 
    The entire cost of making such improvements between or under the rails, tracks and switches of railroads or street railroads, occupying any highway or intersection improved, and for two feet on the outside of the said tracks, shall be paid by the owners thereof, and secured by a lien assessed on the roadbed, rails, ties and tracks, franchises and other property of said owners, which lien shall be superior to all other liens, claims or interest in or upon said property. The ordinance making such assessment shall provide the time and terms of payment thereof and for the payment of interest, cost and attorney's fees as above set out. 
    No assessment shall be made against owners of abutting property or against railroads or their property, until after a hearing to said owners, and to lien holders or other interested parties before the commission, preceded by reasonable notice thereof, which shall consist of a general notice published not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing in some newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Weslaco. 
    The commission shall have authority to give other additional notice in its discretion, but the published notice shall be sufficient and binding upon lien holders and other interested parties and owners. 
    At said hearing owners and other interested parties shall have the right to contest said assessments, the legality or regularity of any proceeding with reference thereto, or the special benefits arising from said improvement. 
    No assessment shall be made against any owner of abutting property or his property in excess of special benefits thereto in enhanced value thereof arising from said improvements. 
    All protests, contests and objections at said hearing shall be in writing, and the commission shall have power to hear evidence, summon witnesses and take testimony with reference thereto. 
    Said assessments may be enforced, either by suit in any court having jurisdiction, brought by the city for the benefit of the holder and owner of said assessments or the certificates evidencing same, or brought by said owner and holder, or by sale of the property assessed in the same manner, or as near as possible, as is prescribed for sale of real estate for municipal taxes. 
    The lien of the assessments herein mentioned shall relate back and take effect as to all subsequent purchasers and creditors from the date of the ordinance or resolution ordering the improvement. 
    Subsection 1. The city shall have power to cause to be issued in the name and on behalf of the city assignable certificates in writing, declaring the liability of owners and their property for the payment of assessments and to fix the terms and conditions of such certificates. If any such certificate shall recite that the proceedings with reference to making such improvements have been regularly had in compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property and the personal liability of the owner, have been performed, such recitals shall be prima facie evidence of the facts so recited, and no further proof therefor shall be required in any court. 
    Subsection 2. Nothing herein contained shall empower the city to fix a lien by assessment against any property exempt by law from sale under execution, but the owner of such exempt property shall nevertheless be personally liable for the pro rata portion of said cost which shall hereunder be assessed against such property where it not exempt, and such cost shall be assessed against said owner. The fact that any improvement is omitted in front of exempt property shall not invalidate the lien of assessments made against other property. 
    Subsection 3. In apportioning costs of improvements among owners of abutting property, the commission shall act in accordance with the front foot rule, in proportion as the front feet of property of each owner abutting the highway to be improved is to the whole frontage thereof. But if in particular cases the application of this rule would be unequal or unjust, the commission shall adopt such rule as shall effect substantial justice and equality, in view of special benefits received and burdens imposed. 
    Subsection 4. 
    No error, mistake or informality in the ordinance of assessment or in any other step or proceeding prerequisite to said assessment shall invalidate the same, but the commission shall at any time correct the same. 
    No error or mistake in describing any parcel of abutting property or the name of its owner shall invalidate an assessment, but it shall notwithstanding have full force and be in effect against said premises and the real and true owner thereof. 
    Whenever, in the opinion of the commission, any error, mistake or invalidity exists in any proceeding with reference to said improvements or assessments, it shall correct said error, mistake or invalidity and reassess said property and the owners thereof, with reference to which same exists. Such reassessments shall be made after a notice and hearing as herein provided, and not in excess of benefits in enhanced value of the property assessed, and otherwise as near as possible in accordance with the provisions hereof with reference to the original assessments. After such reassessments, the city shall have the power to issue assignable certificates evidencing the same, as hereinbefore provided, which may be payable in deferred installments, the last maturing not over five years from date of said reassessment, and the terms and conditions of said certificates shall as near as possible comply with the preceding provisions hereof having reference thereto. 
    No reassessment shall be made unless proceedings therefor are begun within three (3) years from the date of the original assessments, provided that if the validity of any assessment shall be involved in litigation, the period of time consumed therein shall not be considered in computing said three (3) years. 
    The commission shall have power to adopt rules, regulations and ordinances not inconsistent herewith for the purpose of carrying into effect every part of this section and its subsections and to affect said assessments and reassessments. 
    Subsection 5. 
    Whenever the owners of more than fifty (50) percent of the front feet of property abutting any highway or section thereof which they desire improved, shall petition the commission in writing (which may be one or more separate petitions) and shall state the limits within which the work is to be done, the general description thereof and the materials and methods or alternative materials and methods with which it is desired said improvements shall be made, and the signers of said petition shall agree therein to pay the several amounts which may be assessed against them respectively, under the terms thereof, the said petition shall be filed with the commission, and shall be by it examined and in its discretion approved or disapproved by resolution. 
    The approval of such petition by the commission shall be conclusive of its regularity and validity, and if so approved, the commission shall order the work done as nearly as possible with the materials and in accordance with the methods, or if alternate materials or methods shall be set out in said petition, in accordance with some method and with some material or materials therein specified. 
    When procedure is under this subsection, the commission shall make said improvements and assess and apportion the cost thereof, after notice and hearing as hereinbefore provided, and shall take all steps and do all things with reference thereto in strict accordance with the provisions of this section. Provided that when said work is done pursuant to petition, the city shall pay the whole cost of improvement of intersections of other streets and alleys with the highways named to be improved except the portion thereof assessable against railroads and street railroads so occupying said highway and intersection; such railroads and street railroads shall pay the whole cost of such improvements of said highway or portion thereof between and under their rails and tracks and two (2) feet on the outside thereof, which cost shall be assessed against the owners thereof and their property, and collected in the manner provided in this article. 
    Subsection 6. 
    In any suit brought for the enforcement of an assessment, reassessment or personal liability, the allegation in the pleading or other proceeding that all proceedings with reference to making such improvements have been regularly had in compliance with the law and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien upon the property assessed and the personal liability of the owner, or the issuance of the assignable certificates, have been performed, shall be deemed a sufficient allegation of every proceeding required by law, the city Charter or its ordinance with reference to such improvement or prerequisites to the fixing of such lien or liability and issuance of said certificates, and shall dispense with the necessity of pleading each of said preceding stops or prerequisites specifically, and shall in all courts be taken as if each of said steps, proceedings or prerequisites had been alleged and set out in full. 
    Any property owner against whom or whose property an assessment or reassessment has been made shall have the right within twenty (20) days thereafter to bring suit in any court having jurisdiction to set aside or correct the same or any proceeding with reference thereto, on account of any error or invalidity therein. But thereafter such owner, his heirs, assigns or successors, shall be barred from any such action or any defense of invalidity in such proceedings or assessments or reassessments in any action in which the same may be brought in question. 
    Subsection 7. All contracts for street improvements heretofore entered into by the city and not fully performed and all proceedings had by it in reference thereto, are hereby ratified, confirmed and validated, and all powers heretofore enjoyed by the city whereby it was empowered to provide for the execution of said contracts, and for the assessment of any or portion of the cost of said improvements against owner of property abutting same, and their said property, or against the owners of railroads and street railroads and their said property, and also all powers of the said city for the enforcement of said assessments and collections thereof, are hereby extended and preserved in full force for the purpose of making said assessments and enforcing said existing contracts, and it shall be the duty of said commission to pass all ordinances and resolutions and take all steps necessary or proper fully to execute said contracts or validate or ratify the same and to make and enforce said assessments, and to the issuance of assignable certificates as herein provided; and the commission shall fully exercise said powers to make and enforce said assessments, and to issue said certificates, under and in accordance with terms of this section and its subsections, when adopted. 
    Subsection 8. The city commission of the City of Weslaco shall have the power to name or rename all streets, roads or alleys in the corporate limits of the city, and to designate a number for each house, business building or lot facing any such street, alley or road, and such number and street shall constitute the address of the property to which it is assigned.

    Each signer of a petition shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil, and shall place on the same, following his name, his place of residence by street and number. The signatures of any such petition need not all be attached to the same paper, but to each such paper there shall be attached an affidavit, by the circulator thereof, stating the number of signers to each part of the petition, and that each signature is genuine and that of the person whose name it purports to be, and that it was made in the presence of the affiant. 
    When signatures have been obtained in the number above provided for, and the petition and statement have been filed with the person exercising the duties of city clerk, [city secretary] such officer shall submit all papers pertaining to such ordinance or resolution, and its proposed initiating or reference to the commission at its next regular meeting and such officers shall cause the same to be published in some legal newspaper published in the City of Weslaco, together with a notice of the time of the next regular meeting of the commission, or the date of a special meeting set by such commission for its consideration when such ordinance or resolution and its adoption or repeal shall be considered, which hearing and consideration shall be open to the public, and the public shall be permitted to present arguments for or against such proposed ordinance or resolution.

    After receipt of such certificate and the certified copy of the proposed ordinance or resolution, the person exercising the duties of city clerk [city secretary] shall present such certificate and certified copy of the proposed ordinance or resolution to the commission at its next regular meeting. If any election is to be held at a date not more than ninety (90) days nor less than ten (10) days after such meeting of the commission, then such ordinance or resolution proposed for adoption or repeal shall be submitted by the commission to a vote of the electors at such election to be held, but if no such election is to be held within such time, then the commission shall provide for submitting such proposed ordinance or resolution, for adoption or rejection, to the electors at a special election to be held not less than twenty (20) days nor more than forty (40) days thereafter. 
    The form of ballot for use in an election held for the adoption of any initiated ordinance shall state the title of the ordinance and contain a succinct statement of its nature and purpose and below such statement, on separate lines, there shall be printed the words: FOR THE ORDINANCE ____________ AGAINST THE ORDINANCE.

Sec. 24. - Recall.

    If, in such recall election, there shall as a result of such election, remain one or more such elective officer who is not recalled, then such officer or officers not recalled shall discharge all of the duties incumbent upon the governing authority of the city until the vacancy or vacancies created at such recall elections are filled by an election for that purpose, as hereinafter provided for, but if in any proposed recall election it is proposed and submitted to recall all elective officers then and there, there shall be placed on said ballots under the question of recall, the names of candidates proposed to fill the vacancies proposed to be created by such election, but the names of such officers proposed to be recalled shall not appear on the ballot of candidates. 
    If at any recall election it is not proposed and submitted to recall all of the elective officers, but only one or more, fewer than all, and such election shall result in favor of the recall of one or more of such officers, proposed to recalled, then it shall be the duty of such officer or officers not recalled and constituting the governing authority of the city, within five (5) days after such election is held, to meet, canvass the returns, declare the result of the election and on the same day order an election to fill such vacancy or vacancies which election shall be held not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) days after the same shall have been ordered.

(1)  Each person who becomes an employee of any participating department of the city and who is not already a member of the state municipal retirement system shall become a member of the system as a condition of employment, provided such person is then under 60 years of age; 
(2)  Any member, after one year from the effective date of his membership in the system, shall be eligible for service retirement if he has attained the age of 50 years and has completed 25 years of creditable service with one or more municipalities that have authorized eligibility under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.202 or under section XX of former article 6243h, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes, or if he has attained the age of 60 years and has completed at least ten years of creditable service with one or more municipalities that have authorized eligibility under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.202 or under section XX of said former article 6243h;

(4)  Any person who is an employee of a participating department of the city at the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, but who at the date of his employment was under 60 years of age but did not become a member of the state municipal retirement system because he was then above the maximum age then prescribed by law for initial membership, in the system, shall become a member of the system at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, unless he has already become a member under oath provisions of the governing act, and shall be allowed prior service credit for each month of creditable service performed for the municipality subsequent to the date such person was precluded from membership and prior to the effective date of his membership.

(b)  The rights, credits and benefits hereinabove authorized shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived pursuant to the TMRS Act. 
(Code 1969, § 2-20.2; Ord. No. 84-48, §§ 1-3, 12-18-1984) 
Sec. 2-39. - Additional rights, credits and benefits authorized. 
    Pursuant to the provisions of sections 64.202(f), 64.204, 64.405, 64.406, and 64.410 of subtitle G of title 110B, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended by the 70th Legislature of the State of Texas, Regular Session, which subtitle shall herein be referred to as the "TMRS Act," the city adopts the following provisions affecting participation of its employees in the state municipal retirement system (which retirement system shall herein be referred to as the "system"): 
(1)  Any employee of the city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive retirement annuity, if the member has at least 25 years of credited service in that system performed for one or more municipalities that have participation dates after September 1, 1987, or have adopted a like provision under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.202(f). 
(2)  If a "vested member," as that term is defined in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.202(b), shall die before becoming eligible for service retirement and leaves surviving a lawful spouse whom the member has designated as beneficiary entitled to payment of the member's accumulated contributions in the event of the member's death before retirement, the surviving spouse may by written notice filed with the system elect to leave the accumulated deposits on deposit with the system subject to the terms and conditions of said V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.204(b). If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in such amount as would have been payable had the member lived and retired at that date under a joint and survivor annuity (option 1) payable during the lifetime of the member and continuing thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse. 
(3)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a surviving spouse to whom subsection (a)(2) of this section applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. In the event such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(4)  The rights, credits and benefits hereinabove authorized shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived pursuant to the TMRS Act. 
(5)  Any employee of the city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a standard occupational disability annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.408 or an "optional occupational disability retirement annuity" under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 64.410 upon making application therefor upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of trustees of the system, provided that the system's medical board has certified to said board of trustees: 
a.  That the member is physically or mentally disabled for further performance of the duties of the member's employment; 
b.  That the disability is likely to be permanent; and 
c.  That the member should be retired. 
Any annuity granted under this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of Section 64.409 of the TMRS Act. 
(6)  The provisions relating to the occupational disability program as set forth in subsection (a)(5) of this section are in lieu of the disability program heretofore provided for under V.T.C.A., Government Code §§ 64.301-64.308. 
(Code 1969, § 2-20.3; Ord. No. 88-13, §§ 1, 2, 11-1-1988) 
Sec. 2-40. - Additional rights and credits re probationary period. 
(a)  Any employee of the city who is a member of the state municipal retirement system and who performed service as a probationary employee for the city prior to September 1, 1989, for which the employee did not receive credited service in the system because the person, as a probationary employee was not enrolled as a member of the system during the period of probationary employment, is hereby allowed to obtain prior service credit for the period of such probationary service (not in excess of six months), pursuant to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.303. 
(b)  To obtain prior service credit allowable under subsection (a) of this section any employee entitled thereto shall file a detailed written statement of the service claimed with the city secretary within one year from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(c)  As soon as practicable after the employee has filed a claim the prior service credit under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.303, the city personnel officer shall, if said officer determines that such service was performed as claimed, verify the prior service allowable (not exceeding six months) and the average monthly compensation paid the member during the period of probationary employment, and shall certify to the board of trustees of the system the creditable prior service approved, and the average monthly compensation paid to the person by the city during the period of probationary employment. 
(Code 1969, § 2-20.4; Ord. No. 95-15, §§ 1-4, 6-6-1995) 
Sec. 2-41. - Authorization of restricted service credit. 
(a)  On the terms and conditions set out in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.305, as amended (also referred to as the "TMRS Act"), each member of the state municipal retirement system (hereinafter referred to as the "system") who is now or who hereafter becomes an employee of the city shall receive restricted prior service credit for service previously performed as an employee of any incorporated city or town in the United States or of any council of governments in the state for which the person has not otherwise received credit service in this system, including combined service credit under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 803.001 et seq. The service credit hereby granted may be used only to satisfy length of service requirements for retirement eligibility, has no monetary value in computing the annuity payments allowable to the member, and may not be used in other computations, including computation of updated service credits. 
(b)  A member seeking to establish restricted prior service credit under this section must take the action required under said V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.305 while still an employee of the city. 
(Code 1969, § 2-20.5; Ord. No. 95-17, 9-19-1995) 
Sec. 2-42. - Break in service; reinstatement of previous membership. 
    Pursuant to section 63.003 of subtitle G of title 110B, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, the city hereby elects to allow any member of the state municipal retirement system who is an employee of the city on December, 15, 1992, who has terminated a previous membership in said system by withdrawal of deposits while absent from service, but who has at least 24 months of credited service as an employee of the city since resuming membership to deposit with the system in a lump sum the amount withdrawn, plus a withdrawal charge of five percent of such amount for each year from date of such withdrawal to date of redeposit, and thereupon such member shall be allowed credit for all service to which the member has been entitled at date of termination of the earlier membership, with like effect as if all such service had been rendered as an employee of the city, whether so rendered or not. The city agrees to underwrite and hereby assumes the obligations arising out of the granting of all such credits, and agrees that all such obligations and reserves required to provide such credits shall be charged to the city's account in the municipality accumulation fund. The five percent per annum withdrawal charge paid by the member shall be deposited to the credit of the city's account in said municipality fund; and the deposits of the amount previously withdrawn by the member shall be credited to his individual account in the employees saving fund of the system. 
(Code 1969, § 2-21; Ord. No. 92-25, § 1, 12-15-1992) 
Sec. 2-43. - Additional rights authorized by state law. 
(a)  Any employee of the city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity if the member has at least 20 years of credited service in the system performed for one or more municipalities that have adopted a like provision under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(g). 
(b)  Prior to adopting this section, the city commission has: 
(1)  Prepared an actuarial analysis of member retirement annuities at 20 years of service; and 
(2)  Held a public hearing pursuant to the notice provisions of the Texas Open Meetings Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code § 551.001 et seq. 
(c)  The rights hereinabove shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force pursuant to the TMRS Act. 
(Code 1969, § 2-22; Ord. No. 96-10, § 1, 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 2-44. - Updated service credits. 
(a)  Authorization of updated service credits. 
(1)  On the terms and conditions set out in V.T.C.A., Government Code Title 8, Subtitle G, §§ 853.401 through 853.404, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as the "TMRS Act"), each member of the Texas Municipal Retirement System (hereinafter referred to as the "System") who has current service credit or prior service credit in the System in force and effect on the first day of January of the calendar year preceding such allowance, by reason of service in the employment of the city (hereinafter called the "city") and on such date had at least 36 months of credited service with the system, shall be and is hereby allowed" updated service credit" (as that term is defined in subsection (d) of Section 853.402 of the TMRS Act). 
(2)  On the terms and conditions set out in Section 853.601 of the TMRS Act, any member of the system who is eligible for updated service credits on the basis of service with this city, who has unforfeited credit for prior service and/or current service with another participating municipality or municipalities by reason of previous service, and was a contributing member on the first day of January of the calendar year preceding such allowance shall be credited with updated service credits pursuant to, calculated in accordance with, and subject to adjustment as set forth in said Section 853.601 [of the TMRS Act], both as to the initial grant thereunder and all future grants under this section. 
(3)  The updated service credit hereby allowed and provided for shall be 50 percent of the "base updated service credit" of the member (calculated as provided in subsection (c) of Section 853.402 of the TMRS Act). 
(4)  Each updated service credit allowed hereunder shall replace any updated service credit, prior service credit, special prior service credit, or antecedent service credit previously authorized for part of the same service. 
(5)  In accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of Section 853.401 of the TMRS Act, the deposits required to be made to the system by employees of the several participating departments on account of current service shall be calculated from and after the effective date of this section on the full amount of such person's compensation as an employee of the city. 
(b)  Increase in retirement annuities. 
(1)  On terms and conditions set out in Section 854.203 of the TMRS Act, the city hereby elects to allow and to provide for payment of the increases below stated in monthly benefits payable by the system to retired employees and to beneficiaries of deceased employees of the city under current service annuities and prior service annuities arising from service by such employees to the city. An annuity increased under this section replaces any annuity or increased annuity previously granted to the same person. 
(2)  The amount of the annuity increase under this section is computed as the sum of the prior service and current service annuities on the effective date of retirement of the person on whose service the annuities are based, multiplied by 30 percent of the percentage change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, from December of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the person's retirement to the December that is 13 months before the effective date of this section. 
(3)  An increase in an annuity that was reduced because of an option selection is reducible in the same proportion and in the same manner that the original annuity was reduced. 
(4)  If a computation hereunder does not result in an increase in the amount of an annuity, the amount of the annuity will not be changed hereunder. 
(5)  The amount by which an increase under this section exceeds all previously granted increases to an annuitant is an obligation of the city and of its account in the municipality accumulation fund of the system. 
(c)  City contribution. That effective January 1, 2011 for each month of current service thereafter rendered by each of its employees who are members of the Texas Municipal Retirement System, the city will contribute to the current service annuity reserve of each such member at the time of his or her retirement, a sum that is 100 percent of such member's accumulated deposits for such month of employment; and said sum shall be contributed from the city's account in the municipality accumulation fund. 
(d)  Effective date. Subject to approval by the board of trustees of the system, this section is declared an emergency measure because the money the City of Weslaco is saving by reducing its contribution to the current service annuity reserve of each member is necessary to provide for the usual daily operations of each department and to pay salaries and wages in those departments and become effective on the first day of January, 2011.

ARTICLE VIII. - ELECTRONIC RECORDS MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 2-246. - Applicability of article. 
    This policy applies to e-mail used within the city and e-mail used conjointly with the Internet, and does not supersede any state or federal laws, nor any other government policies regarding confidentiality, information dissemination, or standards of conduct.

(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 1, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-247. - Scope. 
    This article applies to any electronic mail messages created, received, retained, used, or disposed of using the city electronic mail system. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 6, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-248. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Electronic mail message means a record created or received on an electronic mail system including brief notes, more formal or substantive narrative documents, and any attachments which may be transmitted with the message. 
    Electronic mail receipt data means information in electronic mail systems regarding the date and time of receipt of a message, and/or acknowledgement of receipt or access by addressee. 
    Electronic mail system means a computer application used to create, receive, retain and transmit messages and other records. Excluded from this definition are file transfer utilities. 
    Electronic mail transmission data means information in electronic mail systems regarding the identities of sender and addressee, and the date and time messages were sent. 
    Electronic media means all media capable of being read by a computer including computer hard disks, magnetic tapes, optical disks, or similar machine-readable media. 
    Electronic record means the information that is maintained in electronic format in a computer for computer processing and the product of computer processing of that information that satisfies the definition of a government record in the V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 210.003(8). 
    Electronic records system means any information system that produces, manipulates, and stores state records by using a computer. 
    Local government record. 
(1)  The term "local government code" means any document, paper, letter, book, map, photograph, sound or video recording, microfilm, magnetic tape, electronic medium or other information recording medium, regardless of physical form or characteristic and regardless of whether public access to it is open or restricted under the laws of the state, created or received by a local government or any of its officers or employees pursuant to law, including an ordinance, or in the transaction of public business. 
(2)  The term does not include: 
a.  Extra identical copies of documents created only for convenience of reference of research by officers or employees of the local government; 
b.  Note, journals diaries, and similar documents created by an officer or employee of the local government for the officer's or employee's personal convenience;

    Records management officer means the person who administers the records management program established in each local government under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 203.026. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 5, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-249. - General guidelines. 
(a)  Personal use of e-mail. Personal use of e-mail may result in appropriate disciplinary action. Employees need to keep in mind that all e-mail is recorded and stored along with the source and destination. Management has the ability and right to view all employees' e-mail. Recorded e-mail messages are the property of the city and, therefore, the taxpayers of the city. Thus, they are subject to the requirements of the state public information act and the laws applicable to state records retention. Employees should be aware that if they send an e-mail message of a personal nature, there is always the danger of the employees' words being interpreted as official city policy or opinion. 
(b)  Content. If the content of the e-mail contains sensitive or confidential information the employee may use the following message at the end of the message: "This message contains information which may be confidential and privileged. Unless you are the addressee (or authorized to receive for the addressee), you may not use, copy or disclose to anyone the message or any information contained in the message. If you have received the message in error, please advise the sender by reply e-mail and delete the message." 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 2, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-250. - Restrictions. 
    Racist, sexist, threatening, or otherwise objectionable language is strictly prohibited. E-mail should not be used for any personal monetary interests or gain. Employees should not subscribe to mailing lists or mail services. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 3, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-251. - Policy regarding electronic mail management. 
(a)  It is the policy of the city to provide for the efficient, economical and effective management of electronic mail records in accordance with Texas Administrative Code (TAC), chapter 7, sections 7.71-7.79 and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 205.001-205.009 (Local Government Bulletin B, Electronic Records Standards and Procedures). TAC, chapter 7, section 7.72(d), provides that the governing body of a local government or designated records management officer must administer a program for the management of records created, received, maintained, used, or stored on electronic media. 
(b)  The city desires to adopt a policy for that purpose and to prescribe guidelines and procedures for the management of electronic mail consistent with the Electronic Records Standards and Procedures and in the interest of cost-effective and efficient recordkeeping, including long-term records retention. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 4, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-252. - Retention requirements. 
    The city-approved control schedule with the local government records retention schedules provides access to the record series and the retention period for each series. It is the content and function of an e-mail message that determines the retention period for that message. All e-mail sent or received by the city is considered a local government record. Therefore, all e-mail messages must be retained or disposed of according to the city's retention requirements. E-mail generally, but not always, falls into two common record series categories under the Local Schedule GR, 1000-26, Correspondence and Internal Memoranda. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 7, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-253. - User responsibilities. 
    It is the responsibility of the user of the e-mail system, with guidance and training from the records management officer, to manage e-mail messages according to the city's established retention periods. It is the responsibility of the sender of e-mail messages within the city's e-mail system and recipients of messages from outside the government to retain the messages for the approved retention period. Names of sender, recipient, date/time of the message, as well as any attachments must be retained with the message. Except for Listserv mailing services, distribution lists must be able to identify the sender and recipient of the message. User responsibilities may be mitigated by the use of a server level automated classification system. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 8, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-254. - Maintenance of electronic mail. 
    Records created using an e-mail system may be saved for their approved retention period by one of the following: 
(1)  Print message and file in appropriate hard copy file. 
(2)  Place in folders and save on personal network drive or C drive. 
(3)  Save to removable disk, 3.5-inch disks are not recommended for retention periods of more than one year due to the instability of this medium. 
(4)  Transfer to an automated records management software application. 
(5)  Managed at the server by an automated classification system. 
(Ord. No. 2004-11, § 9, 4-6-2004) 
Sec. 2-255. - Disposition of electronic mail. 
    The process for the legal disposition of local government records (including electronic mail) is subject to the same documentation requirements as any other format or medium. This usually requires management permission and some type of disposition log to adequately document disposition and destruction of electronic records. (Local governments are not required to keep a disposition/destruction log, but the practice is strongly advised.) Section 7.78 of the Electronic Records Standards and Procedures (relating to the destruction of electronic records) states that: 
(1)  Electronic records may be destroyed only in accordance with the V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 202.001. 
(2)  Each local government must ensure that:

ARTICLE X. - ACCESS MANAGEMENT POLICY 

Sec. 26-316. - Access to streets and highways. 
    A roadway network consists of several classifications of roadways each with a different traffic mobility function and commensurate inverse level of access to property. Roadway classes with higher levels of mobility function are necessarily designed to lower levels of access function to minimize conflicts associated with slow moving turning vehicles. Roadways are generally classified as freeways, arterials, collectors, and local streets. 
(1)  Freeways are designed to provide the highest level of mobility and to carry the greatest volume of traffic at the highest safe speeds. Accordingly, freeway main lanes provide no direct access to property and access to the freeway main lanes is provided only at interchanges and ramps designed to minimize the disruption of the mobility function. 
(2)  Arterials generally provide mobility across long distances at lower speeds and provide access at lesser arterials or major collector streets. 
(3)  Collectors provide a more even balance between mobility and access and are intended to carry lower volumes of traffic at lower speeds. Since most of the trips on collectors are shorter distance local trips, these streets can safely provide a higher level of access to local streets. 
(4)  Local streets provide the lowest level of mobility and are intended to provide direct access to properties, preserve the neighborhood environment, and enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety. 
(Ord. No. 2007-54, § I(118-26), 11-6-2007) 
Sec. 26-317. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Acceleration lane means a speed-change lane, including lane width tapers, for the purpose of enabling a vehicle to accelerate to a speed compatible with safely merging with through traffic. 
    Access connection means a facility for entry and/or exit such as a driveway, street, or road that connects to the public streets or highways. 
    Commercial means consists of developments including retail, wholesale, office building, warehousing and multi-family buildings consisting of more than five dwelling units. 
    Connection spacing means the distance between connections, which is measured along the edge of the traveled way from the closest edge of pavement of the first access connection to the closest edge of pavement of the second access connection. 
    Directional median opening means an opening in a nontraversable median that accommodates specific movements, such as U-turn movements and/or left-turn movements from the highway, and physically restricts other movements. 
    Divided highway means a highway with a raised median designed to separate traffic moving in opposite directions. 
    Field drive means a limited use driveway for the occasional/infrequent use by equipment used for the purpose of cultivating, planting, and harvesting or maintenance of agricultural land, or by equipment used for ancillary mineral production. 
    Frontage road means a local street or road along an arterial highway allowing control of access and service to adjacent areas and property. A frontage road may also be referred to as a service road. 
    Gross leasable area (GLA) means the area, in square feet, that may be used for leasing space. 
    Industrial consists of establishments for manufacturing, fabrication, industrial, utility, distribution, and transportation uses. These areas may experience heavy truck traffic on a regular basis. 
    Intersection means any at grade connection with a roadway, including two roads or a driveway and a road. 
    Level of service (LOS) means a measure of traffic flow and congestion. It is a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally described in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience, and safety. 
    Limited access roadway means a roadway especially designed for through traffic and to which owners or occupants of abutting land have no right of access. Interstate highways, parkways, and freeways are usually developed as limited access facilities. 
    Local access road means a local public street or road that is generally parallel to a highway for the purpose of serving the collector or local classification function. 
    Marginal access road means the type of street which is used to provide direct access to abutting properties and protection from through traffic. 
    Median means that portion of a divided highway separating the opposing traffic flows. A median may be traversable or nontraversable. 
    Median, nontraversable, means a physical barrier in a roadway or driveway that separates vehicular traffic traveling in opposite directions. Nontraversable medians include physical barriers (such as a concrete barrier, a raised concrete curb and/or island, and a grass or a swale median) that prohibit movement of traffic across the median. 
    Median opening spacing means the allowable spacing between openings in a nontraversable median to allow for crossing the opposing traffic lanes in order to access property or for crossing the median to travel in the opposite direction (U-turn). The distance is measured from centerline to centerline of the openings along the traveled way. 
    Median, traversable, means a median that by its design does not physically discourage vehicles from entering or crossing over it. This may include painted medians. 
    Residential consists of single-family and multi-family buildings consisting of five or fewer dwelling units. 
    Right-of-way means a general term denoting land, property, or interest therein, usually in a strip acquired for or devoted to transportation purposes.

Where conditions are such that vehicular access cannot be provided other than from a thoroughfare, a marginal access street or easement to serve two or more lots may be created with the approval of the director of planning and code enforcement. The marginal access street or easement shall permit entry to the thoroughfare and prevent backing onto the thoroughfare. Marginal access streets or easements shall be included on the subdivision plat.

This provision, however, shall not preclude the addition or deletion of specific programs from a service offering, the addition or deletion of specific channels from an existing tier of service, or the restructuring or division of existing tiers of service that do not result in a fundamental change in the nature of an existing service or tier of service, provided that such change is otherwise consistent with applicable regulations. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment is not an affirmative request for service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or equipment may be made either orally or in writing.

Sec. 34-22. - Subscriber bill itemization. 
(a)  Cable operators may identify as a separate line item of each regular subscriber bill the following: 
(1)  The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee. 
(2)  The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels. 
(3)  The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. In order for a governmental fee or assessment to be separately identified under this section, it must be directly imposed by a governmental body on a transaction between a subscriber and an operator. 
(b)  The charge identified on the subscriber bill as the total charge for cable service should include all fees and costs itemized pursuant to this section.

DIVISION 2. - RATE PROVISIONS 

Sec. 34-48. - Rates for the basic service tier. 
(a)  Basic service tier rates. Basic service tier rates are subject to regulation by the city in order to assure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 47 USC 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this article, not to exceed the initial permitted per channel charge or the subsequent permitted per channel charge as described below, or the equipment charges as specified in section 34-49 will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 34-49. 
(b)  Initial permitted per channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that: 
a.  The city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier; and 
b.  The ordinance from which this article is derived has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, rates in effect on the initial date of regulation or in effect on September 30, 1992, shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
a.  A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or 
b.  The charge specified in subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, as applicable: 
1.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
2.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier. 
3.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing; or 
(2)  The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index ("GNP-PI") published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  Categories. External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of providing public, educational, and governmental access channels as required by the city; 
4.  Retransmission consent fees; and 
5.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or charges in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or 180 days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after 180 days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Code 1969, § 83/4-41; Ord. No. 93-40, § 6, 11-1-1993) 
Sec. 34-49. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service tier. 
(a)  Scope. The equipment regulated under this section consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, and additional connections separate from rates for basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installation under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 34-50. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the hourly service charge ("HSC) methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase cost of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC = EB - CE H  
Where: 
EB = Annual equipment basket cost; 
CE = Annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and 
H = Person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year. 
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours spent annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following formula: 
Monthly Charge = UCE + (HSC × HR) 12  
Where: 
HR = average hours repair per year; and 
UCE = average annual unit cost of remote. 
Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for the rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the foregoing subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customers premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under subsections (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this article. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fee. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city. 
(Code 1969, § 83/4-42; Ord. No. 93-40, § 7, 11-1-1993) 
Sec. 34-50. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the city. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional, or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fees, local taxes, and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated below, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on the direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier and equipment, any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing basic service tier and equipment, and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. 
(h)  Parttime channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a parttime basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Code 1969, § 83/4-43; Ord. No. 93-40, § 8, 11-1-1993) 
Sec. 34-51. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational, and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Code 1969, § 83/4-44; Ord. No. 93-40, § 9, 11-1-1993) 
Sec. 34-52. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the HSC, as defined in section 34-48, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two times in a 12-month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any 12-month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges. 
(f)  For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge.

Sec. 34-80. - City review of basic cable rates and equipment costs. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from the reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission to the city. Provided, however, that the city may toll this 30-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in subsection (d) of this section within 30 days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 34-81 will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city commission meeting held at any time during the initial 30-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to the city manager (the city manager, city secretary, mayor, or cable officer), and must be received prior to the end of the 30-day review period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in sections 34-48 and 34-49, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to sections 34-50 and 34-82, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge as defined in sections 34-48 and 34-49, the city may toll the 30-day deadline in subsection (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this subsection, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or orally during at least one city commission meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days permitted in subsection (d) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the 90-day or 150-day periods, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. Provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the 90-day or 150-day period permitted in subsection (d) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.

Sec. 34-81. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of this article, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  Provided, however, if a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 552, the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Open Records Act, regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for nondisclosure.

(3)  The city's participation is limited to the labor necessary to complete the installation, provided such installation does not require special equipment not available to the city. 
(b)  The service area is defined as the properties fronting the street, 150 feet on each side of the fire hydrant and those properties across the street. In the case of single-family residential districts or other low density districts where fire hydrants are spaced at 600 feet in accordance with the state board of insurance, the service area is 300 feet on either side of the fire hydrant. Rights-of-way are not included as part of the service area. 
(c)  In the event that a developer is installing an off-site fire hydrant at his sole cost, the developer may be eligible to collect a pro rata share of the cost of the installation of the fire hydrant from the affected service area, provided that: 
(1)  The developer submits full disclosure of the cost of the fire hydrant; 
(2)  The city commission approves the request for reimbursement; 
(3)  The city engineer calculates the reimbursement schedule; 
(4)  The collection of the appropriate reimbursement fees from the affected properties at the time that such properties are presented for any type of subdivision or at the time of an application for a building permit; 
(5)  The reimbursement period shall remain effective for ten years from the time of the installation of the fire hydrant is completed. After this time the developer is not entitled to collect any reimbursement fees from the subject improvement. This does not prohibit the developer from collecting reimbursement fees that may have been approved for other improvements; 
(6)  Reimbursement fees are based on actual cost and do not include other interest lost or time value of money. The city shall not be held responsible for the failure to collect reimbursement fees in the event a subdivision is approved or a building permit is issued where a reimbursement fee was due and where the developer did not advise the city within 30 days of the commencement of construction of the development that would include fire hydrants.

ARTICLE VI. - FIRE DEPARTMENT EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT FUND 

Sec. 50-80. - Establishment and funding of fire department equipment replacement fund. 
(a)  A fund is hereby established, to be maintained by the finance department and separately maintained from the other funds of the city, to be designated the fire department equipment replacement fund (the FDER Fund). 
(b)  The FDER fund shall be accounted for as a separate capital projects fund of the city. 
(c)  Contributions may vary from year to year, but shall generally be calculated as 25 percent) of the net collections credited from charges for emergency medical services, and shall be transferred into the fund on a monthly basis. 
(d)  At the option of the city commission, other sources may be used to contribute to the Fund, such as proceeds from capital leases or other surplus funds. 
(e)  Contributions shall be added to such Fund per the above criteria. Notwithstanding, nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that any contribution to the fund is mandatory, but such will be solely at the discretion of the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 2015-26, § 1, 9-15-2015; Ord. No. 2016-03, § 1, 2-2-2016) 
Sec. 50-81. - Expenditures from the fire department equipment replacement fund; prohibited expenditures. 
(a)  The city shall develop a policy to require a complete inventory and periodic measurement of the physical condition of all existing capital assets of the fire department, and then appropriately plan and budget for any capital replacement needs. 
(b)  Withdrawals from the fund require the authorization of the city commission. 
(c)  Withdrawals from the fund should be restricted to: 
(1)  Pay for capital equipment replacements as presented and approved within the fire department equipment replacement budget approved by the city commission for each fiscal year; 
(2)  Make up for a severe shortfall in funds where projected revenues are not met, typically because of unexpected negative influence on revenue stream; 
(3)  Pay for catastrophic repair events of such magnitude that the cost of such would initiate an unplanned tax or rate increase or a greater than planned tax or rate increase (i.e. increases that would not have been needed if such event had not occurred). At the time of any such withdrawal for (2) or (3), a plan to raise taxes and/or rates over a reasonable time period to a level sufficient to cover the ongoing cost of maintenance and operations should be presented to the commission and adopted. 
(d)  Withdrawal from the fund should not be allowed for the following reasons: 
(1)  To make any expenditure not clearly and directly for an approved fire department equipment replacement capital asset.

Chapter 54 - FLOOD HAZARD PREVENTION[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
State Law reference- Local governments must adopt ordinances necessary for jurisdiction to qualify for National Flood Insurance Program, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.3145; political subdivision to comply with federal requirements, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315. 

Sec. 54-1. - Authority. 
    This chapter is adopted under the authority of the constitution and laws of the state. The legislature of the state has in V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.319, delegated the responsibility to the city to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Code 1969, § 131/2-2; Ord. No. 87-13, § 2, 5-5-1987) 
Sec. 54-2. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that the property is in a flood area. 
(Code 1969, § 131/2-3; Ord. No. 87-13, § 3, 5-5-1987) 
Sec. 54-3. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense shall include the future; words in the plural include the singular. The word "shall" is always mandatory while the word "may" is merely discretionary. Those words not expressly prescribed herein are to be construed in accordance with the subdivision regulation ordinance, zoning ordinance, or other applicable ordinance of the city, or in the absence of such ordinances, then in accordance with customary usage in municipal planning and engineering practices. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the urban development department interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base depths from one to three feet. This condition occurs where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Coastal high hazard area means the area subject to high velocity waters, including, but not limited to, hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. The area is designated on a FIRM as zone V1-30, VE, or V. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building: 
(1)  Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zone V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and 
(2)  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. 
In the case of zones A1-40, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zone V1-30, VE, or V, the term "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of elevated building, even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, the water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood hazard boundary-floodway map. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Habitable floor means any floor usable for living purposes; which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a habitable floor. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purpose of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the city's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city. 
    Program deficiency means a defect in the city's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations or of the standards herein. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basements, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
(2)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any projects for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alterations of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance as required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    V zone. See Coastal high hazard area. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 54-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwater; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1969, § 131/2-4; Ord. No. 87-13, § 4, 5-5-1987)

(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the zoning board of adjustments and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (see section 54-2). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Prerequisites for granting variances shall be as follows: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(j)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsections (a) through (i) of this section are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 54-17. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in sections 54-6, 54-13(8), or 54-18(d), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in section 54-14(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting any hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer shall develop and/or review structural design specifications and plans for construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice, as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which shall include the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed within zone A are required to be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with subsection (1) of this section. 
c.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

Sec. 54-19. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-6 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements or residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer and/or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of section 54-14(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zone AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

Such notice shall be given personally to the owner in writing, by letter addressed to the owner at the owner's address as recorded in the appraisal districts records of the appraisal district in which the property is located, or, if personal service cannot be obtained, by publication at least once, by posting the notice on or near the front door of each building on the property to which the violation relates, or by posting the notice on a placard attached to a stake driven in the ground on the property which the violation relates, if the property contains no buildings.

The health officer or his duly authorized representatives shall carefully compile the cost of such work done and improvements made in abating such nuisance, and shall charge the same against the owner of the premises. The city commission hereby finds and declares that general overhead and administrative expense of inspection, locating owner, issuing notice, reinspection and ordering work done, together with all necessary incidents of same, require the reasonable charge of $50.00 for each lot, series of two or more adjacent and contiguous lots, or tract or parcel of acreage, and such minimum charge is hereby established and declared to be an expense of such work and improvement.

After receiving from the department of public works and engineering a compilation of the cost of the work, and after charging the same against the owner of the premises, the director of public health shall certify a statement of such expenses and shall file the same with the county clerk. Upon filing such statement with the county clerk, the city shall have a privileged lien upon the land described therein and upon which the improvements have been made, second only to tax liens and liens for street improvements, to secure the expenditure so made, and ten percent interest on the amount from the date of such payment. For any such expenditures and interest, as aforementioned, a suit may be instituted by the city attorney and recovery and foreclosure had in the name of the municipal corporation of the city; and the statement so made, as aforesaid, or a certified copy thereof, shall be prima facie proof of the amount expended in any such work or improvements. Upon payment of the full charges assessed against any property, pursuant to the procedure set forth herein, the director of public health shall be authorized to execute, for and in behalf of the city, a written release of the lien heretofore mentioned, such written release to be on a form prepared and approved in each case by the legal department.

Sec. 82-96. - Unclaimed property. 
(a)  Responsibility for possession and processing of confiscated property. 
(1)  All property seized by the police department or otherwise acquired by the police department as a result of police department operations and otherwise owned by third parties shall, after initial processing in accordance with the code of criminal procedures of the state by the responsible officer, be turned over to the Custodian for Evidence for safekeeping and disposition according to the terms of this article or as otherwise specified by the code of criminal procedures of the state. 
(2)  The term "unclaimed property," as used in this article, shall mean any such property turned over to the Custodian for Evidence which has not been restored to its owner under the provisions of Vernon's Ann. C.C.P. art. 47.01 et seq., as such provisions presently exists or as may hereafter be amended, and shall have remained unclaimed by its rightful owner for a period of 30 days from the date of acquisition by the city police department or from the date that the property is no longer required to be held by the department for evidentiary purposes or as otherwise required under the code of criminal procedures of the state. 
(b)  Processing owners' claim for property. All persons claiming ownership and desiring the return of property acquired by the police department shall file an application form, which shall be promulgated by the Custodian for Evidence, and present proof of purchase ownership papers with serial number or other sufficient evidence relating to ownership of the claimed property. The Custodian for Evidence shall, after making record thereof, turn over any such claimed property upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence of ownership to the person making such claim. Where any such claim is based upon a general description of the property without other evidence of ownership, the special services division shall record such claim and hold such property for a period of six months, and if no other person shall make a claim for the property, the property will then be released to the original claimant after said six-month period. Should any other party make a claim for property being held during said six-month period, the matter will be referred to the municipal court of the city for an evidentiary hearing, after which the municipal court judge shall make a ruling for the disposition of the property based on such hearing. If any claimant disagrees with the decision of the Custodian for Evidence to hold such property for said six-month period, such claimant shall, within five days of the decision of the Custodian for Evidence, file a written appeal with the chief of police, who shall hold a hearing relating to such appeal and shall have the authority to release such property or affirm the decision of the special services division. 
(c)  Procedures for selling unclaimed property. 
(1)  The Custodian for Evidence shall be responsible for mailing a notice to the last known address of the owner, if known, of any unclaimed property by certified mail. Such notice shall describe the property, shall give the name and address of the officer holding such property, and shall state that if the owner does not claim such property within six months from the date of notice, such property shall be sold, and the proceeds of such sale, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping such property and the costs of the sale, shall be placed in the city general fund. 
(2)  If the owner of such property is unknown or if the address of the owner is unknown, the service bureau shall cause to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city a notice containing the description of the property held, the name of the owner, if known, the name and address of the officer holding such property, and a statement that if the owner does not claim such property within six months from the date of the publication, such property will thereafter be sold, and the proceeds of such sale, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping such property and cost of the sale, will be placed in the city general fund. 
(3)  Any person making a claim for property after notice is provided shall follow the same procedures as provided for in subsection (b) of this section; provided, however, that for property being claimed by general description for which a city six-month holding period has been established, the time period for claims made as a result of this action shall be the lesser of six months or the period between filing the claim and the date of sale, as provided for herein. 
(4)  The sale of any property hereunder shall be preceded by notice published once at least three weeks prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, stating a description of the property, the name of the owner, if known, and the date and place that such sale will occur. If a representative of the purchasing agent shall consider any bid as insufficient, he need not sell such property, but may decline such bid and re-offer such property for sale or otherwise put such property to use or dispose of such property upon written order of the chief of police. 
(5)  The real owner of any property sold shall have the right to file a claim to the proceeds of such sale with the city manager of the city. If a claim is allowed by the city manager, the director of finance shall pay the owner such funds as were paid into the general fund of the city as proceeds of the sale, less costs of holding of the sale and storage. If the claim is denied by the city manager, or if the city manager fails to act upon any such claim within 90 days from the date of claim, the claimant may sue the city in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county, and upon sufficient proof of ownership, cover judgment against the city to recover the proceeds of the sale, as provided in this section. Failure to initiate such suit within six months from the date authorized for the filing of such claim shall be deemed a waiver of any right to cover the proceeds of such sale. 
(d)  Items exempted from this section. The disposition of gambling paraphernalia, prohibited weapons, criminal instruments, explosive weapons, chemical dispensing devices, and other contraband as defined in Vernon's Ann. C.C.P. art. 18.01 et seq. shall be processed, returned or destroyed according to the applicable provisions of Vernon's Ann. C.C.P. art. 18.01 et seq. as such provisions presently exist or may hereinafter be amended, and shall not be subject to the procedures for processing required for unclaimed property as provided for in this article. 
(e)  All other unclaimed, abandoned or personal property. All unclaimed or abandoned property or personal property of every kind, except whiskey, wine and beer, held by the police department after it has complied with this section shall be inventoried and, unless ordered destroyed or returned to the owner, delivered for sale to the city's purchasing agent, who shall hold a sale or auction. After deducting the reasonable expenses of keeping such property and costs of the sale, the proceeds shall then be placed in the city's general fund.

The purchasing agent shall cause a list of such items to be published in a newspaper of general circulation with the notice of the city to hold an auction of these surplus items at a time and place to be designated by the city. The auction shall be held only after the notice of the auction has been printed twice. The auction shall be held no later than ten days after the second published notice of the auction. 
(c)  Auctions. All surplus items will be sold to the highest bidder paying cash on the day of the auction. All surplus items not sold at the auction shall be auctioned at a later time or disposed of by the purchasing agent, at his discretion. 
(d)  Proceeds. All proceeds from said auction shall be delivered by the purchasing agent to the director of finance of the city no later than five days after the date of the auction. All auction proceeds will be deposited into the general fund for the city.

ARTICLE VI. - CURFEW REGULATIONS FOR MINORS[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
State Law reference- Review of curfew every three years, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 370.002; children taken into custody for violation of curfew, V.T.C.A., Vernon's Ann. C.C.P. art. 45.059. 

Sec. 82-156. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article sets forth regulations for the conduct of minors on streets at night. These regulations encompass prevailing community standards for the purpose of furthering the good of minors, of advancing family responsibility and of promoting public safety and welfare. The city commission has determined that the curfew meets a very real need and is a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency. The city commission also finds that commercial recreational facilities are very limited in the city. The curfew hours established by this article reflect the community standard of the appropriate hour for cessation of outdoor activities by minors on the street. The curfew also takes into account the hours which present the highest risk for nocturnal crimes and for the congregating of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity. Therefore, the city commission finds that this article is necessary and that it serves the community's intent in protecting our minors from criminal and other unhealthy influences. The city commission has determined that parental responsibility for the whereabouts of minors is a community norm. As parental control increases, the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases. Therefore, legal sanctions to enforce parental responsibility have shown to be significantly effective in minimizing the incidence of juvenile delinquency. The city commission hereby determines that the curfew for minors will accomplish under local conditions the purposes stated herein. 
(Code 1969, § 18-80; Ord. No. 87-20, § 1, 6-16-1987) 
Sec. 82-157. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Minor means any person under the age of 17 years. 
    Motor vehicle means every mechanical device in, upon, or by which any person or property is to be transported or drawn upon a public highway, including, but not limited to, motorcycles, cars, pickup trucks, tractors, semitrailers, trailers, vans, motor scooters, mopeds, truck tractors and bicycles. 
    Parent means any person having legal custody of a minor as: 
(1)  A natural or adoptive parent; 
(2)  A legal guardian; 
(3)  A person who stands in loco parentis; or 
(4)  A person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including, but not limited to, the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes, such as mere passage or going home. Within this meaning, this article does not prohibit mere presence but is intended to prohibit "remaining." 
    Street means a way or place, of whatever nature, opened to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel, or, in the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the traffic lanes, curbs, sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of the street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what it may be called or informally named, whether alley, avenue, road, roadway, highway or otherwise. 
    Time of night means the prevailing standard of time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city. It shall be prima facie the time then observed in the city administrative offices and police station. 
(Code 1969, § 18-81; Ord. No. 87-20, § 2, 6-16-1987) 
Sec. 82-158. - Curfew hours for minors. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person under 17 years of age to be or remain in or upon the streets within the city at night during the period beginning at 11:00 p.m. and ending at 6:00 a.m., Sunday through Thursday, and beginning at 12:00 midnight and ending at 6:00 a.m., Friday and Saturday. The provisions of this section will also apply to any person under 17 years of age that may be in a motor vehicle, unless exempted under section 82-159(a)(7). 
(Code 1969, § 18-82; Ord. No. 87-20, § 3, 6-16-1987) 
Sec. 82-159. - Defense to accusation of unlawful conduct. 
(a)  It shall be a defense to the accusation of unlawful conduct pursuant to section 82-158 for the accused minor to demonstrate that he was: 
(1)  Accompanied by a parent or the adult spouse of such minor. 
(2)  Accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Prior to engaging in the exercise of such First Amendment rights at a time that would otherwise be in violation of this article, such minor shall first deliver a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of such a minor with their home address and telephone number to the police chief of the city, or to the officer assigned by him on duty, specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night (during hours when the provisions of this article are otherwise applicable to said minor), in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication. 
(4)  Returning home, by a direct route, from a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association of which prior notice, indicating the place and probable time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for immediate reference by, the chief of police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station, thus encouraging (here as in other exceptional situations) conduct on the part of minor involved in such activities a fair balance for the conflicting interest of the minor and the interest of the city in regulating the behavior of such minor. 
(5)  Engaged in nighttime activities organized by the schools and attracting more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual, special permit basis. In such cases, such nighttime activity shall have been organized by or through the schools or other similar organization in a regular course. 
(6)  In possession of a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar month, dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the employer and the chief of police and briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of employment. Possession of said certified card shall be sufficient to exempt such minor from the restrictions of this article, if such minor was, in fact, engaged in or traveling to or from such employment in accordance with the hours as indicated by such certified card. 
(7)  Involved in interstate or intrastate motor vehicle travel, with parental consent. This section specifically exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in the city. This section does not exempt motor vehicle travel merely in or around the city. 
(b)  Each of the foregoing exceptions and the several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are severable as hereinafter provided.

    It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise outside the scope of, this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct of whereabouts of such minor.

Sec. 82-161. - Police procedures. 
(a)  A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of this article, should follow the complete police department juvenile procedures, insofar as those procedures have been approved by the Hidalgo County Juvenile Court(s). In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall, on the first instance, use his best judgment in determining age. In following the police department juvenile procedures, a police officer must act in accordance with the state family code as it is now enacted or may be hereafter amended. In the case of the first violation by a minor, the juvenile officer or other designated police officer shall send to a parent written notice of said violation, certified mail, with a warning that any subsequent violation may result in the enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(b)  The prohibition enacted by this article shall apply only to juveniles as defined by the V.T.C.A., Family Code § 51.01 et seq. If a police officer takes into custody, for violation of this article, a minor who is discovered to be under the age of ten years old, such minor shall not therefor be accused of unlawful conduct pursuant to this article. Instead, the officer is to release such minor to his parent, guardian, custodian or other responsible adult as soon as practicable, pursuant to the police department juvenile procedures. This subsection shall not be construed as a defense to prosecution of the parent of such minor charged with an offense under section 82-160.

    If, after notice pursuant to section 82-161 of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates section 82-160 (in connection with a second violation by said minor), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. Upon conviction for such first parental offense, a parent may be fined in an amount not to exceed $100.00. Upon conviction for a subsequent offense of violation of this article, the parent may be fined in an amount no more than $200.00 for each such subsequent conviction.

In making any such referral, the juvenile officer shall follow the appropriate police department juvenile procedures.

At any time a certificate of occupancy is revoked, the license is automatically void. All mobile home and/or recreational vehicle parks must make annual application for a license in order to operate. 
(b)  Application for original license. Application for the original license shall be in writing signed by the applicant, accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant as to the truth of the application and by the deposit of the license fee required by this section, and shall contain:

Application for transfer of license shall be made within ten calendar days after such notification of change. Within ten calendar days thereafter, the city shall act upon the application for license transfer, and such transfer shall be approved if the park is in compliance with provisions of this article. 
(g)  Violations; notice; suspension of license. Wherever, upon inspection of any mobile home and/or recreational vehicle park, the building official, after consultation with the city officials he deems competent to judge, finds that the conditions or practices exist which are in violation of any provision of this article applicable to such park, he shall give notice in writing and in accordance with section 86-33(a) to the licensee or his agent that unless such conditions or practices are corrected within a reasonable period of time specified in such notice, the license shall be suspended. At the end of such period of time, the building official shall reinspect such park, requesting assistance from other city departments as may be required, and if such conditions or practices have not been corrected, it shall suspend the license and give notice in writing of such suspension to the licensee or his agent. Upon receipt of notice of such suspension, the licensee shall cease operation of such park except as provided in section 86-33. 
(h)  Licenses for preexisting parks; variances based on nonconformities. The owner or operator of each mobile home and/or recreational vehicle park in existence as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall apply for a license under the procedure set forth in section 86-31(b). Such application shall be made within 180 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. The building official, upon receipt of such application, shall inspect the same to determine whether such park conforms to all provisions of this article and all other applicable ordinances and statutes. If nonconformity exists, the building official shall refer said application to the board of adjustment, which shall consider such application and determine whether the failure to make existing parks conform fully to the terms and conditions hereof are due to causes beyond the control of the applicant and whether there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land. If such a finding is made by the board of adjustment, it shall recommend to the city commission that a variance be granted. The city commission shall have the ultimate power to grant or reject the variance upon a receipt of a recommendation from the board of adjustment. Such variance, if granted, shall become a permanent part of the license issued to the owner or operator of such preexisting mobile home and/or recreational vehicle park. The granting of a license with variance, as indicated in this section, does not mean to infer that the degree of noncompliance of a particular variance shall be permitted to be increased beyond the levels as established by the initial granting of said variance. 
(i)  Variances for new parks. The board of adjustment may also recommend to the city commission variance from the terms of this article for parks constructed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived when, in its opinion, undue hardships will result from requiring strict compliance. In recommending a licensing variance, the board of adjustment shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed park, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience, and welfare in the vicinity. No variance can be recommended unless the board of adjustment finds that: 
(1)  A written application for a license has been submitted in advance of making such request for a variance; 
(2)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict applications of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land; 
(3)  The granting of a variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of the legal property rights of the landowner; 
(4)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to the legal rights of other property owners in the area; and 
(5)  The variance request is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article and that the public health, safety and welfare will be secured and substantial justice accomplished. 
Financial hardship alone to the owner or agent shall not constitute undue hardship. The city commission shall have the ultimate power to grant or reject variance upon receipt of a recommendation from the board of adjustment.

The filing of this request for hearing shall operate as a stay of the notice and of the suspension, except in the case of an order issued under subsection (e) of this section. Upon receipt of such petition, the city manager shall forward such petition to the city secretary, who shall request the city commission to set a time and place for such hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and show why such notice should be modified or withdrawn. 
(d)  Hearing order. After such hearing, the city shall issue an order in writing sustaining, modifying or withdrawing the refusal, and such order shall be served as provided in subsection (a) of this section. Upon failure to comply with an order of the city sustaining or modifying the decision thereof, the occupancy permit and the license of the park affected by the orders shall be revoked.

(Ord. No. 2015-12, § II, 5-5-2015) 
Sec. 114-3. - Sign regulation and computations. 
    The following principals shall control the computation of sign area and sign height: 
(1)  Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the base of the sign at the roadbed grade (or the surface grade beneath the sign if not flush with the ground) to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Along elevated Expressway sections, the height shall be measured from the centerline of the main traveled way. In no case shall a free-standing sign height exceed the actual sign setback from any adjacent lot zoned and used for residential purposes. 
(2)  Area. 
a.  Individual signs: The area of a sign face, which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face shall be computed by means of the outside dimensions of the sign and frame. This does not include bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
b.  Multi-faced signs: The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any given point. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that only one face can be seen by approaching traffic at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
c.  Total permitted sign area: The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a premise shall be computed by adding the area of each individual sign. The maximum total sign are per zone lot by zoning district is described is section 114-8. 
d.  Painted signs. Lettering painted on buildings will require a permit and will be counted toward maximum sign area allowed. 
e.  Placement: No sign shall obstruct traffic or violate the sight triangle visibility. No sign with a commercial message shall be placed in the right-of-way without first obtaining a license to encroach. 
Existing multi-tenant and/or retail/shopping centers in commercial zones shall follow the total permitted sign area requirements in section 114-8, except as follows: 
i.  New tenants in a tenant space with no existing signage (from a previous tenant) shall be allowed up to 32.0 square feet of signage on said tenant space but not to exceed ten percent of store front, regardless of the total permitted sign area calculation for the center; and/or 
ii.  New tenants in a tenant space with existing defunct signage shall be allowed to replace said defunct sign with no more sign area than that of the defunct sign, unless an increase would be allowed under the total permitted sign area for the center; and/or 
iii.  New tenants in the anchor tenant space shall be allowed signage under the total permitted sign area calculation for the center, or a no more than a 30-percent increase in sign area on the anchor tenant space from that of the previous anchor tenant, whichever is greater. The latter option (30 percent) shall be allowed on one occasion only (i.e. if the 30-percent option is used by a new anchor tenant, future anchor tenants in the same space may not repeat the option). 
(3)  Lighting Signs may be illuminated subject to the following restrictions: 
a.  Internally and externally illuminated signs shall be permitted in all business, commercial and industrial zoned areas in accordance with section 114-8. 
b.  The illumination of any sign by exposed bulbs or neon shall only be permitted in central business district zoned areas. 
c.  No revolving or rotating beam or beacon of light that simulates any emergency light or traffic device shall be permitted as part of any sign. Flashing devices shall not be permitted upon a sign; however, illuminated signs that indicate customary public information, such as time, date, temperature or other similar information, shall be permitted. 
d.  External lighting, such as floodlights, thin line and goose neck reflectors, are permitted, provided the light source is directed on the face of the sign and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light or glare or other unsafe conditions from being directed into any portion of the traveled roadway. 
e.  The illumination of any sign within 200 feet of a residential lot line shall be diffused or indirect in design to prevent direct rays of light from shining into adjoining residential districts or lots. 
f.  Any extension or power cords used shall not be visible or accessible but secured in rigid conduit or otherwise safely secured as required by the currently adopted city electrical code. 
(4)  Animated. Animated signs shall comply with the following additional regulations and in accordance with section 114-8: 
a.  Animated signs shall be permitted in all business, commercial and industrial zoned areas. Animated signs shall only be permitted in residential zoned areas when the use of the area is for public or private schools, churches and government operated buildings. 
b.  The dwell time, defined as the interval of change between each individual static message, shall be at least ten seconds, and a change of message must be accomplished within two seconds or less. The dwell time shall not include the two seconds or less required to change a message; 
c.  The sign shall contain a default mechanism that will freeze the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs; 
d.  The sign must contain a dimmer control and a photocell, which automatically adjusts the display's intensity according to natural ambient light conditions. In addition, the sign may not display light of such intensity or brilliance to cause glare or otherwise impair the vision of the driver, or results in a nuisance to the driver; 
e.  The sign shall not be configured to resemble a warning or danger signal or cause the driver to mistake the sign for such; 
f.  The sign shall not resemble or simulate any lights or official signage used to control traffic in accordance with the current adopted Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices published by the Federal Highway Administration.

j.  The applicant shall provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light intensity has been factory pre-set not to exceed 7,000 Nits and that the intensity level is protected from end-user manipulations by password-protected software or other method as deemed appropriate by the planning and code enforcement director or designee.

An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on the cause shown. The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, giving public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time.

(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(2)  When a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land will impose upon him practical difficulties or particular hardship, the board may consider and allow variations of the strict application of the terms of this chapter if the variations are in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter, and the board is satisfied, under the evidence heard by it, that a granting of the variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant but will alleviate some demonstrable hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the comprehensive plan created by this chapter. 
(3)  The board may authorize a variance where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property of record at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of property, the strict application of a provisions of this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties and particular hardship upon the owner of the property and amount to a practical confiscation of the property as distinguished from a mere inconvenience to the owner, provided the variation can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan as established by the regulations and provisions contained in this chapter. 
(4)  When, in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will not be substantially or permanently injured, the board of adjustment may, in a specific case, after public notice and hearing and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize special exceptions to the regulations herein established as follows: 
a.  To permit a transitional use between a business or industrial district and a dwelling district where the side of a lot in a one-family district or a two-family district abuts upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes as follows: on a lot in a single-family dwelling district which sides upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes, the board may permit a two-family dwelling.

c.  To grant, in undeveloped sections of the city, temporary and conditional permits for not more than two years. The granting or existence of such temporary or conditional permit shall not be reason or cause for the extension of such permit. 
d.  To permit such modification of yard, open space, lot area or lot width regulations as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a parcel of land if such parcel is separately owned at the time of the passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived or subsequent annexation of the city and is of such restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved without such modification. 
e.  To determine in cases of uncertainty the classification of any use not specifically named in this chapter. 
f.  To grant a permit for the extension of a use, height or area regulation into an adjoining district, where the boundary line of the district divided a lot in a single ownership at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
g.  To permit as an accessory use a parking area for passenger automobiles on a lot or lots in a single-family, duplex, or apartment house district adjoining or across a street of not more than 50 feet in width from an R-1 or R-2 district, subject, however, to the following provisions: 
1.  The area shall be properly enclosed with a hedge screen, fence, wall or other suitable enclosure having a height of not less than three feet or more than six feet. Such fence or enclosure shall conform to the front yard regulations of the district in which it is located.

h.  To permit the reconstruction of a building occupied by a nonconforming use, or to permit the extension of a nonconforming use of a building upon the lot occupied by such use or building at the time of the passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(5)  Any appeal or permit granted by the board of adjustment shall have perpetual approval for the property. 
(f)  In exercising the powers established by this section, the board may, in conformity with the provisions of this section, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
(1)  In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this chapter, the board shall, before making any finding, in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variation will not constitute any change in the district map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, materially increase the congestion in public streets, increase the public danger of fire and safety, materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the city. 
(2)  Every variation granted or denied by the board shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact, based on sworn testimony and evidence, specifying the reason for granting or denying the variation.

In all cases where publication of notice of public hearing in the official publication of the city is required by this chapter and the laws of the state, the applicant shall deposit with the city secretary such sum as may be required to pay the cost of such publication before such publication is made.

(p)  Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision has frontage on or borders an arterial street, the planning and zoning commission may require marginal access streets to be provided on both sides or on the subdivision side of the arterial street; unless the adjacent lots back up to, side up to, or front with extra depth and access off an alley, and provide some other means of restricting individual access directly to the arterial, or unless the planning and zoning commission determines such marginal access streets are not desirable under the facts of a particular case for adequate protection of the lots and separation of through the local traffic. 
(q)  Median islands. Where a subdivision proposes median islands, the following shall be required prior to recording the plat or providing a final approval to the construction of the subdivision: 
(1)  The following plat note shall be required: The maintenance of all median islands shown on this plat shall be the exclusive responsibility of the owner of the property the subject of this plat, his heirs and assigns. 
(2)  The plans (cross-section to be included) and specifications, including a cross-section view, for such median islands shall be reviewed and approved in writing by the city engineer prior to construction where such issues as irrigation lines being encased, overspill appurtenances and illumination shall be considered. In this connection, such median islands shall conform to the amount of pavement required in subsection (m) for the proposed street and made part of this section by reference for all purposes. 
(3)  The city commission, with the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, may set additional requirements to secure the public's health, safety and general welfare. 
(4)  The city engineer shall calculate present removal costs for such median islands, including any paving and utility relocation costs as well as any and all engineering costs that may be incidentally required, and 115 percent of such amount shall be escrowed with the city. Any funds so escrowed and not expended by the city as provided in this section within 15 years from the date of receipt, shall be returned to the then owners of the property, the subject of this plat, on the last day of such period, with the owners of each lot being entitled to an equal share of the refund. All of the owners of the property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be barred. In this connection, the city reserves the right to require evidence satisfactory to it that the persons seeking reimbursement are the owners of the property. 
(r)  Traffic calming. If in the opinion of the city engineer and/or planning director streets in a proposed development are designed as such to encourage vehicular travel at unsafe speeds, the developer will bear the expense to install traffic calming measures. If the streets are existing and a safety problem is perceived the following process will be followed: 
All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a street to be considered eligible for speed hump or other traffic calming device installation. 
(1)  A petition that documents that a minimum of two-thirds of the households in low-density residential dwellings on the street that support its installation. In instances where traffic calming measures will affect other roadways, i.e. (grid network), the requestor will be required to obtain a petition that documents that a minimum of two-thirds of the household along the total affected area are in favor of the traffic calming measures. Petitions will be made available to requestors. Requester will be responsible for distribution and collection of all petitions. 
(2)  The lane uses of the properties abutting the street where the traffic calming measure is proposed must be composed primarily of low-density residential dwelling. 
(3)  Operational characteristics of the street. 
a.  The street must be used to provide access to abutting low-density residential properties (local residential street). 
b.  There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
c.  Traffic volumes must be more than 200 vehicles per day. 
d.  Vehicle speeds must meet the speed criteria. 
e.  The street must have a speed limit of 30 mph as determined in accordance with state law. 
f.  City manager, city engineer, city fire chief, city planning director and city police chief must approve all speed humps or traffic calming measures and their locations. 
g.  The street must not be any of the major roadways shown on the Thoroughfare Plan. The major roadways listed in the Thoroughfare Plan as a collector and greater and/or any other roadway classified by the City of Weslaco and/or TXDOT as a collector and/or greater. 
h.  Paved traveled ways that do not function as a street such as alleys, utility/access easements, parking lot circulation routes, and commercial service drives are not eligible for the installation of traffic calming measures, regardless of any identification signs, due to their operational characteristics. 
(4)  Geometric characteristics of the street. 
a.  The street must have adequate sight distances to safely accommodate the traffic calming measure as determined by the city engineer. 
b.  The street must not have curves or grades that prevent safe placement of the traffic calming measures. Measures may be located on streets that contain curves and/or grades, but the measure itself should not be located within a significant horizontal curve, or on a vertical grade greater than eight percent. 
c.  The street shall be paved. If there are no curbs, a special design must be used to prevent vehicle run-around. 
d.  The street shall have a minimum width of 30 feet and a maximum width of 44 feet. 
e.  The street must have a history that shows the need for traffic calming. 
f.  Private property in the city limits is not governed or controlled by these requirements. 
g.  In the case of areas with grid networks a comprehensive study of all affected roadways will need to be assessed. 
h.  Traffic calming measures are designed to attract the attention of the driver. Therefore, the installation of a traffic calming measure within the limits of a school zone or in areas where pedestrians frequently cross a traveled way increases the chance of pedestrian vehicle conflict. Traffic calming measures shall not be installed in such areas. 
(5)  Cost Responsibility. 
a.  Requestor will be responsible for a $40.00 processing fee and is quantified by individual street segments. If it is so desired by the requestor to study the subject street on a non-typical day the requestor will be responsible for additional $10.00 processing fee. City also reserves the right to conduct an independent study to verify results. The city engineer or designee will make the final determination of study results. 
b.  The cost for the traffic calming measure installation (including signs, pavement markings and, if necessary, special design features such as bollards, curbing or guardrail) may be shared between the city and residents according to how much the measured speed on the street exceeds the speed criteria as defined in this section. This cost sharing is defined as follows: 
COST SHARING 
85th PERCENTILE SPEED RESIDENTS' COST SHARE FOR CONSTRUCTION 
35-36 mph 100% 37-38 mph  67% 39-40 mph  33% > 40 mph   0%  
c.  Allocation of the city's contribution will be made upon a first come first serve basis and constrained by annual funding. 
d.  The term "resident," when used in cost sharing does not necessarily refer to the petitioners. It is used to define the share of the cost that is not the responsibility of the city and could be paid by one or more of the residents or from other private sources. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing cost-sharing table, residents may be able to expedite calming measure installation by voluntarily paying the full installation cost. 
(6)  Traffic calming measure alteration and removal. The process for traffic calming measure removal or alteration by residents will require a petition that documents that a minimum of two-thirds of adjacent property owners on the street support its removal. There is not city participation in cost sharing for the removal of the traffic calming measure. The city manager has the right to remove a traffic calming measure if it is deemed necessary. 
(s)  Private street policy. 
(1)  A written variance shall be provided requesting that lots are desired to be developed which will not front a public street, and the rationale for such variance for private street(s). If there is a stubbed street, or streets, onto the undeveloped acreage desired to be developed with a private street(s), the likelihood is that there will be no privatization due to pre-designed neighborhood-to-neighborhood linkage. 
(2)  Include within parenthesis under the proposed subdivision plat's name: ("PRIVATE SUBDIVISION"). 
(3)  The developer's dedicatory language on the plat shall read as follows: "I, the undersigned, owner of the land shown on this plat, and designated as (the name of the subdivision), do hereby grant an easement to the City of Weslaco and those who may now or hereafter hold franchise under said city, the use of the streets, alleys, and easements thereon shown, surface use of the streets and alleys is restricted to the employees or agents of the City of Weslaco, employees of utilities operating under franchise to the City of Weslaco, residents of the subdivision, and their guests." 
(4)  If not legally existing, a homeowner's association (HOA) shall be established/recorded to maximize the maintenance of common areas which shall include the private street(s), its storm drainage, street lighting, accompanying sidewalks, plus any other private improvements within the private street area. 
(5)  The private street(s) shall be identified as "common areas" and given lettering for said private property such as "Common Area Lot A". 
(6)  Plat notes shall be required on the plat to be as follows: 
Plat note: All private streets, inclusive of median islands and any sentry shelters, plus any accompanying storm drainage, street lighting, and/or sidewalks, shall be privately maintained by the homeowner's association. Also, all perimeter walls and fences shall be under the ownership and the exclusive responsibility of the homeowner's association for the purposes of enclosed privacy, security, and repair. 
Plat note: After the recording of the plat's conditions, covenants, and restrictions (CCRs) to thus assure maintenance of common areas and median islands, etc., a building permit application may be filed with the City of Weslaco for any proposed gated entry mechanisms whereafter it shall be reviewed for approval or disapproval by the city including the fire marshal's office. In no case shall gate(s) be installed where a building permit has not been issued. 
Plat note: The homeowner's association and/or every lot owner shall hold the City of Weslaco, Texas, harmless and indemnify said city from any and all liability and alleged claims relating to said private streets. The lot owners shall be responsible for the costs to maintain the private streets, accompanying storm drainage, private sidewalks, private street lighting, and any other private improvement in the private street area. 
Plat note: The owner(s)/developer(s) shall sign and record an indemnification agreement holding harmless the City of Weslaco and indemnifying it from all obligations to maintain said streets and from any liability arising out of or incident to such streets. 
(7)  The developer shall sign and record a private street agreement on a form established by the City of Weslaco after consultation with the city attorney. 
(8)  Should there be an existing subdivision with public streets but where there is a desire to propose a gated entry thus privatizing the street(s), the following minimum policies shall apply and be fully complied with: 
a.  No collector, arterial, or other street providing "through traffic" shall be considered for privatization. 
b.  A written petition reflecting 100 percent of the lot owners desiring the private street and subsequent gated entry shall be provided to the city. Renters or tenants shall not be deemed "lot owners." 
c.  A homeowner's association (HOA) must be evident or shall be legally established providing for the maintenance and upkeep of the streets, street lighting, sidewalks, storm drainage improvements, and other improvements that may be deemed "common elements" that would normally be the City of Weslaco's responsibility to maintain and upkeep. 
d.  Once the above is evident, then a written petition (deemed to be the written variance request) "to have lots not front a public street" shall be provided to the Weslaco Planning Department to review for eligibility and pre-meeting consideration. 
e.  Once eligibility is confirmed, and the public works, fire marshal, PD, and other city departments have assessed the proposal, the planning department shall cause the variance request for "private streets" to be considered by the planning and zoning commission, and the city commission as with any other variance to the subdivision code. The forums shall be public hearings with mailed notices to all owners of the subdivision; the cost shall be identical to the rezoning fee. 
f.  If the variance is approved, a private street agreement on a form established by the City of Weslaco, shall be signed and recorded by the applicant HOA's board of directors. 
g.  Once the street privatization variance is approved by the city commission, the City of Weslaco and the applicant HOA shall coordinate within 30 calendar days, the transition of street lighting costs from a public account to a private HOA account. 
h.  The HOA shall pay for any traffic signage and markings indicating that the street is now "private." 
i.  Any desired gate to secure the private street shall first obtain a building permit prior to any installation. 
(9)  Should there be a petition from an existing subdivision with private streets but where there is a desire to dedicate the street(s) to the public the following minimum policies shall apply and be fully complied with: 
a.  A written request signed by the duly authorized homeowners association (HOA) officers and submitted to the city commission requesting dedication of the private streets to the public; 
b.  The written request by the HOA officers will be accompanied by a petition containing the signatures of the owners of 100 percent of the existing lots in the subdivision, unless the city commission determines it is in the public interest to accept the streets; 
c.  The streets must meet city standards as determined by the city engineer and the city commission agrees to accept the streets; 
d.  All repairs or reconstruction of private streets to city standards must be accepted by the city prior to conversion. All conversion dedication costs will be paid by the HOA; and 
e.  All gates and appurtenances thereto must be removed at the expense of the HOA.

No subdivision will be approved unless calculations submitted by the project engineer show that the projected runoff for the proposed subdivision, based on a twenty-five-year flood event, will not be greater than the natural runoff. Any water in excess of natural runoff must be detained on-site and released at existing ten-year flood rate. These flows may be exceeded only if off-site improvements and/or facilities are provided which, in the opinion of the city engineer and the planning and zoning commission, serve as adequate drainage facilities. Any property must provide an amount of floodwater storage capacity after development, which is not less than the preexisting floodwater storage capacity of such property during the 100-year flood, regardless of whether such preexisting flood storage capacity is due to natural or artificial causes. The project engineer shall provide such information as required by the city to demonstrate compliance with the city drainage policy. 
Twenty-five-year flood detention is required for all developments except for two cases: 
i.  Small projects. The table below identifies small projects. 
SMALL PROJECT EXCEPTION DESCRIPTION 
1. Construction of a building or parking lot if the proposed construction does not require a variance from a water quality regulation, does not exceed 5,000 square feet of impervious cover and the construction site does not exceed 10,000 square feet (includes construction, clearing, grading, construction equipment access, driveway reconstruction, temporary installations, landscaping and other areas planning director or city engineer determine part of construction site). 2. Construction of a storm sewer not more than 30 inches in diameter that is entirely on public right-of-way or easement. 3. Construction of a utility line not more than 8 inches in diameter that is entirely in public right-of-way. 4. Construction of a left turn lane on a divided arterial street. 5. Construction of street intersection improvements. 6. Widening of public street to provide a deceleration lane if additional right-of-way is not required. 7. Depositing less than two feet of earth fill, if site is not in the 100 year floodplain and the fill is not to be deposited within the dripline of a protected tree. 8. Minor development that the planning director and/or city engineer determine similar to items described above.  
ii.  Storm water quality. In an attempt to help reduce the amount of pollutant being discharged into the Arroyo Colorado Watershed, city will consider reducing the amount of storm water detention, if low impact development techniques are used to hold storm runoff. There are many practices that have been used to adhere to these principles such as bioretention facilities, rain gardens, vegetated rooftops, rain barrels, and permeable pavements. City engineer must approve these techniques and quantities before storm detention requirement is reduced. 
(d)  Existing facilities. Facilities currently discharging storm water to streets without detention will be required to detain storm water run-off if a building permit is requested, if the building does not meet small project exception. The minimum detention requirements shall be based on the building being constructed or remodeled. The storm water run-off may be detained in the landscaped area. 
(e)  Lot grading: All lots shall be graded so that storm water run-off is directed to the street fronting the lot. If a lot has double frontage, the city engineer and/or planning director may allow for the drainage of the lot to be split such that a portion of the run-off is directed to the street in front of the lot with the remainder of the run-off directed to the street at the rear of the lot. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 26-35. - Blocks. 
    Block length shall not exceed 1,300 feet or provide access to more than 50 dwelling units except along major and minor thoroughfares. 
    A residential block that exceeds 900 feet in length must be transected by a pedestrian path that is located not less than 300 feet from each block end. The pedestrian path shall not be less than five feet wide, comply with city standards for a sidewalk or trail, and be located within an easement or right of way, as determined by the planning director, not less than fifteen feet wide. The director may waive or modify this requirement if he determines that the path cannot meet ADA requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 26-36. - Crosswalks. 
    Crosswalk rights-of-way six feet in width shall be dedicated to the public where deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission to provide pedestrian circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and transportation and other community facilities, or to provide pedestrian circulation with the subdivision. Crosswalks shall be provided with a concrete sidewalk at least five feet wide. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 26-37. - Park dedication of fees in lieu of requirements. 
(1)  This section is adopted to provide recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of subdivision development in the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, as defined under this appendix. This section is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city granted under the state constitution, and the state statutes including, but not by way of limitation, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 51.071 et seq., 212.003, 212.0045, 212.0115, 212,018. It is hereby declared by the city commission that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into a procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the city and its ETJ, whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on existing property for increased residential use. 
(2)  Neighborhood parks are those parks providing a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of residences to be served thereby. The primary cost of neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, the following requirements are adopted to the purpose stated: 
(b)  General requirements. R-1, R-2, R-3, M-1, PUD land shall be used for single-family, large lot single-family, townhouse, duplex, multifamily, mobile home and modular home, high-density manufactured housing development, planned unit development, and/or other ETJ residential purposes. 
(1)  Whenever a final plat is filed of record with the county clerk for development of a residential area in accordance with the planning and zoning ordinances of the city, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of an area of land to the city for park purposes, which area shall equal one acre for each 125 proposed dwelling units. Any proposed plat submitted to the city for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section. The required dedication of this section may be met by money in lieu of land or by prior donation of public park land when permitted or required by other provisions of this section. 
(2)  The city commission declares that development of an area smaller than one acre for public park purposes is impractical. Therefore, if fewer than 125 units are proposed by a plat filed for approval, the landowner shall be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount provided by subsection (d)(3) of this section, rather than to dedicate any land area. No plat showing a dedication of less than one acre shall be approved. 
(3)  In instances where an area of more than one acre of park land is to be dedicated, the city shall have the right to accept the land dedication for approval of the final plat, or to refuse the same, after consideration of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board, and to require payment of cash in lieu of land in the amount provided by subsection (d)(3) of this section, if the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential for that park zone would be better served by expanding or improving existing parks. 
(4)  The dedication required by this section shall be made upon filing of the final plat or contemporaneously by separate instrument, unless additional dedication is required subsequent to the filing of the final plat as follows. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceed the figure upon which the original dedication was based, such additional dedication shall be made by the current landowner by payment of cash in lieu of land in the amount provided by subsection (d)(3) of this section, or by the conveyance of an entire numbered lot adjoining the dedicated park site to the city. 
(c)  Prior dedication/donation. At the discretion of the city, any former gift of land to the city may be credited on a per-acre basis toward eventual land dedication requirements imposed on the donor of such lands. The city commission shall consider the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board in exercising its discretion under this subsection. 
(d)  Money in lieu of land. 
(1)  Subject to approval of the city commission, a landowner responsible for dedication of land under this section, where such property is within the city limits or within the defined ETJ, may elect to meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, in whole or in part, by a cash payment in lieu of land, in the amount set forth by subsection (d)(3) of this section. With the city commission approval, such payment in lieu of land may be either made prior to the time of the final plat's recording or prior to the issuance of a building permit by the city. 
(2)  The city may from time to time decide to purchase land for parks in or near areas of actual or potential development. If the city does purchase park land, the city shall have the right to require payment of cash in lieu of land in the amount set forth in subsection (d)(3) of this section for all subsequent residential development near the subject park, provided that the fees assessed do not exceed the city's actual cost of acquisition and development of the park and the city's actual cost of the provision of adjacent streets and utilities, if applicable. Once the city has been reimbursed entirely for all such costs for that park, this section shall cease to apply, and the other sections of this section shall again be applicable. 
(3)  To the extent that other sections of this section require, the dedication requirement shall be met by a payment in lieu of land set from time to time by ordinance of the city commission, sufficient to acquire and develop land and to provide adjacent streets and utilities for a neighborhood park to serve the area in which such development is located. Unless changed by the city commission, such price shall be computed on the basis of: 
a.  $400.00 per-lot for R-1, R-3 and M-1 districts and; 
b.  $250.00 per-dwelling unit for any apartment or multi-family use 
Cash payments may be only used for the acquisition, development or improvement of a neighborhood park, bicycle trails, and/or streets and utilities adjacent to the neighborhood park. 
(e)  Special fund; right to refund. 
(1)  There is hereby established a trust and agency account for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section, which fund shall be known as the park land dedication account. 
(2)  The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section with reference to individual plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within five years from the date received by the city for the acquisition, development or improvement of a neighborhood park, bicycle trails, or adjacent streets and utilities necessary for the park. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first-in, first-out basis. If not so expended, the owners of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rate refund of such sum, computed on the same basis as is called for in subsection (d)(2) of this section. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be barred. 
(f)  Additional requirements; definitions. 
(1)  Any land dedicated to the city under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses. The following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable: 
a.  Any area primarily located in the 100-year floodplain; 
b.  Any areas of unusual topography, slope or shape which renders the same unsuitable for organized recreational activities. 
Such characteristics of a park land dedication site may be grounds for refusal of any preliminary plat. 
(2)  Drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the drainage is constructed in accordance with city engineering standards and if no significant area of the park is cut off from access or rendered unusable by such drainage area. 
(3)  Each park must have ready access to a public street. 
(4)  Unless provided otherwise in this section, an action of the city shall be by the city commission, after consideration of the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board. Any proposal shall be reviewed by the parks and recreation board and a recommendation forwarded to the planning and zoning commission. The commission shall consider the proposal coming under this section and make its recommendation. Both the parks and recreation board and the planning and zoning commission recommendations shall be given to the city commission. The matter shall then be referred to the city commission for its decision. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013; Ord. No. 2016-07, §§ I, II, 3-1-2016) 
Sec. 26-38. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Sidewalks shall be installed along the perimeter streets of the subdivision at the developers expense, and shall be so installed in the following manner: 
(1)  All sidewalks shall be not less than five feet in width and of concrete, stone or masonry construction. 
(2)  Sidewalks shall be as nearly parallel to the street as possible. 
(3)  Sidewalks shall be placed in accordance with the city's construction standards manual and meet all ADA requirements. 
(4)  In lieu of construction, cash or its equivalent may be deposited with the city in a sum equal to the actual cost of construction, plus any engineering costs that might be required, as an alternative to the mandatory construction of sidewalks. Such funds will be set aside by the city for the installation, as the need arises. 
(5)  Additional sidewalks may be provided as deemed necessary and in the interest of the city upon consideration by the planning and zoning commission in commercial, industrial, public and multifamily areas; and such additional sidewalks as the property owner may desire shall be permitted. 
(6)  If such sidewalks are not installed prior to the issuance of a building permit on a lot requiring a sidewalk, the owner shall construct the same or may elect the other alternative described in section (4) of this section. 
(b)  Sidewalks shall be installed in front of lots by the property owner at the time of building construction. On corner lots, the owner shall be responsible for the sidewalk along all streets adjoining the lot. Sidewalks shall be installed in the following manner: 
(1)  Sidewalks in residential areas shall be four feet in width and of concrete, stone, or masonry construction. 
(2)  Sidewalks in multi-family/commercial or industrial area shall be five feet in width and of concrete, stone or masonry construction. 
(3)  Sidewalks in residential zones shall be constructed a minimum of four feet from the back of curb, unless otherwise approved by the planning director or city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 26-39. - Streetlights. 
(a)  Location. Streetlights shall be installed at the cost of the subdivider at all intersections, at the end of culs-de-sac, and at such other locations as deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission within the proposed subdivision and those adjacent subdivisions. 
(b)  Major thoroughfares/arterials. On streets classified as major thoroughfares or arterial streets, the streetlight shall be a minimum 27,500 lumen sodium vapor or approved equivalent, and be spaced no more than 250 feet between streetlights. 
(c)  Collector streets. On streets classified as collector streets, the streetlights shall be 27,500 lumens sodium vapor and be spaced no more than 300 feet between streetlights. 
(d)  Minor residential streets. On streets classified as minor residential streets, the developer will have one of two options on streetlights: 
(1)  Install 27,500 lumens sodium vapor streetlights to be spaced not more than 400 feet between streetlights; or 
(2)  Install 16,000 lumens streetlights to be spaced not more than 200 feet between streetlights. 
(e)  Private streetlights maintenance. It is recommended that streetlights on private streets are installed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Being nonpublic streets, the monthly streetlights costs are not borne by the city nor the maintenance costs involved thereof. Prior to any private streets being accepted as dedicated streets, streetlights located therein may be caused by the city to be upgraded, new streetlights spaced appropriately, or cause other improvements to be done. In regard to private streetlights on public streets, such as in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, where maintenance is not accepted by the jurisdiction power company, the city commission, with the advice and recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, may approve the monthly costs of the streetlights but shall not, under any circumstances, accept the maintenance costs involved. Such maintenance costs shall be borne as a proper obligation by the owner and/or homeowner's association. 
(f)  Existing streetlights. During the platting review and approval process where streetlights are existing, the subject streetlights must be upgraded to the appropriate luminaire level reflective of the public street's classification. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 26-40. - Buffer fencing. 
    In developments within the city limits and the ETJ, a minimum six-foot buffer fence shall be required along any natural and/or manmade hazard such as an open canal, open ditch, caliche pit, and holding pond which, in the opinion of the city, is necessary for the lot's occupants to be protected from. In the ETJ, a plat note requiring such buffering of the affected lot owner at the time of the lot's occupancy shall be provided. Removal or damage to these fences will subject the owner of the lot adjacent to the buffer fence to fines and/or replacement/repair of the fence at the owner's expense or the person causing this damage. Such buffering may also include major thoroughfares but not golf course lakes, and/or similar landscaping. 
(Ord. No. 2013-22, § II, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 26-41. - Subdivision improvement inspections. 
    All subdivision improvements will be inspected by the city engineer or his designee for conformance to city specifications. All construction materials and compaction of roadways and utility trenches will be tested by a geotechnical engineering laboratory of the city's choice. In order to recover the expenses related to the aforementioned inspections, the city will charge a fee of five percent of the approved construction cost estimate. Two percent will cover the cost of inspections by city personnel. Three per cent will be placed into escrow account to cover the cost incurred by the city for the services provided by the Geotechnical Engineering Laboratory. Any costs that exceed the three per cent will be the responsibility of the developer and must be reimbursed to the city prior to the recordation of the plat.

(d)  Reimbursement fees are to be collected by the city from the property in the service area at the time of subdivision approval of such properties or at the time of permit application for construction in the properties in the service area. 
(e)  The city will disburse such reimbursement fees collected to the developer in the same percentage as construction contribution by the developer of subject utilities. 
(f)  The reimbursement schedule shall be based on actual construction cost to be submitted to the city engineer. 
(g)  The developer shall be eligible to receive reimbursement fee for a period of ten (10) years from the time of completion of subject utilities. 
(h)  The city shall notify the developer when a subdivision is approved or when a building permit is issued if reimbursement fees are due and the city shall not be held responsible for failure to collect reimbursement fees from the properties where reimbursement fees were due unless the developer gives notice in writing to the city of such requirements within thirty (30) days of the commencement of construction of utilities. 
(B)  The cost to property owners where utilities are made available by the extension: 
(1)  A pro rata charge shall be assessed to each property where utilities are made available. The charge will be made according to the terms of the attached Schedule I. 
Editor's note- Schedule I is not set out at length herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the offices of the city secretary and the engineering department. 
(2)  The city may connect any future customer reasonably served from the utility extension, provided the customer has paid the pro rata charge and tapping fee. 
(3)  Any customer not contributing the pro rata charge at the time of installation of the utility extension who requests service at a later date, must pay the pro rata charge in full plus an additional fifteen percent (15%), plus the tapping fee before service will be installed. The fifteen percent (15%) surcharge will be retained by the city to defray the cost of bookkeeping for the utility extension and will be excluded from the computations for refunds. 
(4)  Any condition not covered by these regulations or of such a nature that would result in an inequitable pro rata charge to any customer, will be negotiated by the city commission at the time of installation of a proposed line extension.

(i)  The letter of credit must be 110% collateralized by an investment instrument that would meet the qualifications for a City investment; and 
(ii)  The investment instrument must be registered in the city's name and the city must receive safekeeping receipts for all collateral before the letter of credit is accepted. 
(3)  The letter of credit shall list as sole beneficiary the Mayor of the city, in his official capacity, or the Mayor's successor in office, and must be approved by the city commission. The form of the letter of credit shall be modeled after the form attached in Appendix 2B. Figure: 31 TAC § 364.54(c)(3). 
(4)  The letter of credit shall be conditioned upon installation or construction of water and wastewater facilities meeting the criteria established under Division 2 of this subchapter and upon construction of facilities within the time stated on the plat, or on the document attached to the plat for the subdivision, or within any extension of time granted by the commissioners court. 
(d)  Financial guarantee. The city will determine the amount of the bond, letter of credit, or cash deposit required to ensure proper construction of adequate water and wastewater facilities in the subdivision. 
(e)  Alternative to city accepting a financial guarantee. The city may approve a final plat under this section without receiving a financial guarantee in the name of the city if: 
(1)  The property being subdivided lies wholly within the jurisdiction of the city; 
(2)  The property being subdivided lies wholly within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality; and 
(3)  The municipality has executed an inter-local agreement with the county that imposes the obligation on the municipality to: 
(a)  Accept the bonds, letters of credit, or other financial guarantees, that meet the requirements of this section; 
(b)  Execute the construction agreement with the subdivider; and 
(c)  Assume the obligations to enforce the terms of the financial guarantee under the conditions set forth therein and complete construction of the facilities identified in the construction agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2005-46, § II(3.4), 11-1-2005) 
Section 3.5. - Review and approval of final plats. 
(a)  Scope of review. The city will review the final plat to determine whether it meets the standards of Division 2 and the requirements of Division 3 of this subchapter. 
(b)  Disapproval authority. The commissioners court shall refuse to approve a plat if it does not meet the requirements prescribed by or under these rules. 
(c)  Prerequisites to approval. Final plat approval shall not be granted unless the subdivider has accomplished the following: 
(1)  Dedicated the sites for the adequate water and sewerage facilities identified in the final plat to the appropriate retail public utility responsible for operation and maintenance of the facilities; and 
(2)  Provided evidence that the water facilities and sewerage facilities have been constructed and installed in accordance with the criteria established within these rules and the approvals from the commission of the plans and specifications for such construction, including any change orders filed with these agencies; or 
(3)  Obtained all necessary permits for the proposed water facilities and sewerage facilities (other than for OSSF permits on individual lots within the proposed subdivision) and has entered into a financial agreement with the city secured by a bond or other alternative financial guarantee such as a cash deposit or letter of credit for the provision of water and sewerage facilities with the bond or financial guarantee meeting the criteria established in Division 3 of this subchapter. 
(Ord. No. 2005-46, § II(3.5), 11-1-2005) 
Section 3.6. - Time Extensions for Providing Facilities. 
(a)  Reasonableness. The commissioners court may extend, beyond the date specified on the plat or on the document attached to the plat, the date by which the required water and sewer service facilities must be fully operable if: 
(1)  Any financial guarantees provided with the final plat as originally submitted are effective for the time of the requested extension or new financial guarantees that comply with § 364.54 are submitted which will be effective for the period of the extension; and 
(2)  The court finds the extension is reasonable and not contrary to the public interest. 
(b)  Timeliness. If the facilities are fully operable before the expiration of the extension period, the facilities are considered to have been made fully operable in a timely manner. 
(c)  Unreasonableness. An extension is not reasonable if it would allow a residence in the subdivision to be inhabited without water or sewer services that meet the standards of Division 2 of this subchapter. 
(Ord. No. 2005-46, § II(3.6), 11-1-2005) 
Section 3.7. - Criteria for Subdivisions that Occurred Prior to September 1, 1989. 
(a)  Authority and scope. This section shall apply only to tracts of land that were divided into two or more parts to lay out a subdivision before September 1, 1989 and have not been platted or recorded. This section is in addition to the authority of the city to grant a delay or variance pursuant to Local Government Code § 232.043 [V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 2323.043] or a rule of the city adopted pursuant to such provision. 
(b)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health of the city residents, to ensure that adequate water and sewerage facilities are provided in subdivisions within the jurisdiction of this City, and to establish the minimum standards for pre-1989 subdivisions for which no plat has been filed or recorded in the records of the county. 
(c)  Required plat. In the event that the owner of tract of land located outside the limits of a municipality who subdivided the tract into two or more parts to lay out a subdivision of the tract prior to September 1, 1989, including an addition, or to lay out suburban lots or building lots, and to lay out streets, alleys, squares, parks or other parts of the tract intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent to the streets, alleys, squares, parks, or other parts, was legally obligated to, but has failed to have a plat of the subdivision prepared, approved by the commissioners court, and filed, the owner of a residential lot which was created by the subdivision may have a plat of the individual lot prepared and approved by the commissioners court as provided in this section in lieu of the filing of a plat of the subdivision. 
(d)  Special criteria. The commissioners court may approve the plat of a residential lot which does not comply with the provisions of §§ 364.15(b) of this title (sale restrictions), 364.36 of this title (Setbacks), 364.37 of this title (Number of Dwellings per Lot), 364.52 of this title (Final Engineering Report), and 364.54 of this title (Financial Guarantees for Improvements) as applied to an individual subdivided lot if such approval is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these rules so that the public health, safety, and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. 
(1)  Owners of individual lots in a single unplatted subdivision may file a joint request for approval of their respective individual residential lots. 
(2)  An application for approval of the plat of an individual lot shall be made in writing. The application shall state specifically the chapter, section, or subsection with which the plat does not comply and from which a waiver is being requested. The application shall contain available information and documentation which supports the requested approval. The applicant shall also provide such additional documentation as the commissioners court may request to support the application, including: 
(a)  A copy of a dated plat, sales contract, utility records, or other acceptable documentation that the subdivision occurred prior to September 1, 1989; 
(b)  The name and address of the original subdivider or the subdivider's authorized agent, if known; 
(c)  A survey and plat of the lot for which approval is requested, showing existing residences, roads, and utilities; and 
(d)  A deed, an affidavit of ownership or other evidence of ownership of the lot for which approval is requested. 
(3)  Approval of plats of individual lots shall be granted subject to the limitations of state law, and based on written findings by the city that: 
(a)  The lot for which approval is requested is within a tract that was subdivided prior to September 1, 1989, and is not owned by the original subdivider; 
(b)  A plat was required for the subdivision, but has not been filed with the county by the subdivider legally obligated to file it; 
(c)  An existing, currently occupied residential dwelling is located on the lot; 
(d)  Existing water and sewer services which comply with the minimum standards set forth herein are available to the lot; and 
(e)  The request is reasonable, compliance with specified sections of these rules is impractical, and a waiver is not contrary to the public health and safety. 
(e)  Final determination. The City Commission of the City of Weslaco shall make the final decision on an application for a waiver, following review and recommendation by the city planning department. The applicant may withdraw a request for a waiver at any point in the process. If the requested waiver application is approved by the city commissioner, the city shall issue a certificate stating that a plat of the residential lot has been reviewed and approved.

DIVISION 4. - ENFORCEMENT 

Section 4.1. - Oversight. 
    The owner, by submitting a plat, acknowledges the authority of the city and state agencies to lawfully enter and inspect property for purposes of execution of their statutory duties. Such inspection will not release the owner from any obligation to comply with the requirements of these rules. 
(Ord. No. 2005-46, § II(4.1), 11-1-2005)
