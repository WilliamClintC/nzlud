Preface
The Layton Municipal Code of Layton, Utah, was initially published in-house. In 2017, codification and
administration of the Municipal Code began with the assistance of Municipal Code Online, Inc. This
Municipal Code shall be cited as the Layton Municipal Code or “LMC” as an acronym.
LMC is fully current, but we are in the process of reviewing various hard copy ordinances to
perfect the existing legislative histories of each section.
This Municipal Code maintains a structure by subject matter using a decimal numbering system
identifying the title, chapter, and section (for example: 1.01.010).
? The first number in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the title level
? The second series of numbers (1.01.010) designates the chapter level
? The last series (1.01.010) designates the section level
? If a fourth series exists comprising letters or numbers beyond the section level, it designates a
subsection level.
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching the Municipal Code and to assist in
subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to the Municipal Code. Vacant titles, chapters, or
sections may be designed for future use and may be marked “Reserved” to ease internal expansion.
To outline, give structure, and more granularly reference the legislation herein, the following list order (or
pattern of ascending alphanumeric characters) is used: A, 1, a, (1), (A), (a). Drafting legislation with this
list order better reconciles the content in local software and hard copies, with the content in this online
code.
The legislative history beneath a legislation's content identifies the specific legal sources, and may be
provided to substantiate the online code.
The Municipal Code is supplemented from time to time with amendments and additions made by Layton
City. The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal Code have been adapted during the
codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies
between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal
Code Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Municipal Code for easy reference and
convenience.
NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF
LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN
THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE
ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES
OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT SHARON WIGGINS,
ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL ASSISTANT.

1.23.010 Policy Considerations
There is an underlying policy in the City, strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving
constitutional taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of
the uncertainty and expense involved in defending law suits alleging such issues. At the same time, the
legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the public's right
to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Constitution. Consistent with this
policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of
a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist governments in considering decisions that may
involve constitutional takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as
guidelines for such considerations. This ordinance is further intended and shall be construed to
objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific government action should require payment
of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of the City to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its
other duties and functions.
Ord. No. 97-35, Recodified, 6/19/1997
1.23.020 Definitions
1. "Constitutional taking" means actions by the City involving the physical taking or exaction of
private real property that might require compensation to a private real property owner because
of:
a. the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
b. Article I, Section 22, of the Utah Constitution; and
c. any Court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of private real property by a
government entity.
2. Actions by the City involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property is not a
constitutional taking if the physical taking or exaction:
a. bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
b. is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an individualized property basis, both
in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development on the legitimate
government interest.

2.50.010 Procedure
It shall be the policy of Layton City to adjust grievances of employees promptly and fairly, within the
framework of existing laws and regulations. Every effort shall be made to adjust grievances in a manner
mutually satisfactory to employees and management. Any employee, who believes that the employee
has received inequitable treatment because of some condition of employment, may personally, or
through a representative, appeal for relief from that condition. In any grievance not involving discharge,
suspension without pay for more than two (2) days, or an involuntary transfer to a position of less
remuneration, the following procedures shall be followed:
Step 1. The employee shall submit the grievance in writing to the department director within five (5)
working days after the occurrence of the grievance. Within five (5) working days, after receiving the
grievance, the department director shall meet with the employee to discuss the grievance. The
department director may refer the matter to a supervisor. However, the department director must be
informed of the result reached and must make a determination regarding that result within the same
five (5) working days.
Step 2. If no satisfactory agreement is reached after Step 1 and a party desires to carry the
grievance further, the interested party shall, within five (5) working days of the department director's
decision, appeal the grievance, in writing, to the City Manager. The City Manager, upon reviewing
the grievance and the department director's decision, may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision or
may remand the matter to the department director for further consideration as directed. A
department director's decision, made after a remand, is again appealable to the City Manager. The
decision of the City Manager shall be final.

This Chapter shall be known as the "Sales and Use Tax Ordinance of the City of Layton."
Ord. No. 97-35, Recodified, 6/19/1997
3.04.020 Purpose
The forty-eighth session of the Utah Legislature of Utah has authorized the counties and municipalities
of the State of Utah to enact sales and use tax ordinances imposing a one percent (1%) tax.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to conform the sales and use tax of the municipality to the requirements
of the Sales and Use Tax Act, Chapter 12 of Title 59, Utah Code (as amended).
Ord. No. 97-35, Recodified, 6/19/1997
3.04.030 Effective Date

collected and paid, a tax upon every retail sale of tangible personal property, services,
and meals made within the municipality at the rate of one percent (1%).
b. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in this
municipality of tangible personal property from any retailer on or after the operative date
of this Chapter at the rate of one percent (1%) of the sales price of the property.

c. For the purpose of this Chapter, all retail sales shall be presumed to have been
consummated at the place of business delivered by the retailer or his agent, to an out-ofstate
destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. In the
event a retailer has no permanent place of business, the place or places at which the
retail sales are consummated shall be as determined under the rules and regulations
prescribed by and adopted by the State Tax Commission. Public utilities, as defined by
Title 54, Utah Code (as amended), shall not be obligated to determine the place or places
within any county or municipality where public utilities services are rendered, but the
place of sale or the sales tax revenue arising from such service allocable to the City shall
be as determined by the State Tax Commission, pursuant to an appropriate formula and
other rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by it.
2. a. Except as hereinafter provided, and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the
provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act, all of the provisions of Chapter 12, Title 59, Utah
Code (as amended), and in force and effect on the effective date of this Chapter, insofar
as they relate to sales taxes, excepting Sections 59-12-101 and 59-12-119 thereof, are
hereby adopted and made a part of the Chapter as though fully set forth herein.
b. Wherever, and to the extent that in Chapter 12 of Title 59, Utah Code (as amended), the
State of Utah is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this municipality
shall be substituted therefor. Nothing in paragraph (2) shall be deemed to require
substitution of the name of the municipality for the word "state" when that word is used as
part of the title of the State Tax Commission, or of the Constitution of the State of Utah,
nor shall the name of the municipality be substituted for that of the state in any section
when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the
municipality or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Tax Commission in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of the Chapter.
c. If an annual license has been issued to a retailer under Section 59-12-106, Utah Code (as
amended), an additional license shall not be required by reason of this Section.
d. There shall be excluded from the purchase price paid or changed by which the tax is
measured:
i. the amount of any sales or use tax imposed by the state of Utah upon a retailer or
consumer; and
ii. the gross receipts from the sale of or the cost of storage, use, or other
consumption of tangible personal property, upon which a sales or use tax has
become due by reason of the sale transaction to any other municipality and any
county in the state of Utah, under the sales or use tax ordinance enacted by that
county or municipality in accordance with the Sales and Use Tax Act.
Ord. No. 97-35, Recodified, 6/19/1997
3.04.050 Penalties
Any person violating any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine in an amount less than Three Hundred Dollars
($300.00) or imprisonment for a period of not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.

3.16.124 Construed According To Utah Law
3.16.010 Declaration Of Finding And Intent
1. The City finds that the rights-of-way within the City:
a. are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social
life of the City;
b. are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that
intent;
c. can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities
delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health,
welfare, and general economic well-being of the City and its citizens; and
d. are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize
the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to
minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities'
construction, placement, relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
2. Finding regarding compensation. The City finds that the City should receive fair and
reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
3. Finding regarding local concern. The City finds that while telecommunications systems are in
part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal
franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
4. Finding regarding promotion of telecommunications services. The City finds that it is in the
best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of
telecommunications services, on a non-discriminatory basis, responsive to community and public
interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational, and community services.
5. Findings regarding franchise standards. The City finds that it is in the interests of the public to
franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
a. fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory
basis as provided herein;
b. encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may
use the rights-of-way to serve the public;
c. fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that may flow from such
commercial use of rights-of-way;
d. protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of the City, in a
manner consistent with federal and state law;
e. otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the City
infrastructure;
f. protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights-of-way; and
g. insures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that
such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting telecommunication services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 ("Act") [P.L. No. 96-104].

providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act.

3.16.031 Every Provider Must Obtain
Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent
jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a
telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the rights-of-way, and every
provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing open video

service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the Cable TV companies to the extent the City
is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any
appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does
not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a
cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide
telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.

in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased, except as may be expressly
provided in a franchise agreement. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before colocating its system on the property of others, including
the City's property. This Section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to
another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.

service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a
franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of Section 3.16.093.

As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this ordinance, a provider

in addition to all other fees, permits or charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of
application, Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) as a non-refundable application fee.
2. Franchise fees. The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the franchise agreement. The
obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on the completion date. The franchise fee is
offset by any business license fee or business license tax enacted by the City. Until such time as
any telecommunication company, doing business in Layton City, shall enter into a franchise
agreement, the company shall pay a fee of four percent (4%) of gross revenues, as defined
herein, to the City. Upon the execution of a franchise agreement, the terms of that agreement
shall govern the payment of the fee.

reasonable costs and reasonable expenses that the City incurs for the services of third parties (including

such other reports as the license officer shall order.
2. Provisional order. When the license officer has been notified that a licensee is in violation of this
Title or of any law or ordinance, and said violation is not an immediate threat to the public's health,
safety, or welfare, or is not otherwise so egregious as to warrant immediate intervention, the license
officer shall issue to the affected person a provisional order to comply.
a. The provisional order shall be in writing and shall apprise the person affected of the specific
violations. In the absence of the person affected or their agent or employee, a copy of such
notice shall be affixed to some structure on the premises. The deposit of the notice in the
United States mail, to the name and address provided on the business license application,
shall constitute service thereof.
b. The provisional order shall require compliance within five (5) business days of the mailing of
the order to the affected person.
c. If before the expiration of the five (5) day period for compliance the licensee requests, in
writing, a hearing, the license officer shall order and conduct a hearing within five (5) business
days of the request. Notice of such hearing shall be given in the manner prescribed herein.
The applicant may be represented by counsel at the hearing and may produce any evidence
relevant to the question. Within three (3) days of the conclusion of the hearing, the license
officer shall make findings, enter a final order, and mail the final order to the affected person.
3. Hearing regarding license status. At the time the license officer prepares the provisional order, the
license officer is also to prepare a notice to the licensee regarding a hearing to determine what, if
any, action will be taken regarding the licensee's business license. Said notice shall set forth the
specific violations to be addressed at the hearing and set forth the date, time, and location of the
hearing. The notice shall either be served with the provisional order or separately in the same
manner as the provisional order. Said hearing shall be set no sooner than five (5) business days from
the date of the notice. The applicant may be represented by counsel at the hearing and may produce
any evidence relevant to violations. Within four (4) business days of the conclusion of the hearing, the
license officer shall make findings, enter a final order, and mail the final order to the licensee.
4. Authority of license officer. In accordance with the provisions of this Title, upon written request or
on the officer's own motion, the license officer shall have the authority to extend the time for

necessary for an entity operating without a license, the entity shall immediately cease all business at
all places where the entity is operating and found to be in violation. No refund of any portion of the
license fee shall be made to the licensee if said license has been revoked or suspended.

days following the effective date of the action or decision complained of. A time for hearing shall be

hearing the City Manager shall make and enter findings of fact and an order, and that decision shall
be final and conclusive. A copy thereof shall be mailed to the appellant to the name and address
provided in the written appeal.
7. Summary action. When the conduct of any licensee, agent, or employee, or any unlicensed person
conducting or operating a business is an imminent threat to the public health, safety, or general
welfare, or is otherwise so egregious so as to warrant immediate intervention, the City Manager shall
have authority to summarily order the cessation of business and the close of premises or to suspend
or revoke the subject license. Unless waived in writing by the licensee, within five (5) days after the
summary action, a special hearing with regard to such action shall be held by the City Manager.
Notice of such hearing shall be given in the manner prescribed herein. The findings and order of the
City Manager following the hearing shall be final and conclusive and shall be mailed to the appellant

after a hearing on appeal from action of the license officer, may be filed in a court of competent
jurisdiction.
9. Liability of violator. The amount of any unpaid fee, the payment of which is required hereunder,
shall constitute a debt to the City. The City Attorney, at the direction of the City Manager, may
institute a civil action in the name of the City to recover any such unpaid fee. No civil judgment or any
act by the City Attorney or any other agent of the City shall be a bar to prevent a criminal prosecution
for each and every violation of this Chapter. In addition, the City Attorney may pursue other remedies
legally allowable for enforcement of this Chapter.

Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their
residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief,
political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City has a substantial
interest in protecting the well being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the
ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has a substantial
interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal
activity.
There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its citizens, and the effect of the
regulations in this Chapter on those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of City officials
derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding
to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers
and those affected by door-to-door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions regarding doorto-
door solicitation, the City adopts this Chapter to promote the City's substantial interests in:
1. Respecting citizen's decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
2. Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
3. Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious, political position, or charitable
activities; and
4. Permitting truthful and non-misleading door-to-door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in
intrastate or interstate commerce.
The City finds that the procedures, rules, and regulations set forth in this Chapter are narrowly tailored to
preserve and protect the City interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those
regulated.

1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to
promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations applicable thereto. The provisions of this ordinance have neither
the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent, nor effect of this
ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to
their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material. It is a purpose hereof to protect the citizenry from the detrimental
secondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses.

2. Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the
community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Council, and on findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v.
American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991),
and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis,
Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los
Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the
Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6,
1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
a. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities.
Thus, the City desires to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises;
b. Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this ordinance as adult theatres
and cabarets, engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit behavior than employees of
other establishments;
c. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented
businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for
viewing films, videos, or live sex shows;
d. Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy
conditions;
e. Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented
businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented
businesses;
f. At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually
oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B
amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections;
g. Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported
cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States -- 600
in 1982; 2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985; 253,448 in 1992; and 621,329 as of
August 31, 1997;
h. As of September 26, 1997, there are 1467 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Utah;
i. Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons
testing positive for the HIV antibody test in Utah;
j. The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported
annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of
1990;
k. The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high
level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990;
l. The office of the Surgeon General of the United States, in a report dated October 22, 1986,
advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual
contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from
an infected mother to her newborn;
m. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and
gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts;
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=5_Business_Regulations_And_Licenses 75/93
n. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the
activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of
the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those facilities;
o. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually
oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films;
p. The findings noted in Paragraphs (a) through (o) raise substantial governmental concerns;
q. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns;
r. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that
reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of
its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented
business, falls in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein;
s. Prohibiting doors or similar partitions on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on
premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal
and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres;
t. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and certain past employees, will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by
preventing minors from working in such establishments;
u. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-today
operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is
substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will
aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases;
v. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited
amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which
this ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity;
w. The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related
crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention of this ordinance;
x. The barring, of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years
serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases; and
y. The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by
the enactment of this ordinance.

8.04.020 Abatement Of Public Nuisance Animals
When it reasonably appears to the City that any animal is a nuisance as defined in this Chapter, and that
such nuisance should be abated, the City shall first attempt to obtain the written consent of the animal's
owner to abate the animal. Abatement shall be defined to include either relocating or euthanizing the
animal. If the animal owner's consent cannot be readily obtained, the City may file a complaint in the
District Court charging the maintenance of a nuisance. The charge shall set forth the facts according to
the best of the City's information and belief, indicating that the owner is maintaining a nuisance, and the
nuisance should be abated. Until such time as the owner may be summoned to appear before the court,
the animal(s) may be taken into impound by the Animal Control Department and held there pending a
decision by the court. If the complaint is denied, a hearing will be set pursuant to the normal procedure
of the court. If the court finds that the complaint of maintaining a nuisance has been proven by a
preponderance of the evidence, the City will seek an order from the court setting out the method of
abatement. Abatement by relocation shall not be an option, if the animal represents a continuing threat
of serious harm, such as in the case of a vicious dog. If relocation is ordered, the court may set whatever
conditions are necessary to guarantee that the said animal shall not constitute a nuisance in the future.
In the event the court determines that the animal is a nuisance, the owner shall pay the cost of all
impoundment fees, maintenance fees, or any other fee that may incur as a result of such impoundment.

4. Exception for building maintenance and repair.
a. Whoever, being the owner of land abutting that of another, the building or buildings on
which are so close to the land of such other person as to require an entry on said abutting
land for the purpose of maintaining or repairing said building or buildings in order to
prevent waste, shall not be deemed guilty of trespass or liable civilly for damages,
provided that such entry is made:
i. expeditiously;
ii. exercising due care that no damage is caused by such entry to the land or
buildings of said abutting owner;
iii. after having notified the police chief or designee that the owner has requested
permission to enter on adjoining land from the owner or agent thereof for the
purpose of maintaining or repairing a building or buildings and that such
permission was refused and the owner’s entry is for the purpose stated herein;
and
iv. after having posted a bond with the City in the amount of One Thousand Dollars
($1,000) to protect against any damage to the adjoining property by said entry.

days in the aggregate in any calendar year.
c. After said entry, said owner shall in all respects restore said adjoining land to the
condition in which it was prior to said entry.
d. The purpose of the posting of a bond in (4)(a)(iv) above is to provide a defined resource
for the adjoining property owner in case damages occur. If no demand is made on the
bond within sixty (60) days of the completion of the repair or maintenance, the bond will
be released to the posting entity. If a dispute regarding damages arises, the bond will be
interpled, as the City is not party to any such action. The City is not liable for any conduct
of any property owner acting or purporting to act under this code section. This code
section does not create a legal relationship between the City and the subject property
owners.
5. Criminal trespass is a Class B misdemeanor. If the offense is committed within a dwelling it shall
be punishable as provided by State law. If the offense is committed in the common area of a
condominium unit it is punishable as in infraction.

public way to alter, modify, or relocate such facilities or structures as the City Engineer may
require. Sewers, pipes, drains, tunnels, conduits, pipe driveways, vaults, trash receptacles, and
overhead and underground gas, electric, telephone, telecommunication and communication
facilities shall specifically be subject to such directives. The person owning or maintaining the
facilities or structures shall, at their own cost and expense and upon reasonable written notice by
the City, promptly protect, or promptly alter or relocate such facilities or structures, or part
thereof, as directed by the City. In the event that such person refuses or neglects to conform to
the directive of the City, the City shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate
such part of the facilities or structures without liability to such person. Such person shall pay to
the City all costs incurred by the City in connection with such excavation performed by the City,
including also design, engineering, construction, materials, insurance, court costs and attorneys
fees.

by the person owning or maintaining the facilities or structures involved.
4. Any directive of the City Engineer under this Section shall be under and consistent with the City's
police power. Unless an emergency condition exists, the City Engineer shall make a good faith
effort to consult with the person regarding any condition that may result in a removal or relocation
of facilities in the public way to consider possible avoidance or minimization of removal or
relocation requirements and provide the directive as far enough in advance of the required
removal or relocation to allow the person a reasonable opportunity to plan and minimize cost
associated with the required removal or relocation.
5. This obligation does not apply to facilities or structures originally located on private property
pursuant to a private easement, which property was later incorporated into the public way, if that
prior private easement grants a superior vested right.
6. Any person owning or maintaining facilities or structures in the public way who fails to alter,
modify, or relocate such facilities or structures upon notice to do so by the City Engineer shall be
guilty of a class B misdemeanor. All costs of alteration, modification, or relocation shall be borne

water service connection to a customer's premises, where it is physically and economically
infeasible to find, permanently eliminate, or control all actual or potential cross connections within
the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention
assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system
where there are actual or potential cross connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or
controlled at the point of the cross connection (isolation) and before the first branch line leading
off the service line.
12. "Service connection": The service connection shall be defined as the water meter yoke
assembly with the City being responsible up to the discharge piping from the meter yoke.

1. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water
purveyor unless an approved backflow assembly protects the water supply.
2. The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized
representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether cross connections or other structural
or sanitary hazards exist (including violation of this ordinance), and to audit the results of the
required survey.
3. Whenever the public water purveyor deems that a service connection's water usage contributes
a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be
installed on the service line of the identified consumer's water system at or near the property line
or immediately inside the building being served, but in all cases, before the first branch line
leading off the service line. The costs thereof are the responsibility of the consumer.
4. The type of protective assembly required under Section (3), shall depend upon the degree of
hazard which exists at the point of cross connection (whether direct or indirect), applicable to
local and state requirements or resulting from the required survey.
5. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this
Section but were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of
installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and
maintenance requirements under Section (6) below, be excluded from the requirements of this
rule so long as the water purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the public water
system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location or requires more
than minimum maintenance, or when the water purveyor finds that the operation or maintenance
of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved
backflow prevention assembly.
6. It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention
assemblies are installed, to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once

limits:
1. Any person located outside the City limits and desiring to be supplied with water from the City
waterworks system and being willing to pay in advance the whole expense of extending the
water system to his property, including the cost of extending the water main from its present
location to the City limits, may make application to the Council by petition containing:
a. a description of such proposed extension,
b. accompanied by a map showing the location thereof,
c. an offer to pay the whole expense incurred by the City in providing such extension and to
advance such expense as the expense shall be certified to by the water supervisor,

extensions and reconstruction, an agreement to comply with the requirements of the
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Subsection relating to payment,
e. an agreement that no user other than the applicant or applicants approved by the Council
shall be permitted to connect to or receive water service through the private line without
first making application therefor and receiving the approval of the Council, and that in the
event an unauthorized user is permitted to obtain water service through the private line,
the Council shall have power to discontinue all water service through the line,
f. an agreement to maintain the private water line in good and watertight condition and that
in the event the Council determines that the private line is in need of repair or is otherwise

https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=13_Water_And_Sewers 16/58
The minimum standard for fire flow is as required in Appendix B of the International Fire Code as
adopted in the Layton Municipal Code, Title 16. This requirement may be increased for extreme growth
of combustible vegetation, oak brush, access, and exposures, as well as dwelling size and construction
type.

Ord. No. 10-12, Repealed, 6/17/2010
13.10.040 Alternative Methods Allowed
1. If a proposed development cannot satisfy the fire flow requirements, the developer, with City
approval, may:
a. provide on-site reservoirs to be constructed by the developer; and/or
b. alter the construction type and/or materials to reduce the required fire flow; and/or
c. cause that all habitable buildings be provided with an approved automatic fire sprinkler
system to offset and reduce the gallons per minute (GPM) requirements for fire flow;
and/or
d. replace pertinent water lines with larger size lines. The Fire Chief, in conjunction with the
City Engineer, shall establish or identify the requirements and standards in utilizing any
such alternatives or any combination thereof.
2. Regardless of the measures taken to reduce the amount of fire flow required, the minimum flow
shall meet the requirements of Appendix B of the International Fire Code as amended in Title 16.
3. A permit for development or construction may be issued in an area where existing fire flow does
not meet the City's requirements only upon a finding of all of the following:
a. A new or additional water line, which will service the subject area, is under construction to
the extent that the subject area will have access to the additional water supply prior to or
near the time of completion;
b. The City Engineer has determined that the additional water supply will provide the
necessary gallons per minute (GPM) and pressure for the construction and occupancy
type;
c. The existing fire flow is one thousand (1,000) gallons per minute (GPM) for sixty (60)
minutes;
d. The type, density, and exposure of the building materials, and their proximity to other
structures, do not create a significant hazard, absent the required fire flow;
e. The developer or permit holder agrees that if the newly completed water supply does not
provide the required fire flow, the development will be equipped with automatic fire
sprinklers and whatever other measures required by the Fire Chief, pursuant to this
Chapter and the currently adopted International Fire Code, necessary to bring the
structure into compliance with the fire protection requirements; and
f. The developer or permit holder agrees that no certificate of occupancy will be issued until
the development or structure is in compliance with the fire protection requirements.

install additional facilities or upgrade the system to ensure that the minimum standards are maintained. If
in doing so, and at the City's request, the installed facilities or upgrades exceed that which would
otherwise be required by the proposed development, the City will enter into a payback agreement with
the developer and the reimbursement to the developer will be made for said excess as development that
benefits thereby occurs. The payback agreement will be at the City's schedule and the water system
shall be developed as per the capital improvement process of the City.

13.10.060 Fire Flow Peak Instantaneous Demands
The available fire flow, as determined by the current water model developed by the City Engineer, may
be used to approximate the potential fire flows available in certain areas of the City. However, actual
flow tests may be required, as determined by the City Engineer or Fire Chief. Said water model shall be
reviewed prior to preliminary site plan approval and before submitting plans to the Planning Commission
on any project, subdivision, or development.

13.10.070 Water System Pumps
In certain areas of Layton City pumps are used to transfer water between water storage facilities. These
pumps are not in continuous use and may be only used seasonally. Future development in these areas
may require an upsizing of the existing water lines as the effect of the pumps will not be used to
calculate the available gallons per minute (GPM) required for fire flow to any project, development, or
building.

The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, preserve, and maintain existing and potential public drinking
water sources in order to safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare of City residents and visitors.
The intent of this ordinance is to establish and designate drinking water source protection zones and
groundwater recharge areas for all sources of public drinking water within City boundaries and
jurisdiction. This ordinance establishes criteria for regulating the storage, handling, use, or production of
hazardous or toxic substances within identified areas where groundwater is, or could be affected by the
potential contaminant source. This shall be accomplished by the designation and regulation of property
uses and conditions that may be maintained within such zones or areas. Unless otherwise specified, the
provisions of this ordinance apply to new development and/or handling, movement, and storage of
potentially hazardous materials.
The degree of protection afforded by this ordinance is considered adequate for regulatory purposes.
This ordinance does not ensure that public drinking water sources will not be subject to accidental or
intentional contamination, nor does it create liability on the part of the City, or an officer or employee
thereof, for any damages to the public water supplies from reliance on this ordinance nor any
administrative order lawfully made thereunder.
A notice to cease or an exemption issued under this ordinance shall not relieve the owner of the
obligation to comply with any other applicable federal, state, regional, or local regulations, rules,
ordinances, or requirements, nor shall said notice or exemption relieve any owner of any liability for
violation of such regulations, rules, ordinances, or requirements.

2. Method of calculation.
a. Calculation. The fees to be assessed on each parcel of property within the City shall be
based on the amount of runoff attributable to the use that the property is put to. Each
property shall be assigned an assessment as calculated by the City Engineer. Each
property within the City shall be classified according to the zoning use, using a national
standard for storm water calculation. An average parcel size shall be established for
residential uses. Commercial and industrial uses shall use an actual parcel size for the
calculation. The City engineer shall establish a per-acre cost of providing storm water
facilities based on the capital costs the City will incur. The amount of runoff shall be
represented by an assigned "runoff coefficient." The parcel size shall be multiplied by the
coefficient. The resulting number shall be multiplied by the per acre cost. The result of this
calculation should be approximately the cost to the City, of providing the proportional
share of necessary storm water improvements to service the area receiving the benefit.
Parcel Size (Acres) x Runoff Coeff. x Per Acre Cost of Improvements = Fee
b. Charge per parcel of property. The amount charged to each parcel of property as a
storm water fee, shall be established by the City Council and shall be contained and
updated in the City's Consolidated Fee Schedule.
c. Credit for storm water system improvements. Non-residential parcels with mitigating
storm water facilities that serve the City's regional storm water needs, as prescribed by
the storm water master plan and utilizing methods that meet the City's design and
maintenance standards may be eligible for a service fee credit. The credit may be granted
if property owners have not already been compensated for, or have agreed to construct
the facilities as part of the development process. The parcel's owner or agent must make
application for this credit to the City Engineer.

13.15.060 Billing And Collection
1. Utility Enterprise Fund. This ordinance creates the Storm Drainage Utility Fund. All revenues
received from storm drainage user fees shall be placed in the enterprise fund as a designated
fund, to be left separate and apart from all other City funds. The collection, accounting, and
expenditure of all storm water utility funds shall be in accordance with the Utah Municipal Fiscal
Procedures Act.
2. Billing. The City shall bill property owners for storm drainage utility services. Billing amounts
shall be included as a separate line item on utility bills. A billing will also be sent to owners of
parcels within the City who are not City utility customers.
3. Collection. Partial payments on a combined utility bill shall be applied consistent with the billing
procedures established by the City. Fees and charges shall be considered delinquent if not paid
as determined by the procedures established by the City and will be a debt to the City, which
shall be subject to recovery in a civil action. Pursuant to Section 10-8-38 Utah Code (as
amended), the City may cause the water service to the property to be shut off for failure to pay
for the storm drainage service furnished, as set forth on the billing.

4. Waivers for providing SWPPP: Every development shall provide for a SWPPP as required by
this ordinance, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the
SWPPP requirements shall be submitted to the Public Works Department for approval.
a. The minimum requirements for SWPPP may be waived in whole or in part upon written
request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
i. It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair
attainment of the objectives of this ordinance.
ii. Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm water
discharges have been established in a SWPPP that has been approved by the
Public Works Department and the implementation of the plan is required by local
ordinance.
iii. The Public Works Department finds that meeting the minimum on-site pollution
prevention plans are not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
iv. Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduces:
(1) the generation of storm water from the site;
(2) the size and cost of storm water storage; and
(3) the pollutants generated at the site.
b. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Public Works Department
may grant a waiver from compliance with these SWPPPs, as long as acceptable
mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department that the variance
will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
i. Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
ii. Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
iii. Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; and
iv. Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property.

5. Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP):
a. A SWPPP shall be required with all development applications and will include sufficient
information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc) to evaluate the environmental
characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the
site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and
acceptability of the measures proposed for managing storm water generated at the
project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of storm water

The City Council of Layton City (the "Council") finds and determines that growth and development
activity in the City will create additional demand and need for public streets and roads, publicly owned
parks, open space and recreational facilities, storm drainage and culinary water facilities, and public
safety facilities in the City, and the Council finds that growth and development activity should pay a
proportionate share of the cost of such planned facilities needed to serve the growth and development
activity. The Council further finds that impact fees are necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the
costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in comparison to the benefits already received and
yet to be received. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 36, Title 11, Utah Code (as amended), the Council
adopts this Title to assess impact fees for planned facilities. The provisions of this Title shall be liberally
construed in order to carry out the purposes of the Council in establishing the impact fee program.

dedication of land or money by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest for qualifying
improvements of the same category for which an impact fee was imposed.

4. The person applying for an offset shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and
improvements, construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications
necessary to the computation of the offset claimed. The Community and Economic Development
Director shall have no obligation to grant offsets to any person who cannot provide such
documentation in such form as the Community and Economic Development Director may
reasonably require.
5. The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised land value of the parent
parcel (which land value is based on the date of transfer of ownership to the City) as determined
by a certified appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant, and who used generally
accepted appraisal techniques or by written agreement between the City and the developer. If
the City disagrees with the appraised value, the City may engage another appraiser at the City's
expense, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two (2) appraisals. If
either party rejects the average of the two (2) appraisals, a third review appraisal shall be
obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being shared equally by the property owner and
the City. The review appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers, and the review
appraisal shall be binding on both the City and person applying for offset.
6. Offsets provided, for qualifying improvements, meeting the requirements of this Section, shall be
valid from the date of approval until ten (10) years after the date of approval or until the last date
of construction within the project, whichever occurs first.
7. The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed only by owners of property
within the development area for which the qualifying improvement was required.
8. Any claim for offsets must be made in writing, no later than the time of submittal of a building
permit application or application for another permit subsequent to development plan approval
that is subject to impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.

14.01.080 Developer Agreements For Impact Fees
Where a development includes or requires a qualifying improvement, the City and the developer may
agree in writing to have the developer participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the
qualifying improvements. Such agreement may provide for cash reimbursements, offsets, or other
appropriate compensation to the developer for the developer's participation in the financing and/or
construction of the improvements.
The agreement shall include:
1. The estimated cost of the qualifying improvements, using the lowest responsive bid by a qualified
bidder, which bid is approved by the Community and Economic Development Director; or, if no
bid is available, the estimated cost certified by a licensed Utah engineer and approved by the
Community and Economic Development Director;
2. A schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement;
3. A requirement that the improvement be designed and completed in compliance with any
applicable City or state laws or regulations; and
4. Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the City.

1. Any fee payer may pay the impact fees imposed by this Chapter under protest in order to obtain
the development approval and/or a building permit. Appeals regarding the impact fees imposed
on any development activity may only be taken by the fee payer of the property where such
development activity will occur. No appeal shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at
issue have been paid.
2. The Community and Economic Development Director's determinations with respect to the
applicability of the impact fees to a given development approval and/or a building permit, the
availability or an exemption, the availability or value of a credit, or the Community and Economic
Development Director's decision concerning the independent fee calculation which is authorized
in Section 14.01.160, or the impact fees imposed by the Community and Economic Development
Director pursuant to Section 14.01.160, or any other determination which the Community and
Economic Development Director is authorized to make pursuant to this Title, can be appealed to
the City Council.
3. Appeals shall be taken within thirty (30) days after payment of an impact fee. Appeals shall be
taken to the City Council by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Recorder, specifying the
grounds thereof, and depositing an administrative fee in the amount of Fifty Dollars ($50.00). The
person appealing the fee shall also submit, in writing, a request for information relative to the fee.
The Community and Economic Development Director shall transmit to the City Council and within
two (2) weeks of the written request for information, to the person appealing the fee, all papers
constituting the record for the determination, including the written analysis required by Section
11-36-301, Utah Code (as amended), and any other relevant information relating to the impact
fee.
4. The City Council shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal, give notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney. If the matter which is the subject of the appeal requires development approval which
also requires a hearing before the City Council, both the appeal and the development approval
hearing may be combined in a single hearing.
5. The City Council is authorized to make findings of fact regarding the applicability of the impact
fees to a given development activity, the availability or amount of the credit, or the accuracy or
applicability of an independent fee calculation. The decision of the City Council shall be final,
except as provided in this Section and shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the
appeal was filed.
6. The City Council may, so long as such action is in conformance with the provisions of this Title,
reverse or affirm, in whole or part, or may modify the determination of the Community and
Economic Development Director with respect to the amount of the impact fees imposed or the
credit awarded upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principles of fairness, and
may make such order, requirements, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that
end shall have the powers which have been granted to the Community and Economic
Development Director by this Title.
7. Any fee payer who believes that the decision of the City Council is based on erroneous
procedures, errors of law or fact, error in judgment, or has discovered new evidence which could
not be reasonably available at the prior hearing, may make a written request for reconsideration
by the City Council within ten (10) working days of the date the decision is rendered. Such fee
payer is the "appellant" for the purposes of this Section. This request shall set forth the specific
errors or new information relied upon by such appellant, and the City Council may, after review of
the record, take further action as it deems proper.
8. The filing of a request for reconsideration shall effectively stay the appeal period until the City
Council takes further action.

9. Where the City Council determines that there is a flaw in the impact fee program or that a
specific exemption or credit should be awarded on a consistent basis or that the principles of
fairness require amendments to this Title, they shall issue a decision requiring that such a
modification, change, or elimination of a fee or fee requirement, as is deemed necessary to
correct the flaw, be made.
10. Any fee payer aggrieved by a decision of the City Council may submit an appeal of the decision
to a court of competent jurisdiction within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date the
challenge to the impact fee was filed. All appeals to the district court shall be made pursuant to
Section 11-36-401, Utah Code (as amended).

calculated and collected in conjunction with the application for the first building permit or
electrical permit, certificate of compliance or occupancy, or other permit subsequent to
development plan approval, for such development, whichever occurs first in time.

collected for a particular type of public facility within the service area shall be credited. Such fees
shall be invested by the City and the yield on such fees, at the actual rate of return to the City,
shall be credited to such accounting fund periodically in accordance with the accounting policies

7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=14_Impact_Fees 11/14
1. If the City fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within six (6) years of when the impact
fees were paid, or where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as
established pursuant to Section 14.01.100 (1), the current owner of the property on which impact
fees have been paid may receive a refund of such impact fees. In determining whether impact
fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or
encumbered on a first in, first out basis.
2. The City shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal
Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant or claimant must be the
owner of the property.
3. Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one (1) year
period shall be retained by the City and expended on the appropriate planned facilities.
4. Refunds of impact fees under this Section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by
the City, calculated at the average interest rate earned by the City on the impact fee account
over the preceding fiscal year.
5. When the City seeks to terminate any or all components of the impact fee program, all
unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including
interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this Section. Upon the find that any or all impact
fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and the
availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two (2) times and shall notify
all potential claimants by first class mail at the last known address of the claimants. All funds
available for refund shall be retained for a period of one (1) year. At the end of one (1) year, any
remaining funds shall be retained by the City, but must be expended for the appropriate planned
facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered
balances within the impact fee account(s) being terminated.
6. The City shall also refund to the developer on a development activity for which impact fees have
been paid, all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development
activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur; provided, that if the City has
expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund, the
City can decline to provide the refund. If within a period of three (3) years, the same or
subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development
activity, the owner can petition the City for an offset. The petitioner must provide proof of
payment of impact fees previously paid for a development of the same or substantially similar
nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The Community and Economic
Development Director shall determine whether to grant an offset. Determinations of the
Community and Economic Development Director shall be in writing and shall be subject to the
appeals procedures set forth in Section 14.01.080.
7. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the impact
fees to the Community and Economic Development Director within one (1) year of the date the
right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.

percent (3%) of the amount of the refund.

will reasonably benefit the development activity.

constructed improvements or incurred costs.
4. Impact fees may be used to recoup the cost of studying, analyzing, and preparing the impact
fees.
5. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced
provision of City improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be
used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities
or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this Section and are used to
serve the development activity.

Except as herein otherwise provided, impact fees are in addition to any other requirements, taxes, fees,
or assessments imposed by the City on development or the issuance of building permits or certificates of
occupancy which are imposed on and due against property within the jurisdiction of the City. Impact fees
are intended to be consistent with the City's General Plan, Capital Improvements Plan, land
development ordinances, and other City policies, ordinances, and resolutions by which the City seeks to
ensure the provision of capital facilities in conjunction with development.
In addition to the use of impact fees, the City may finance qualifying capital improvements through the
issuance of bonds, the formation of assessment districts, or any other authorized mechanism, in such
manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.

14.01.160 Independent Fee Calculations
1. If the Community and Economic Development Director believes in good faith that none of the
impact fee categories or impact fee amounts set forth in the schedules in the appendixes
accurately describe or capture the impacts of a development activity on planned facilities, the
Community and Economic Development Director may conduct independent fee calculations. The
Community and Economic Development Director may impose alternative impact fees on a
specific development activity based on these calculations. The alternative impact fees and the
calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer.
2. If a fee payer opts not to have the impact fees determined according to the schedules set forth in
the appendixes, then the fee payer shall prepare and submit to the Community and Economic
Development Director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which final
plat, PRUD, site plan, or other development approval, or a building permit is sought. The
documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was
made. The appropriate City staff persons shall review the independent fee calculation and
provide an analysis to the Community and Economic Development Director concerning whether
the independent fee calculation should be accepted, rejected, or accepted in part. The
Community and Economic Development Director may adopt, reject, or adopt in part the
independent fee calculation based on the analysis prepared by appropriate City staff persons,
and based on the specific characteristics of the development activity, and/or principles of
fairness. The impact fees or alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set forth in
writing and shall be mailed to the fee payer.
3. Any fee payer submitting an independent fee calculation will be required to pay the City of
Layton, a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the independent fee calculation. The fee shall be One
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) plus the actual cost of any additional staff time in excess of One
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) spent in review, and the cost of consultant services if the City
deems these services to be necessary, provided, however, for independent fee calculations for
single residential lots where, in the sole discretion of the Community and Economic Development
Director, the issues involved are easily handled and the fee is clearly excessive, the One
Hundred Fifty Dollar ($150.00) fee may be reduced. The City shall require the fee payer to post a
cash deposit of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) prior to initiating the review.
4. While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in the City Capital Improvements Plan
are valid, the Community and Economic Development Director shall consider the documentation
submitted by the fee payer and the analysis prepared by the appropriate City staff persons, but is
not required to accept such documentation or analysis which the Community and Economic
Development Director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the
alternative, require the fee payer to submit additional or different documentation for
consideration. The Community and Economic Development Director is authorized to adjust the
impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific
characteristics of the development activity, and/or principles of fairness. The impact fees or
alternative impact fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the
fee payer.
5. Determinations made by the Community and Economic Development Director pursuant to this
Section may be appealed to the City Council subject to the procedures set forth in Section
14.01.080.

15.28.010 Findings Of Fact
1. The flood hazard areas of Layton City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood
hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage
uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions for:
1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water
or erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

c. Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development adversely
affects the flood carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard. For the purposes of
this Chapter, "adversely affects" means damage to adjacent properties because of rises
in flood stages attributed to physical changes of the channel and the adjacent overbank
areas.
i. If it is determined that there is no adverse affect and the development is not a
building or structure, then the permit shall be granted without further
consideration.
ii. If it is determined that there is an adverse effect, then technical justification, (i.e., a
registered professional engineer) for the proposed development shall be required.
iii. If the proposed development is a building, then the provisions of this Chapter shall
apply.
2. Use of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in
accordance with Section 15.28.060, the City Engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation data available. "FIRM" draft and preliminary map, from a federal, state,
or other source, may be used in order to administer Section 15.28.150(5).
3. Information to be obtained and maintained.
a. Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether the
structure contains a basement.
b. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
i. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the
structure has been floodproofed; and
ii. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section 15.28.110(3).
c. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance.
4. Alteration of watercourses.
a. Notify adjacent communities and the Utah State Division of Water Rights, and the Utah
Division of Emergency Services and Homeland Security prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
b. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
5. Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Any person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section 15.28.140.
6. Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement
of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
7. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.

2. Conditions for variances.
a. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places,
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Section. Variances
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures shall be granted only upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
b. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
d. Variances shall only be issued upon:
i. a showing of good and sufficient cause;
ii. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
iii. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section
15.28.140(d), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
e. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
structure will be permitted to be built in accordance with the conditions established by the
Land Use Appeal Authority and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with
the increased risk of flooding.
3. Variances distinguished. The variances authorized in this Title are not to be equated by those
authorized in Title 19. The variances granted pursuant to this Title 15 are not to run with the land
nor be permanent. These variances are to grant a temporary relief and may be revoked upon a
subsequent determination of detrimental results attributable to said variances.

construction shall not be allowed within any designated one hundred (100) year
flood hazard area.
b. Nonresidential construction.
i. Substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the
level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
(1) be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(2) have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(3) be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the
standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be
provided to the official as set forth in Section 15.28.130.
c. No new construction of nonresidential structures shall be allowed within any one hundred
(100) year flood hazard area.

15.28.160 Floodways
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.28.060 are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which
carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=15_Buildings_And_Construction 32/32
1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, substantial improvements, and other development unless
certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge. All new construction and substantial improvements associated with any allowed
encroachments shall comply with all the applicable flood hazard reduction standards of Section
15.28.150.
2. Dumping permit required. It is unlawful for any person to dump or place any garbage, trees,
brush, dirt, refuse, rubbish, or other waste material in the bed or channel or any natural stream,
or in any watercourse, ravine, or gulley which usually carries storm waters or spring runoff waters
so as in any way to obstruct or interfere with the flow of such waters, without first obtaining a
permit to do so from the Planning Commission.
3. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
Regulations, a community may permit encroachments with the adopted regulatory floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for
a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

facilities permitted by this Agreement. It is the intent of this Chapter and subsequent amendments, to

17.01.105.1 Term
17.01.105.2 Other Ordinances
1. Grantor hereby grants to Grantee a nonexclusive Franchise to construct, operate, maintain, and
reconstruct, a Cable Communications System within the City. The Franchise shall constitute both
a right and an obligation to provide the services of a Cable Communications System as required
by the provisions of this Agreement.
a. This Franchise is granted under the terms and conditions contained herein and is
intended to be consistent with federal laws and regulations and state general laws and
regulations.
b. The Franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general City Code provisions now in
effect or hereafter made effective. Nothing in this Franchise shall be deemed to waive the
requirements of the other codes and ordinances of the Grantor regarding permits, fees to
be paid, or manner of construction. The Grantee agrees to abide by any existing or new
ordinances or regulations of general applicability to the operation of the Cable System in
the City, adopted in the manner provided by law, so long as they do not substantially
impair the rights granted pursuant to this Franchise.
c. Nothing in this Franchise shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from offering services
over its Cable System that is not prohibited by federal or state law.
2. Any renewals shall be conducted pursuant to applicable law in effect at that time, which is
currently Section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 and the Cable Television
and Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, as amended.
3. The Franchise granted is nonexclusive. The Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at
any time, such additional Franchises for a Cable Communications System as it deems
appropriate, provided however, that such additional grants shall not operate to materially modify,
revoke, or terminate any rights previously granted to any Grantee. The material provisions of
such additional Franchises shall be comparable to those of the existing Franchises in order that
an unfair competitive advantage is not granted to one operator over another. The City shall not
authorize or permit a System to operate within the Franchise area on terms or conditions more
favorable or less burdensome to such operator than those applied to the Grantee pursuant to this
Franchise.
4. Subject to federal law, no Cable Communications System shall be allowed to occupy or use the
streets or operate within the City without being granted a Franchise.
5. Subject to federal law, the City may establish appropriate requirements of new Franchises or
Franchise renewals, to reflect the future cable related community needs and interests, taking into
account the costs of meeting such needs and interests.
6. The Grantor may grant a Franchise for all or any defined portion of the City, provided that one
operator is not granted unfair competitive advantage over another by virtue of having been
awarded a Franchise.

be available for public inspection at places designated by the Grantor. Information identified by
Grantee or an applicant as "proprietary and confidential" shall not be disclosed by City without
Grantee's or the applicant's consent, except to the extent state law or any City ordinance
adopted pursuant to state law requires its disclosure. Subject to federal law, the Grantor may
grant or may decline to grant any Franchise.

17.01.105.1 Term
1. Term. The Franchise granted hereunder shall be for a term of fifteen (15) years commencing on
the effective date of the Franchise as set forth below, unless otherwise lawfully terminated in
accordance with the terms of this Franchise.
2. Periodic Review.
a. Subject to the provisions of this Subsection (2), on the fifth (5th) and again on the tenth
(10th) anniversary of the effective date of the Franchise, the Grantor may commence
proceedings, which afford public notice, public participation, and open meetings, for the
purpose of identifying future Cable System community needs and interests, including but
not limited to technological developments, EG Channel(s), on-going EG capital costs,
broad categories of programming, Institutional Network and customer service, and to
determine whether it would be appropriate to amend the Franchise to address
developments in the field of cable communications that may have taken place over the
course of time, and to review the Grantee's performance during the preceding five (5)
years. Any proposed amendment(s) of the Franchise under this Subsection (2) shall be
based upon the reasonable cable-related needs and interests of the Layton community
and take into consideration the costs to the Grantee of meeting those needs and
interests.
b. If, after conducting such review, the Grantor decides that amendments to the Franchise
are warranted, then it shall hold at least one (1) public hearing to enable the Grantee and
the public to comment on each of the proposed Franchise amendments.
c. If, following such hearings, the Grantor determines that amendments to the Franchise are
warranted, and/or that material changes in the Grantee's obligations under the Franchise
are warranted, and if the Grantee is willing to comply with such amendments and/or
changes, the parties shall amend the Franchise accordingly.
d. If, however, the Grantee is not willing to comply with such Franchise amendments and/or
changes as a result of the hearings, either party, as their sole remedy, may within ninety
(90) days after the Grantor's determination, provide notice to the other party, pursuant to
Section 626 of the Cable Act, that it wishes to commence proceedings to renew the

1. The Franchise shall not be deemed to expressly or impliedly authorize the Grantee to construct
or install poles or wire-holding structures within streets for the purpose of placing cables, wires,
lines, or otherwise, without the written consent of the City. Such consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld and shall include a requirement that the Grantee perform, at its sole expense, all tree
trimming required to maintain the poles, cable, and wires clear of obstructions.
2. With respect to any poles or wire-holding structures which Grantee is authorized to construct and
install within streets, a public utility or public utility district serving the City may, if denied the
privilege of utilizing such pole or wire-holding structures by the Grantee, apply for such
permission to the City Council. If the City Council finds that such use would enhance the public
convenience and would not unduly interfere with the Grantee's present and future operations, the
City Council may authorize such use subject to such terms and conditions as may reasonably be
agreed between the parties. Such authorization shall include the condition that the public utility or
public utility district pay to the Grantee any and all actual and necessary costs incurred by the
Grantee in permitting such use and shall pay an annual fee per attachment which is equal to that
which the Grantee pays to the public electric service utility in the service area for such use and

Grantee may construct and install its cables, wires and other facilities from the same poles and
subject to the provisions of Section 17.01.108 ("Erection of Poles"), may place additional poles
as technically required.
2. With respect to any cables, wires, and other like facilities constructed and installed by a Grantee
above ground, the Grantee shall, at its sole expense, reconstruct and install such cables, wires,
or other facilities underground pursuant to any project under which the cables, wires, or other like
facilities of such utilities are placed underground within an area. The duty of Grantee to place its
cables, wires, and other facilities underground shall arise only if all like facilities of utilities which
are existing above ground are placed underground, provided however, Grantee is given
reasonable notice of such event so that it may place its facilities underground in conjunction with
the utility. All construction, reconstruction, and installation required under this Section, shall be
done at no cost to the City, except as provided for by law and/or entitlement.

those for the Cable Television System were installed at the same time, the entities may decide
among themselves who is to bear the cost of relocation; provided that the City shall not be liable
to a Grantee for such costs. Regardless of who bears the costs, Grantee shall take action to
remove or relocate upon reasonable notice at such time or times as are directed by the agency
or company undertaking the work. Reasonable advance written notice of not less than sixty (60)

1. Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the Cable System as necessary, as desirable, or as
required pursuant to the terms hereof within the City. However, at the effective date of this
Franchise, the Grantee was capable of providing service to ninety percent (90%) of the City
residents. Grantee shall develop the system such that ninety percent (90%) of the City residents
are always capable of being served by the Grantee. However, Grantee's obligation to maintain
the percentage shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
2. Whenever Grantee shall receive a request for service from at least fifteen (15) Subscribers within
1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall
extend its Cable System to such Subscriber at no cost to said Subscriber other than the usual
connection fees; provided that such extension is technically feasible, and will not adversely affect
the operation, financial condition, or market development of the Cable System, or as provided for
under the Section.
3. No Subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.
4. In the case of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed
underground, the developer or property owner shall give the Grantee reasonable notice of not
less than thirty (30) days prior to such construction or development, of the particular date on
which open trenching will be available for the Grantees installation of conduit, pedestals/or
vaults, and laterals to be provided at the Grantee's expense. The developer/property owner shall
also provide specifications in conformance with City requirements as needed for trenching. The
developer/property owner may close the requisite trenches when:
a. The Grantee has placed the necessary conduit; or
b. Seven (7) days after the developer/property owner has given a second notice that the
requisite trench has been opened; or
c. The Grantee has waived its right to place its facilities under this provision, whichever
comes sooner.
5. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by
the developer/property owner. Where such trenching is so provided by the developer/property
owner, the extension standards in this Section will be reduced to eleven (11) residents
requesting service within one quarter (¼) mile.

6. For unusual circumstances, such as a Subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground,
existence of more than one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance from distribution cable to
connection of service to Subscriber, or a density of less than fifteen (15) Subscribers per 1320
cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, Cable Service or other service may be
made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of
material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution
to be borne by Grantee and Subscribers in the area in which Cable Service may be expanded,
Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied
by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential Subscribers per 1320 cablebearing
stand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals fifteen (15)
Subscribers. Potential Subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on
a pro rata basis. Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential Subscribers be paid in advance.

governmental building, including but not limited to fire stations, police substations, the Surf-n-Swim
building, and public and non-profit private school buildings that are passed by its Cable System. The
outlets of basic and expanded basic service shall not be used to sell Cable Services in or throughout
such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in common or public areas open to the public. Grantee
shall have the right to secure any and all of its signals to insure compliance with this provision and to
insure compliance with its contractual agreements with its programming suppliers. The distribution of the
cable facility inside such building and the extent thereof shall be the option, duty and expense of the
building owner. Users of such outlets shall hold Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims
arising out of their use of such outlets, including but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to provide an
outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to the building exceeds two hundred
(200) cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and so long as it will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the Cable System to do so, or unless the building owner
agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of two hundred (200) cable feet. In the
event that additional outlets are provided to such buildings, the building owner may also be required to
pay the service fees and installation charges associated with the provision of all service(s) provided for
on the additional outlets relating thereto.

other approvals and pay such fees and deposit such security as required by applicable ordinance
of the City, shall conduct and complete the work of removal in compliance with all such
applicable ordinances, and shall restore the streets to the same condition they were in before the

is delayed, the Grantor will be fully informed of the reasons for the delay and the projected time
of completion and the Grantee may request an extension of the completion date. The Grantee
shall not be required to supply any service if the provision of such a service subjects the Grantee
to regulation by any governmental agency as a utility or common carrier.

permitted in 47 C.F.R. 76.985. The Capital Contribution will be payable by Grantee to the City after; a)
the approval of the City, if required to the inclusion of the Capital Contribution on Subscribers' bills
including any required approval pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933; b) notice to Grantee's Subscribers of the
inclusion; and c) the collection of the Capital Contribution by the Grantee from its Subscribers. Each

the capital cost to provide such an Institutional Network in full or in part, from the Grantor, at the
Grantor's discretion, or the Grantee may treat any such unrecovered capital costs as external Franchise

17.01.134.1 Conditions Of Sale
If a renewal or extension of the Grantee's Franchise is denied, or the Franchise is lawfully terminated,
and the Grantor either lawfully acquires ownership of the Cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at
the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act.
The Grantee and the Grantor agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the
Franchise, at the Grantee's request, which shall be made in its sole discretion, the Grantee shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. The
Grantor further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize the Grantee to continue to
operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization
exceed a period of time greater than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the
end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its Cable
System which is reasonably acceptable to the Grantor, the Grantee and the Grantor may avail
themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that the
Grantee's continued operation of its Cable system during the six (6) month period shall not be deemed
to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the Grantor or the Grantee.

and veracity of the statement, and which identifies in detail the sources and amounts of Gross
Revenues received by a Grantee during the period for which the payment is made.
3. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact,
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any
claim which the City may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this
Section.

"external costs" as such term is used in 47 C.F.R. 76.922, and will be separately stated on

allowable by law, or should the statutory limit imposed by Section 11-16-1 et seq., Utah Code (as
amended), or any successor provision, is increased above six percent (6%), the Grantee shall
upon request of the City, enter into a amendment to this Franchise, increasing the Franchise Fee
to the level requested by the City, but not to exceed the increased statutory limit, nor shall the
Franchise Fee paid be unduly discriminatory towards the Grantee or its customers, solely
because of their status as such.
6. At any time during the term of this Franchise, the City may require that the Grantee change,
either decrease or increase, the Franchise Fee percentage, so long as such change in Franchise
Fees does not exceed the allowable amount permitted by law. The City shall give the Grantee

including any required approval pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933; (b) notice to the Grantee's
Subscribers of the change.

2.2 Company Duty to Relocate. Whenever the City shall, in the interest of the public convenience,
necessity, health, safety, and general welfare, require the relocation or reinstallation of any property of
the Company or its successors, in any of the streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or public property of the City,
it shall be the obligation of the Company, upon notice of such requirement, to promptly commence work
to remove, relocate, or reinstall such property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the
requirements of the City. Such relocation, removal, or reinstallation by the Company shall be at no cost
to the City. Before requiring a relocation of electric facilities, the City shall, with the assistance and
consent of the Company, identify a reasonable alignment for the relocated electric facilities within the
Public Ways of the City. Any money and all rights of reimbursement from the State of Utah or the federal
government, to which the Company may be entitled for work done by the Company pursuant to this
paragraph, shall be the property of the Company. City shall assign or otherwise transfer to the Company
all rights it may have to recover costs for such work performed by the Company and shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company's efforts to obtain reimbursement.
2.3 Relocation for Private Development. The Company shall not be obligated to pay the cost of any
relocation that is required or made a condition of a private development. If the removal or relocation of
facilities is caused directly or otherwise by an identifiable development of property in the area, or is
made for the convenience of a customer, the Company may charge the expense of removal or
relocation to the developer or customer. For example, the Company shall not be required to pay
relocation costs in connection with a road widening or realignment where the road project is made a
condition or caused by a private development.
2.4 City Duty to Obtain Approval to Move Company Property; Emergency. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the City shall not, without the prior written approval of the Company, intentionally alter, remove,
relocate, or otherwise interfere with any Company facilities. However, if it becomes necessary (in the
judgment of the City Manager, City Engineer, Chief of the Fire Department, or Chief of the Police
Department) to cut or move any of the wire cables, appliances, or other fixtures of the Company
because of a fire, emergency, disaster, or imminent threat thereof, these acts may be done without prior
written approval of the Company, and the repairs thereby rendered necessary, shall be made by the
Company without charge to the City, but the Company shall not be precluded from making a claim
against any third party who may have caused said damage for the cost of such repairs. Any written
approval required by this Section, shall be promptly reviewed and processed by the Company and
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld.
2.5 Subdivision Plat Notification. Before the City grants final approval to any new subdivision, the City
shall submit the plat for review to the Company. Upon final approval of the plat, the City shall mail
notification of such approval and a copy of the final plat to the Company:

replacement was made necessary as a direct result of the operations of the Company, the Company
shall restore or repair, at the expense of the Company, any fence, grass, soil, shrubbery, bushes,
flowers, other low level vegetation, sprinkler system, irrigation system, gravel, flat concrete, or asphalt
damaged or displaced, provided, however, the Company shall not be obligated under this Section to

the Company extend to any subcontractor or independent contractor that the Company might employ to
perform the tasks outlined in this Section.

by applicable state law and regulations, the Company shall, upon payment of all charges provided in its
tariffs or their equivalent, place newly constructed electric distribution lines underground as may be
required by City ordinance.
3.4 City Use of Company Trenches. Whenever the Company proposes to install new underground
conduits or replace existing underground conduits within or under the Public Ways of the City, it shall
notify the Director of Public Works as soon as practical and shall allow the City, at its own expense and
without charge by the Company, to share the trench of the Company to lay its own conduit therein;
provided that such action by the City will not unreasonably interfere with the Company's facilities or
delay the accomplishment of the project.
3.5 Permitting. The Company shall have the right to excavate the Public Ways subject to reasonable
conditions and requirements of the City. Except in the case of an emergency, the Company shall, prior
to commencing new construction or major reconstruction work in the Public Way or street or other public
places, apply for a permit from the City, which permit shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. The Company will abide by all applicable ordinances and all reasonable rules, regulations, and
requirements of the City, and the City may inspect the manner of such work and require remedies as
may be necessary to assure compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
obligated to obtain a permit to perform emergency repairs.
3.6 Compliance with Pollution Laws. The Company shall continue to use its best efforts to take
measures that will result in its facilities within the City, meeting the standards required by applicable

City with a status report of such measures.
3.7 Incorporation of Technology. The Company shall use its best efforts to incorporate technological
advances into its equipment and service when such advances have been shown to be technically and
economically feasible, safe, and beneficial. For this purpose, Company shall, in the regular course of its
business, review technological advances that have occurred in the electric utility industry.
3.8 Extension of Service to City Facilities; Waiver of Advance Payment. The Company, upon receipt of
City's authorization for payment and construction, shall extend within the City, its facilities to provide
electric service to the City for municipal uses, and to the extent permitted by the Public Service
Commission, shall not require the City to make advance payments.
3.9 Use of Company Corridors. The City may identify portions of the transmission corridors, which the
Company now or in the future owns in fee within the City, as being desirable locations for public parks,
playgrounds, or recreation areas. In such event and upon notice by the City, the Company and the City
will negotiate in good faith, to reach an agreement providing for such uses by the City. However, no such
use will be allowed where the Company, in good faith, believes such use would interfere with the
Company's use of the transmission corridor or materially prejudice its interests in safety. The Company
shall assume no liability nor shall it incur, directly or indirectly, any additional expense in connection
therewith.

adjoin the Public Ways.
3.12 Repair Damage. If, during the course of work on its facilities, the Company causes damage to or
alters any Public Way or public property, the Company shall (at its own cost and expense and in a
manner approved by the City's Director of Public Works) replace and restore it in as good a condition as
existed before the work commenced. Except in case of an emergency, the Company shall, prior to
commencing work in the Public Ways, make application for a permit to perform such work from the office
of the City Engineer or other agency designated by the City. Such permit shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Company will abide by all reasonable regulations and requirements of the City Engineer
and ordinances pertaining to such work(s).
3.13 Guarantee of Repairs. For a period of one (1) year following the completion of the repair work
performed pursuant to paragraphs 3.2 and 3.12, the Company shall maintain, repair, and keep in good
condition, those portions of said Public Ways or private property restored, repaired, or replaced, to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer; provided however, that acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld.
3.14 Safety Standards. The Company's work, while in progress, shall be properly protected at all times
with suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices as are reasonably required by applicable
safety regulations or standards imposed by law and City standards established by the City Engineer.

the branches or limbs or other part of such trees or vegetation from interfering with the
Company's Electrical Facilities. Such pruning shall comply with the American National Standard
for Tree Care Operation (ANSI A300) and be conducted under the direction of an arborist
certified with the International Society of Arboriculture. A growth inhibitor treatment may be used
for trees and vegetation species that are fast growing and problematic. Nothing contained in this
Section shall prevent the Company, when necessary and with the approval of the owner of the
property on which they may be located, from cutting down and removing any trees which
overhang streets.
(b) The Company shall make a reasonable best effort, including written notice, to notify owners of
property adjacent to the trees to be trimmed at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to doing the

and suitable overhead structures owned by the Company within Public Ways for City wires used in
connection with its fire alarms, police signal systems, or other communication lines used for
governmental purposes; provided however, any such uses shall be for activities owned, operated, or
used by the City for a public purpose, and shall not include the provision of CATV, internet, or similar
services to the public. Provided further, that the Company shall assume no liability nor shall it incur
directly or indirectly, any additional expense in connection therewith, and the use of said poles and
structures by the City shall be in such a manner as to prevent safety hazards or interference with the
Company's use of same. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the Company to increase pole
size or alter the manner in which the Company attaches its equipment to poles, or alter the manner in
which it operates and maintains its electric facilities. City attachments shall be installed and maintained
in accordance with the reasonable requirements of the Company and the current addition of the National
Electrical Safety Code pertaining to such construction. Further, City attachments shall be attached or
installed only after written approval by the Company.
4.2 Limitation on Use Rights. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require the Company to
increase pole capacity, alter the manner in which the Company attaches equipment to the poles, or alter
the manner in which it operates and maintains its equipment. Such City attachments shall be installed
and maintained in accordance with the reasonable requirements of the Company and the then current
National Electrical Safety Code pertaining to such construction. Further, said City attachments shall be
attached or installed only after written approval by the Company, which approval will be timely
processed and will not be unreasonably withheld.
4.3 Maintenance of City Facilities. The City's use rights also shall be subject to the parties reaching an
agreement regarding maintenance of such City attachments, to be done either for a reasonable fee by
the Company or by a qualified party who shall fully indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any
liability and whose service would not materially prejudice the Company's interests in safety and

structures, upon reasonable terms and conditions to be agreed upon by the Company and such other
holders of a franchise from the City. The Company shall assume no liability nor shall it incur, directly or
indirectly, any additional expense in connection therewith. The use of said poles and structures by the
City or others holding a franchise from the City, shall be in such a manner as not to constitute a safety
hazard or to unreasonably interfere with the Company's use of the same.
4.5 Notification. Before commencing any street improvements or other work within a Public Way that
may affect the Company's electric facilities, the City shall notify the Company.

DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS; DIRECTOR OF FINANCE
6.1 City Representative. Except as provided in subparagraph 6.3 and 6.4, hereof, the Director of Public
Works ("Director") or his/her designee, or such other person as the City Manager may designate, is
hereby designated the official of the City having full power and authority to take appropriate action for
and on behalf of the City and its inhabitants to enforce the provisions of this Franchise and to investigate
any alleged violations or failures of the Company to comply with said provisions or to adequately and
fully discharge its responsibilities and obligations hereunder. The failure or omission of the City

6.2 Company Duty to Cooperate. In order to facilitate such duties of the Director, the Company agrees:
(a) To allow the City Representative reasonable access to any part of the facilities, works, and
systems within the City. The Director may make and supervise reasonable tests to determine the
quality of the electric service supplied to the customers of the Company within the City, with
particular reference to the standards of service provided herein and in the Rules and Regulations
prescribed by, and the tariffs of the Company filed with the Public Service Commission from time

Commission, the Company, upon reasonable request, will provide the City access to all
documents provided other parties in connection with such proceeding.
6.3 City Financial Review. With regard to financially related matters, the City designates the Director of
Finance as the official of the City having full power and authority to take appropriate action for and on
behalf of the City and its inhabitants to enforce the provisions of this Franchise and investigate any

adequately discharge the responsibilities and obligations hereunder. The failure or omission of the

duties defined in paragraph 6.3 above, the Company agrees to grant the Director of Finance reasonable
access to the books and records of the Company insofar as they relate to any matters covered by this
Franchise; to provide the Director of Finance with such reasonable and necessary reports containing or
based on information readily obtainable from the Company's books and records as may be from time to
time requested, with respect to the electric service supplied under this Franchise; and to provide the
Director of Finance, upon request not more than every two (2) years, a list of utility related real property

of the terms and conditions of this Franchise by any failure of the other, or any of its officers, employees,
or agents, upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any such terms
and conditions.

ARTICLE VII
ELECTRICAL SERVICE
7.1 Duty to Supply Electricity. Subject to the terms of this Franchise Agreement, state law, and the terms
and conditions imposed by the Public Utilities Commission, the Company shall furnish electricity within
the corporate limits of the City, or any additions thereto, to the City and to the inhabitants thereof, and to
any person or persons or corporation doing business in the City or any additions thereto. The Company
shall at all times, take all reasonable and necessary steps to assure an adequate supply of electricity to
its customers at the lowest reasonable cost consistent with long term reliable supplies. If the supply of
electricity to its customers should be interrupted, the Company shall take all necessary and reasonable
actions to restore such supply at the soonest practicable time.
7.2 Company Duty to Reimburse for Upgraded Distribution. The Company shall reimburse the City for
the costs of upgrading the electrical distribution system or facility of any City building or facility where
such upgrading is caused or occasioned solely by the Company's decision to increase voltage of
delivered electrical energy.
7.3 Upgrading System. The Company will, from time to time during the term of this Franchise, make
such enlargements and extensions of its electric system as are necessary to adequately provide for the
requirements of the City and the inhabitants thereof. Such enlargements and extensions shall be made
in accordance with the Company's currently effective tariffs, the rules of the Public Service Commission,
and state law.
7.4 Promulgation of Rules for Company Operations. The Company, from time to time, may, in
accordance with the requirements of the Public Service Commission, promulgate such rules,
regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business, including the utilization of
electricity; and the interference with, or alteration of, any of the Company's property upon the premises
of its customers, as shall be necessary to insure a continuous and uninterrupted service to each and all
its customers and the proper measurement thereof. The Company shall keep all such matters on file in
its office in the City, available for public inspection and copying, and shall provide the City Recorder and
any other official of the City, as requested in writing by the City as requiring same in the discharge of his
duties, copies of the Company's currently effective tariffs, on file with and approved by the Public
Service Commission.
7.5 Supremacy of Lawful Public Service Commission Tariff Orders. The City and the Company
recognize that the lawful provisions of the Company's tariffs on file and in effect with the Public Service
Commission that are consistent with the restrictions and limitations of the Utah Constitution regarding
the rights of municipalities to franchise, are controlling over any inconsistent provision in this Franchise
dealing with the same subject matter. In the opinion of both the Company and the City, no provision of
this Franchise is inconsistent with any of the currently effective provisions of the Company's tariffs. In the
event that either the Public Service Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission makes
any proposal that would directly affect the Company, and that in the Company's opinion would be
inconsistent with any provision of this Franchise, the Company, upon becoming aware of such proposal,
will exercise its best efforts to consult with representatives of the City in a timely manner regarding such
proposal; provided, however, that the position ultimately taken by the Company of any such proposal,
shall be determined solely by the Company.
7.6 City's Right to Lowest Charge. No charges to the City by the Company for any service or supply
shall exceed the lowest charge for similar or identical service or supplies provided by the Company to
any other similarly situated customer or consumer of the Company.

Layton City in the form approved by the City Attorney; otherwise, this Franchise Agreement and any
ordinance adopted relating thereto and all rights granted hereunder shall be null and void.

The Community and Economic Development Director, upon recommendation of the Fire Department,
the Police Department, and Engineering Division of the Public Works Department may require the
construction of street calming facilities within the new proposed developments
The criteria on which such a determination will be made are:
1. The width of the roadway;
2. The nature of the land use abutting the roadway;
3. The nature of the roadway, such as whether it is a through street, the distance between any
curves in the roadway, the existing or proposed design features that would affect traffic flow, its
location with reference to roadways designed for a higher carrying capacity, its potential for use
as an alternate route from larger roadways, etc.; and
4. The City's experience with roads of a similar nature and the speed and volume on similar
situated roadways.
Methods to be used for this purpose include, but are not limited to, rotaries (also known as
"roundabouts" or "turnabouts"), traffic circles, narrowing roadways at intersections and crosswalks, use
of designed protrusions which narrow the roadway or redirect traffic, raised medians, etc.
Upon a continuing review of the City's traffic patterns, the City may design and install these devices on
existing roadways based upon the same criteria set forth above.

a. An activity or condition that is causing imminent peril to persons, property, facilities, or the
general welfare of the City;

will likely result in causing said imminent peril, or creating a condition that would be a
substantial detriment to the remainder of the development specifically or the City
generally;
c. Persistent violations, that singularly may be easily correctable and not creating a perilous
condition, which would bring into question the integrity of the work, the potential failure of
which would cause damage to persons, property, facilities, or the general welfare of the
City. For purposes of this Subsection "violations" means activity or conditions that either
are contrary to codes, regulations, laws, conditions of approval, or agreements, or do not

3. Notification. Upon determining to issue a "Stop Work" order, the authorized person will provide
verbal notice to the "on site" or assigned manager of the development, and will post a written
notice thereof in a conspicuous location or locations that would provide reasonable notice to
those entering the development. A written notice will be provided to said manager as soon as is

withdraw the "Stop Work" order.
4. Appeals. If a developer disagrees with any portion of the "Stop Work" order, the developer may
appeal said order to the authorized person's division or department director. The division or
department director is authorized to amend, modify, withdraw, or expand the order. The division
or department director should respond to the appeal within one (1) business day. If the developer
desires to appeal the decision of the division or department director, that appeal shall be in
writing, submitted to the City Manager or the City Manager's designee. The response to that
appeal should be within two (2) business days.

order without the direct authorization of the City.
Such violations are class B misdemeanors and are punishable as such.

19.04.020 Purpose Of Zoning Districts
In addition to the general purposes of this Title identified in Section 19.01.040, the various zoning districts each
serve a more specific individual purpose, as described below:
1. The "A" (agricultural) zoning district is established to provide areas for agricultural and related uses, along
with very low density residential uses. This designation shall be applied to land with appropriate
topographic conditions, where the intrusion of urban uses would be inappropriate or untimely, due to lack
or need of urban services and facilities.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=19_Zoning 27/193
2. The "R" (residential) zoning districts are created to provide for a range of densities which will reflect the
diverse needs and desires of the people of Layton City. These zoning districts shall also allow for other
compatible uses which may complement the primarily residential function of the district, under certain
conditions. Basic urban services and utilities should be available in all of these zoning districts; however,
some R-S zoning districts may not meet this standard:
a. The "R-S" zoning district is intended to provide area for very low density, suburban-type uses. It
may, provided adequate lot area exists, include farm animals.
b. The "R-1" zoning district is intended to provide areas for single family attached and detached
dwellings of a low density.
c. The "R-2" zoning district is intended to provide areas for low density single family detached and
attached dwellings and two-family dwellings.
d. The "R-MH" zoning district is intended to provide areas for mobile home parks and mobile home
subdivisions to develop at a low density. Because of the required size of these developments,
they should be located adjacent to an arterial or collector street.
e. The "R-M" zoning districts are intended to provide areas for multi-family attached dwellings at
medium to high-medium densities. Single family dwellings are also allowed in these zoning
districts. These zoning districts shall be located adjacent arterial streets and, in some
circumstances, major collector streets.
f. The "R-H" zoning district is intended to provide areas for high density, multi-family residential
dwellings. Single family dwellings are also allowed in these zoning districts. These zoning districts
shall be located adjacent to arterial streets.
3. The "B-RP" (business and research park) zoning district is intended to be an attractive environment for
offices, research facilities, and environmentally appropriate assembly uses as well as appropriate
amenities supporting employee activity. Uses receiving site plan approval for this zoning district should be
compatible with surrounding uses and integrated so that all development creates an open campus like
atmosphere. This is to be accomplished with a number of design components including attractive
buildings, meandering walks, and well thought out generous landscaping.
4. The "PB" (professional business) zoning district is intended to provide area for offices and institutions in
which the intensity of use, in terms of hours of operation and number of customers, is less than that of a
commercial zoning district. These zoning districts should be located along arterial or collector streets,
abutting adjacent residential neighborhoods which would patronize these uses.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=19_Zoning 28/193
5. The "C" (commercial) zoning districts are intended to provide area for commercial uses based on
considerations such as: the intensity of the use, goods and services provided, and the market area. In all
cases, these zoning districts shall abut an arterial or major collector street.
a. The "CP-1" (planned neighborhood commercial) zoning district is intended to provide commercial
services to an area of limited size, for basic trade and personal services which occur regularly or
frequently. The major market area for this zoning district is the adjacent residential areas. This
type of zoning district should be located at the intersection of arterial or collector streets. It
services both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
b. The "CP-2" (planned community commercial) zoning district is to provide a range of commercial
uses greater than that of the CP-1, but at a lower intensity than a regional commercial zoning
district. The basic market for this zoning district is vehicular-oriented and the major market area is
Layton City. This type of zoning district is best located at the intersection of arterial streets.
c. The "CP-3" (planned regional commercial) zoning district is to provide an area in which a full
range of commercial and professional uses may locate in a limited area. The limited area of this
zoning district functions to heighten the intensity of use, concentrate activity, and make it a
community focal point. These zoning districts should abut major arterial streets and be located
near freeway access, as well as mass transit lines.
d. The "C-H" (planned highway commercial) zoning district is intended to provide area abutting major
arterial streets for a full range of commercial and professional uses; however, the primary focus
should be on uses which require large retail display or merchandise storage areas and serve a
regional market.
6. The "M" (manufacturing/industrial) zoning districts are intended to provide area for manufacturing and
industrial uses, where they will have the necessary services and facilities, and minimize obtrusions by
adjoining uses and zoning districts. These zoning districts shall be located near rail lines and shall be
near Interstate Highway interchanges for ease of transportation of goods. In order to minimize conflict
among incompatible uses, most non-industrial uses are not allowed in the "M" zoning districts.
a. The "M-1" (light manufacturing/industrial) zoning district is intended to provide area for
manufacturing and industrial development with less intensive use. The largest portion of these
types of uses shall be contained inside of structures. These zoning districts should be located
near major arterial streets and be located so as to provide easy access to the Interstate Highway
system. Because of the highly visible locations of these uses, special attention shall be paid to
visual aesthetics.
b. The "M-2" (heavy manufacturing/industrial) zoning district is intended to provide area for heavy
manufacturing and industrial development. These uses shall be located near major arterials and
located so as to provide easy access to the Interstate Highway system. Proximity to rail lines may
also be a determinant in locating these zoning districts.
7. The "MU" (Mixed-Use) zoning district is intended to provide areas that may combine commercial or retail
uses with multi-family residential uses within buildings, or within close proximity to other uses along a
corridor or within a walkable district.
8. The "DO-1" (Mixed-Use Design Overlay) zoning district is intended to define specific areas within the MU
zoning district where a height greater than three (3) stories and up to five (5) stories is desired. The DO-1
zoning district includes provisions for appropriate height transitions and buffers to ensure compatibility
with off-site single family residential uses.
9. The "MU-TOD" (Mixed-Use - Transit Oriented Development) zoning district is intended to provide
locations for mixed-use developments with convenient pedestrian access to jobs, shopping,
entertainment, and multiple-family residential housing within close proximity to public transportation
facilities.

other recreational facilities providing that in all such cases, the following conditions are met:
a. The facilities shall be owned and maintained by the members; and
b. A minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the membership must be residents of the
neighborhood or section of the subdivision.
2. Yard space for one building only. No required yard or other open space around an existing building or
which is hereafter provided around any building, for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this
Title, shall be considered as providing yard or open space for any other building; nor shall any yard or
other open space on an adjoining lot be considered as providing a yard or open space on a lot whereon a
building is to be erected or established; nor shall side yards or required width of any lot be acquired by
purchase or other means by making substandard the side yards or width of any adjacent lot. No space
needed to meet the width, depth, yard, area, parking or other requirements of this Title for lot or building
may be sold or leased away from such lot or building.
3. Every dwelling on a lot. Every dwelling structure shall be located and maintained on a separate lot
having no less than the minimum area, width, depth and frontage required by this Title for the zoning
district in which the dwelling structure is located, except that group dwelling complexes and planned
residential unit developments (PRUDs), or other more flexible requirements as permitted by this Title,
may vary from this requirement.
4. Reduction in lot size permitted. No parcel of land, which has less than the minimum width frontage, and
area requirements for a building lot for the zoning district in which it is located, may be cut off, placed
under separate deed, or sold from a larger parcel of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of
building or development as a building lot unless a variance is granted by the Land Use Appeal Authority
as per Section 19.18.070 of this Title.
5. Lot standards. Except for more flexible requirements such as those pertaining to planned residential unit
developments (PRUDs), group dwellings, or as may be otherwise provided in this Title, every lot within
the City shall have such area and the required frontage upon a dedicated public or approved private
street, as is required by this Title, before a building permit may be issued.
6. Approval of culinary water supply and sewage disposal required. Where either a supply of piped
water under pressure, approved for use by the municipality or a connection to an approved sanitary
sewer system is not available, no building permit shall be issued for main buildings, or other buildings
which would utilize such facilities until the proposed plan for sewage disposal and the proposed source of
water supply has been approved by the Davis County Board of Health and Layton City.
7. No obstructions in flood plain. No building, structure, fence, or other obstruction may be constructed
within any portion of "Zone A" as defined on the FEMA Flood Insurance Map. No such flood plains as
defined by FEMA, may be otherwise reduced in effectiveness in any manner by the dumping of garbage,
other refuse, or earth, or by leveling or obliterating it otherwise.
8. Use of solar energy encouraged. The use of active and passive solar energy is encouraged for use in
developments where such technology would be appropriate. A property owner may either purchase or
receive as a gift, solar rights from another property owner. Such transactions should be recorded with the
Davis County Recorder's Office.

12. Substandard lots. The requirements of this Title as to minimum lot area or lot width shall not be
construed to prevent the use for a single-unit dwelling on any lot or parcel of land in the event that such
lot has been held in separate ownership since adoption of these regulations, being May 5, 1983, and
complied with zoning regulations in effect prior to that date.
13. Front setback transition - Increase, reduction.
a. The front setback required for a building on an inside lot may be reduced where a main building
with a nonconforming front set back exists on any lot adjacent thereto, within the same block
frontage, to the extent that the average of the front setback of the existing building and the
required front setback is maintained. Where one main building exists on each lot adjacent thereto,
the front setback for a proposed building on the inside lot may be the average of the setbacks of
existing buildings.
b. Building lots adjacent to arterial roadways, and on which residential dwelling structures were
constructed at the time when the required setback from the arterial roadway was thirty feet (30'),
will retain the thirty foot (30') setback as the development requirement for said lot.
c. Where, within the same block frontage, property is zoned partly for residential and partly for
commercial or industrial use, or where any part of the block is so zoned as to require a front
setback, the front setback required for the most restricted portion of the block shall be required for
the entire frontage of the block on that street.
14. Side setback reduction.

smaller width than required in the zoning district in which it is located, each side setback and the
total side setback requirements shall be not less than the same percentage of the width of the lot
as the required setback would be of the required width of the lot, provided that on corner lots, no
side setback shall be permitted which is less than four feet (4'), and on inside lots the side setback
shall be not less than four feet (4') on one side and ten feet (10') on the other. All fractions of a
foot resulting from the calculation required shall be resolved to the closest one-half foot (½'). The
side yard on a street shall not be reduced to less than twenty feet (20').

such addition shall not extend the depth of the building, existing on the effective date of the
regulations codified herein which is May 5, 1983, more than fifty percent (50%). Any enlargement
made in excess of the above shall maintain the side setback required for new buildings in the
zone in which it is located.
c. Side yard limitations. Access to the rear yard must be preserved through at least one (1) side
yard.
15. Lot, inside gore-shaped: Where such lot is a gore-shaped lot, and the side lot lines thereof converge
either to a point or to a rear boundary which is less than one-half (½) of the minimum required lot width,
the rear lot line shall be construed to be an imaginary straight line crossing the centerline of the lot, at
right angles, which is one-half (½) of the required lot width in length. (See Diagram A-3.)
a. Lot, corner classified as gore: For the purpose of locating a dwelling thereon, an owner of a
corner lot may have the option of classifying such lot as a gore-shaped inside lot in which case the

Each step should be followed in the order outlined.
1. Meet with Development Staff to determine the feasibility of the development and review the Sensitive
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=19_Zoning 62/193
Lands Overlay Map to determine if the site is in the overlay area and if it is, what hazards may be
associated with the site. If the site is outside of the overlay area, the process outlined in Title 18 will be
followed, excepting PRUD's which will follow the process outlined in Chapter 19.08. If it is subsequently
determined that the site is within the sensitive lands overlay or the site has geologic hazards that are not
shown on the map the review process will be pursuant to this Chapter.
Building permits on single lots, whether or not in platted subdivisions, which are in the sensitive lands
overlay area will follow the outline through this Section up to paragraph 5 after which the building permit
may be issued administratively after it is determined that the lot can be developed in accordance with the
intent of this Chapter.
If the development is considered a small subdivision, as defined in Chapter 18.48, then the process
outlined in that Chapter will be followed after a complete geotechnical review is performed as outlined in
this Section.
If the only hazard associated with the site is high liquefaction then the applicant must submit a soils report
with recommendations for control of subsurface water as well as footing and foundation design after
which the proposal will follow the process outlined in Chapter 18.12.
2. A scope of work must be submitted by a qualified consultant that will address all hazards associated with
the site and how each hazard will be evaluated.
3. The City and its geologic consultants will review the scope of work to determine if the methods outlined
are designed to produce the necessary information.

b. An estimate of the average slope of the proposed subdivision generally, and the slope of any
individual steeper lots than that average;
c. The number of lots;
d. The location and size of proposed lots;
e. Location, width, and grade of all proposed streets, and radii of any cul-de-sac;
f. Location of existing or proposed schools, churches, or parks; and
g. Soil/geologic report that addresses all items in the approved scope of work and if applicable
recommendations by a qualified geotechnical engineer. Reports shall be site specific and identify
all geologic hazards, whether on or off-site, if it affects the particular property including the
following hazard(s):
i. Flood history and potential; proximity to known canals, lakes, streams and alluvial fan
flooding;
ii. Definition of any zones of deformation with respect to active faults and recommended
setbacks therefrom;
iii. Evidence for other mass movement of soil and rock (landslides, debris flows, rock falls);
iv. Identification of anomalies of the terrain or characteristics of the geological materials which
would have any potential impact upon the use of site;
v. Determination of ground water characteristics;
vi. The report shall contain written recommendations for construction of structures and
avoidance or mitigation of the hazards. Land drains recommended for the purpose of
hillside drainage and dewatering to achieve slope stability through private property shall be
owned and maintained by a Home Owners Association or property owner, constructed to
Layton City standards, and shall be located within easement to ensure the long-term
maintenance and operation of the drains. This requirement shall not alleviate or substitute
the requirement for a land drain system located within the public right-of-way for footing
and foundation drains;

5. After the application is received by the Community and Economic Development Department, the geologic
and soil report will be reviewed by Development Staff and, if the report finds that geologic hazards exist,
the report will be reviewed by other geotechnical advisors which may include the Utah Geologic Survey
(UGS). If after review, the geotechnical advisors concur with the geologic and soil report and the
proposed remedial measures submitted by the applicant, the item will be forwarded to the Land Use
Authority for review for conceptual, annexation, or rezone approval, and the process will follow the outline
under Section 19.07.070. The required reports and the plans to address the concerns set forth in those
reports shall be stamped and approved by a licensed professional engineer. If the staff and/or their
advisors do not agree with the applicant's geologic and soils report, the following action may be taken:
a. Additional studies may be required to be performed.
b. The Development Staff and the City's geotechnical advisors review the submitted reports and
determine that a third party, selected by the City, should review the submitted studies at the cost
of the applicant. The third party should review the information that has been submitted.
Additional fieldwork will only be performed after consultation with the geotechnical advisors and
applicant and if it is determined to be necessary to make a determination.
c. On recommendation of the City's geotechnical advisors, the construction staff may determine that
the site cannot be developed and no further action is taken. An appeal from this decision can be
made to the Land Use Authority. Such an appeal must be in writing and submitted to the Planning
Department within thirty (30) days of the Development Staff decision.
The request will not be forwarded for annexation, rezone, or conceptual approval until the plans
provided, which were designed to address the geologic and soils issues, are stamped and
approved by a licensed professional engineer, which establish that the site can be developed in
accordance with the intent of this Title.

1. Land shall be classified as being in the PRUD overlay zone pursuant to an amendment to the zoning
ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 19.17 of the Layton Municipal Code provided,
however, in order to classify any land as being in the PRUD overlay zone the following conditions shall be
considered by the Land Use Authority with respect to such land
a. That the land has features which are compatible with clustering or other nonstandard
development; and
b. That the land has features which are compatible with the coordination and design of open spaces
and with the proposed housing development; and
c. That the classification is not in conflict with any applicable element of the Layton City General
Plan.
2. The PRUD concept is particularly encouraged when:
a. The land has unique and valuable natural, scenic, and environmental features such as wetlands,
ridge lines, canyons, slopes, etc.; and
b. Such land will be better preserved and enhanced by integrated planning and design as a whole,
pursuant to the provisions of the PRUD overlay zone, than under conventional zoning regulations.
3. The Land Use Authority, may classify certain areas of the City as being in the PRUD overlay zone in
order to ensure that future residential development will be compatible with the sensitive lands and natural
features of the area. Sensitive lands and natural features shall include, but not be limited to canyons and
slopes, ridge lines, streams or other natural water features, wetlands, geologically sensitive areas, and
prime agricultural land.
4. Land included in the PRUD overlay zone shall be designated on the Official Zoning Map of Layton City
with the symbol (PRUD) following the underlying zoning district designation of such land.

3. In addition to permitted residential and recreational uses, a PRUD may provide offices and professional
service uses in a planned environment. Where a PRUD proposes a mix of residential and office uses, the
Land Use Authority should make the following findings as part of the approved Preliminary PRUD Plan:
a. The proposed PRUD will provide a pleasant and attractive environment in which the relationship
of land uses is properly planned to assure a harmonious development;
b. The proposed PRUD will create no detriment to adjacent properties or to the general area in which
it is located; and that it will be in harmony with the characteristics of the community and the
existing development in the area; and
c. That the proposed PRUD will provide for the efficient utilization of land and the open space is in
reasonable proportion to residential densities and the intensity of office and professional service
uses.
4. In considering non-residential land uses as part of a PRUD plan, the Land Use Authority shall address the
following:
a. Size of project. The proposed PRUD must propose a minimum of fifty (50) units in order for the
Land Use Authority to consider office, professional service and smaller format retail uses as part
of the PRUD plan. Office and professional service uses shall not occupy more than ten percent
(10%) of the PRUD project site.
b. Architecture. The proposed non-residential structures should be complementary to the
surrounding and historic architecture in terms of scale, massing, roof shape, exterior materials,
etc. New buildings should not create large bulky masses, but should be scaled down into
groupings of smaller attached structures.
c. Building Height. Buildings should be limited to two (2) stories or thirty-five feet (35').
d. Parking. Large expanses of asphalt should be reduced and broken into smaller parking lots.
Parking lots should include ample landscaping to buffer cars from neighboring properties.
e. Access. Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access must be provided. Access from an arterial or
collector street to the office and professional service uses must be provided. A traffic impact study
shall be required, as part of the preliminary PRUD plan, to project auto and truck traffic generated
by the uses proposed. The traffic impact study must be prepared by a registered traffic engineer.
The traffic study shall include an analysis of on-site circulation, capacities of existing streets,
number of additional trips which will be generated, origin/destination studies and peak traffic
generation movements.
f. Rooflines. Flat or low-pitched roofs should be avoided and rooflines should blend in with
surrounding and historic buildings.
g. Materials. New buildings should blend with the materials of surrounding and historic buildings.
h. Signage. Signage for the non-residential buildings should be part of a coordinated signage
system for the entire PRUD project. Signage should help unify the project and provide a positive
image. Natural materials such as wood, stone, rock, and metal with external illumination are
encouraged. The size and location of signage shall conform to the requirements and guidelines for
monument signage from Sections 20.04.100 and 20.04.110 of the Layton Municipal Code.
i. Lighting. Outdoor lighting should be screened by shields or hoods to prevent glare onto adjacent
properties. The intensity of larger fixtures should be reduced by utilizing a larger number of
smaller light poles of twelve to eighteen feet (12' - 18'). Incandescent lights should be used in
smaller pedestrian spaces where quality light is especially important. In addition to these
guidelines, plan and specifications for all exterior lighting installed adjacent to residential areas
shall be submitted for approval as outlined in Section 19.06.010 of the Layton Municipal Code.
j. Buffers. A buffer between residential and non-residential uses within and adjacent to the PRUD
shall be a minimum of at least sixty feet (60'). Said buffer may include open space areas,
pedestrian trails and landscaped areas and may be counted toward the base open space
requirement for the PRUD project.

19.08.090 Application Of PRUD To Underlying Zoning District
1. Upon combining the PRUD overlay zone with an appropriate existing zoning district, variations from the
development standards of the underlying zone may be permitted and approved by the Land Use
Authority. Variations, however, shall not include changes in the uses allowed by the zoning district with
which the PRUD zone has been combined, except as permitted by 19.08.080.
2. The Land Use Authority may, in the process of approving Preliminary PRUD Plat, approve the variations
from the minimum standards of the underlying zone where there is sufficient evidence that the variations
will not adversely affect neighboring property and that the designation standards of Section 19.08.100 are
met.
3. Reduction of setbacks or other open space shall be compensated by providing additional open space in
other appropriate areas of the development and shall be in keeping with accepted land use planning
principles.

the PRUD is calculated by adding up the number of units allowed by each zoning district, with the
applicable density bonus. However, the dwelling units may be placed without regard to zoning district
boundaries.
6. When topography would dictate a lower density than the base residential density of the underlying zoning
district, a density analysis, specific to the site, shall determine the base density for the PRUD.
7. The base residential density and the maximum forty percent (40%) density bonus shall be based on the
following:
Zoning District Base Density Density With 40% Bonus
A 1 unit per acre 1.4 units per acre
R-S 2.5 units per acre 3.5 units per acre

10. Required "base" open space shall be areas that are not occupied by buildings, structures, parking areas,
or streets. Such areas shall include:
a. The required peripheral buffer strip around the project of not less than twenty feet (20') in width,
containing trees and other horticulture plantings, which strip and plantings shall be required. The
periphery buffer strip along public street frontages shall be the same as that of the underlying
zoning district. The periphery buffer area may be modified where the building, fencing, and/or the
land between that building and the property line has been specifically designed to minimize
adverse impact through a combination of structural and landscape design techniques. The
periphery buffer strip may also include pathways. Berming may also be required if buffering,
needed separation, or safety would be enhanced;
b. Area between buildings and outside of platted lots;
c. Area with natural features worthy of preservation, which are not buildable, such as canyons or
slopes, ridge lines, wetlands, stream or creek corridors, utility corridors, wildlife habitat,
geologically sensitive areas, and significant views and vistas. Utility corridors shall only be
counted towards the open space requirement if improved as an accessible amenity to the project
or the community as a whole. This may be included in the peripheral buffer strip;
d. Significant agricultural lands worthy of preservation for continued agricultural use. These
preserved agricultural lands shall not be stripped of topsoil, and adequate irrigation and water
rights shall be preserved for the maintenance of these lands;
e. Open space and landscaped areas which are integrated into the site design of non-residential
uses approved as part of the PRUD plan and which are accessible by the residents of the project.
11. The base open space requirement in any residential zoning district may be reduced five percent (5%) if all
of the following conditions are met:
a. No additional density beyond the base in the zoning district is requested;
b. The street cross-section provides a street treatment which allows for more landscaping and better
separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic (beyond the typical public street);
c. The open space provided shall be integrated into the PRUD project and accessible to all residents
of the PRUD community via pedestrian corridors or via enhanced pedestrian systems, which
minimize the need to cross streets; and
d. All other aspects of the PRUD ordinance are complied with.
12. The base open space requirement in the single-family residential zoning districts may be reduced to thirty
percent (30%) for PRUDs where all of the dwelling units are detached, single-family structures.
13. The following criteria should be considered when granting a density bonus for additional open space:
a. The open space should be held in common via public ownership or by a homeowner's association
with a permanent open space easement;
b. The open space should be large enough for the use of all residents of the project or the general
public. Such spaces should include improvements such as playgrounds, pathways, pavilions, play
courts, ball fields, as well as informal spaces which encourage the use and enjoyment of the open
space. Such areas may include lands, which are buildable, such as prominent ridgelines, views
and vistas, and areas of significant native vegetation; or
c. Improved and accessible agricultural lands such as equestrian facilities, stables, etc. for the use of
area residents.

the responsibility of a homeowner's association; or
d. Through compliance with the provisions of the Condominium Ownership Act as outlined in Title 57
of the Utah Code, which provides for the payment of common expenses for the upkeep of
common areas and facilities.
e. In the event the common open space and other facilities are not maintained in a manner
consistent with the approved final PRUD plan, the City may at its option cause such maintenance
to be performed and assess the costs to the affected property owners or responsible association.
15. Any property reserved as open space and included in support of a density bonus, will not be considered
as an offset, credit, or contribution towards any applicable impact fee, regardless of whether the property
is used as a park, detention basin, etc.
16. Following final plat PRUD approval, any substantial changes in use, or arrangement of lots, blocks, and
building tracts, or any changes in the provision or type of common open spaces must be resubmitted for
final plat review and approval by the Land Use Authority.

lots with more than one hundred seventy-five feet (175') and less than two hundred fifty feet (250')
of frontage, two (2) driveways may be allowed by the Zoning Administrator.
b. No two (2) of these driveways shall be closer to each other than fifty feet (50'), and no driveway
shall be closer to a side lot line than twenty feet (20') except as granted by the Zoning
Administrator.
c. Driveways are to be located as approved by the City staff. In no case shall a driveway on an
arterial street, be located closer than eighty feet (80') from the point of intersection of the arterial or
any other street. For any local or collector street intersecting an arterial street, driveways on the
local or collector shall be a minimum of fifty feet (50') from the intersection. For all collector and
local streets, the minimum distance for a driveway from any intersection of such streets shall be
fifty feet (50'). Where a traffic signal either exists, or is anticipated at any street intersection, the
setback for any driveway from that intersection shall be a minimum of two hundred feet (200')
unless an exception is granted by the Zoning Administrator. The distance shall be measured from
the point of intersection of the two (2) converging front lot lines or of two (2) lines lying tangent to
and in the same direction as the front lot lines. No driveway shall be located across any curved
section of frontage lying between the point of intersection and the point of tangency.
d. Lots with frontages of one hundred fifty feet (150') or less are encouraged to share access to
streets with adjacent lots. Where this is feasible, the Zoning Administrator may require joint
access on any width lot(s). Where it is determined to be infeasible an exception may be granted
by the Zoning Administrator.
e. The design, location, and width of all driveways entering a state highway shall be done as
required by the Utah Department of Transportation. Approval of the driveway(s) shall be provided
to the City in writing prior to the issuance of any building permit.
2. Width of driveway. Each driveway shall have a width of not less than twenty feet (20') nor greater than
thirty-five feet (35') in width on local and collector streets. On City arterial streets the width shall not be
less than twenty-eight feet (28'), nor exceed forty feet (40') in width. The measurement of driveways shall
be taken at right angles to the centerline of the driveway at the front lot line and shall be from face to face
of the curb radii, or at a point a flared approach meets the typical location of the sidewalk.

3. The following design criteria shall be required:
a. All requirements of Sections 19.13.040 and 19.13.050, unless modified by any of the following
items:
b. Dedication and improvements of streets shall be made in accordance with the Master Street Plan,
plus any additional right-of-way or fee as may be determined by the City for special circumstances
where it is necessary to serve the vehicular and pedestrian needs of proposed development.
c. A minimum of ten percent (10%) of any CP-1, CP-2, CP-3, C-H, and PB commercial site, and
twenty-five percent (25%) of any B-RP commercial site, and thirty percent (30%) of a multiple
family residential site shall be landscaped. The landscaped buffer required along public streets by
the Layton Municipal Code may be included in computing the percentage of landscaping. Upon
request, landscaping requirements may be reduced by the City when, due to the size of the
parcel, the amount of landscaping required is unreasonable and cannot be located in useful
locations.
d. Landscaping shall be distributed throughout the project by placing landscaping along street
frontages, throughout parking areas and adjacent to service and delivery areas.
e. If more than fifty percent (50%) of the required parking for a development is located between the
structure and the public right-of-way, then there shall be an eight hundred (800) square foot
planter area for every twenty (20) parking stalls. Said planter(s) shall be irrigated and have a
minimum of two (2) trees and other horticultural plantings. Said planters shall be dispersed
throughout the parking area and not combined. This requirement is in addition to the minimum
required landscaping for the underlying zoning district.
Said requirements shall apply to developments with a minimum size of one (1) acre. On lots with
more than one (1) frontage, the above requirements shall apply to the street with the highest traffic
count, excluding any Interstate Highway.
f. For the purpose of buffering and site compatibility with surrounding development, commercial and
industrial projects may require additional landscaping and architectural integration. Landscaping
percentages and buffer strips may be increased to ensure compatibility. Site compatibility is
particularly important when commercial or industrial projects are developed adjacent to residential
and professional office zones.
g. Fencing may be required depending on the adjacent land use and the applicant's security needs.
Where visual barrier fencing containing wood, metal, plastic, or vinyl strips is either proposed by
the applicant or required by the City, such strips shall be properly secured. Screening of any
outside storage shall be required if appropriate, with a combination of fencing, walls, live plants,
and/or earth berming. Fences shall be constructed so that significant variations in top line, bottom
line, and/or height does not occur due to erratic grading of the site.
h. Exterior masonry. Masonry will be required on the exterior of all developments. The minimum
area (A) of masonry required (measured in square feet) will be determined by multiplying the
outside perimeter (P) of the foundation (measured in feet), by four feet (4') as follows:
P x 4 = A
The percentage of masonry used can be as a wainscot around the periphery of the building or a
higher percentage at the main entrance(s). Corner lots and lots on arterial streets are required to
use the majority of the masonry on the front and sides of the building facing streets.
i. Alternative materials other than masonry may be used with the approval of the Zoning
Administrator only upon finding that the proposed building design will create a more attractive
project.
7/17/2019 Print Preview
https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=19_Zoning 111/193
j. Facade and lengths must be varied.
Structures greater than sixty feet (60') but less than one hundred twenty feet (120') in length must
exhibit a prominent shift in the façade(s) predominantly visible from a public street so that no
greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the length of the building façade appears unbroken.
Each shift shall be in the form of either a ten foot (10') change in building facade alignment or a
ten foot (10') change in roofline height, or a combined change in facade and roofline totaling ten
feet (10'). Structures which exceed one hundred twenty feet (120') in length on any facade shall
provide a prominent shift in the mass of the structure at each one hundred twenty foot (120')
interval (or less if the developer desires) reflecting a change in the function or scale. The shift shall
be the form of either a fifteen foot (15') change in the building facade alignment or fifteen foot (15')
change in roofline. A combination of both the roofline and facade change is encouraged. To that
end, if the combined change occurs at the same location of the building plane a fifteen foot (15')
total change will be considered as full compliance.
k. A clearly defined entry with consideration to the following items will be required:
i. Peaked roof forms.
ii. Arches.
iii. Canopies or porticos.
iv. Raised corniced parapets.
v. Outdoor patios.
vi. Wing walls with integral planters.
vii. Overhangs.
viii. Architectural details which are integrated into the building structure and design.
l. On commercial/industrial buildings where the Zoning Administrator determines that an
unreasonable hardship is created by compliance with Subsection 19.13.060(j), any two (2) of the
following items may be required on at least sixty percent (60%) of the façade(s) predominantly
visible from a public street(s): (An unreasonable hardship is considered to be financial, structural,
or topographical.)
i. Arcades.
ii. Awnings.
iii. Raised or ground level integral planters.
iv. Windows.
v. Reveals projecting ribs, false columns, etc.
In allowing this option, the Zoning Administrator must find that the design will meet the intent of the requirements
in Subsection 19.13.060(j). (See Diagram A-12.) For the purposes of this Section, unreasonable hardship may
be considered to be significant financial increases, or structural, or topographic difficulties.

19.16.050 Landscape Buffer And Fencing Modifications And Waivers
Where the provisions of this Chapter would reduce the usable area of a lot due to lot configuration or size to a
point which would preclude a reasonable use of the lot, landscape buffer and fencing may be waived or modified
by the Land Use Authority as defined in Section 19.01.135 where the intent of this Chapter has been met through
the combination of structural and landscape design techniques.
1. An application shall be made by the property owner or certified agent thereof to the Community and
Economic Development Department. The application shall be accompanied by maps, drawings, or other
documents sufficient to demonstrate that the general and specific requirements of this Title will be met.
The application for any landscape buffer/fencing modification or waiver shall be accompanied by the
appropriate fee as authorized in the City’s currently adopted Consolidated Fee Schedule.
2. At least seven (7) days prior to the Land Use Authority meeting during which the landscape buffer/fencing
modification or waiver will be considered a Notice Sign shall be posted a minimum of one (1) sign on
each street frontage of the subject property stating the proposed request for landscape buffer/fencing
modification or waiver, and the date, time and location of the Land Use Authority meeting in which the
landscape buffer/fencing modification or waiver will be considered. The applicant shall be notified of the
date, time and location of the public meeting and of any final action on a pending application.
3. In considering an application for a landscape buffer/fencing modification or waiver, the Land Use
Authority shall give due regard to the nature and condition of adjacent uses and structures.
4. The landscape buffer may be modified where the building, fencing, and/or the land between that building
and the property line has been specifically designed to minimize adverse impact through a combination of
structural and landscape design techniques.
5. The landscape buffer and fencing requirements may be waived or modified where the adjacent land is
designated on the zoning map or in the adopted Master Plan for a use similar to that of the parcel under
site plan consideration. In situations where a petitioner is requesting that required fencing be waived or
modified on residential developments adjacent to agricultural uses and/or zoning districts the following
criteria must apply:
a. The adjacent agricultural property must have all the infrastructure (roads, sewer, water, storm
sewer, etc.) necessary for development; or
b. The topography or vegetation of the adjacent property would make a fence ineffective or cause a
hardship if the developer is required to fence the property.
6. The landscape buffer and fencing requirements may be modified where the adjoining property is used for
any public purpose other than a school or hospital.
7. The landscape buffer and fencing requirements may be modified where adjacent residential property is
used for any conditional use except nursery schools, day care centers, and schools of general and
special education.
8. The landscape buffer and fencing requirements may be modified when a residential subdivision borders a
railroad or transit right-of-way, freeway, or arterial street. The subdivision design shall include adequate
provisions for noise reduction, safety, and visual screening. The modification of the landscape buffer
may, in some cases, provide for a larger buffer area and additional plantings depending on the type and
location of the use which is being buffered. Parallel streets, fences, landscaped buffer areas, berms, and
sound walls; or combination of buffer techniques may be required.
9. The fencing requirement may be waived or modified where the topography of the lot providing the fencing
and the lot being protected is such that a fence would not be effective.
10. The landscape buffer and fencing requirement may be modified for any public use when such has been
specifically designed to minimize adverse impact on adjacent properties.

19.16.075 Permitted Trees Within Park Strips And Along Frontages
1. The planting of any tree within a park strip shall be done in compliance with the following:
a. The tree shall be planted so it is centered between the curb and sidewalk;
b. The tree shall be located so as not to violate the clear view requirements of this Title;
c. The tree to be planted shall be a tree listed in Table 16-4 and designated based on the width of
the park strip;
d. The tree shall be maintained to ensure proper clearance above the sidewalk and street, distance
from overhead powerlines, and so that its growth does not damage public improvements, such as
curb, gutter, and sidewalk; and
e. Before planting of trees the adjacent property owner shall contact blue stakes or a utility locating
company to locate underground utilities within the park strip.
2. The planting of any tree outside of a park strip along a lot's frontage shall be a minimum of six feet (6')
from the sidewalk for any tree listed in Table 16-4. Any other tree not listed therein shall be planted a
minimum of ten feet (10') from the sidewalk.
3. The planting or maintaining of a tree in accordance with this Section does not alleviate the property owner
of the liability or responsibility of any damage caused to public improvements or any other responsibility of
owning or having control over the property on which the tree is located. Property owners are responsible
for the damage caused to public improvements by vegetation on their property or planted by them. The
maintenance and correction process is addressed in Chapter 12.28 of the Layton Municipal Code.
4. If a person wishes the City to consider the addition of a tree to Table 16-4, such request is to be in writing
to the Director of the Community and Economic Development Department. The writing must contain
sufficient detail and information regarding the tree and illustrate its comparable nature to the trees
currently on the list. The Director or designee will notify the person of the decision. If the request is
denied, the person can file an appeal of that decision to the City Manager within ten (10) days of the
denial. The City Manager will review the Department's decision to determine whether that decision is
supported by substantial evidence. Based on that standard, the City Manager may affirm, modify, or
reverse the Department's decision. The City Manager's decision is final.

19.16.080 Screening/Fence Requirements, Permit, And Clear View
1. The following provisions shall govern the height and location of fences, walls, plant growth, or other
obstructions to view:
a. In all residential zones, no fence, hedge, or wall may exceed six feet (6') in height when placed
within three feet (3') of any property line or as further regulated below except behind the front
setback line of the main structure fences may be eight feet (8') in height. Special permits may be
granted for higher fences by the Zoning Administrator.
b. When a fence, wall, or hedge meets the setback regulations for an accessory structure for the
zoning district in which the fence, wall, or hedge is proposed, the height allowed will be that as
outlined for accessory structures in the zoning district.

https://layton.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinances&name=19_Zoning 143/193
c. Clear view for driveways required. No view obstructing fence, wall, hedge, or planting
exceeding two feet (2') in height above the level of the sidewalk, shall be located in the triangular
area bounded by lines drawn from a point on the centerline of the driveway setback fifteen feet
(15') from the front property line, to points at the property line in front of the property, thirty feet
(30') either side of the centerline of the driveway for local and local collectors, and fifty feet (50') on
collectors and arterials. Except that shade trees may be located or maintained in such area in
excess of the height provided the same are pruned clear of all branches between the ground and
a height of six feet (6'). Nonview obstructing fences not exceeding six feet (6') in height may also
be allowed in this area.
d. Shade trees or other plantings which project over any sidewalk shall be pruned clear of all
branches between the ground and a height of seven feet (7') for that portion of the plant located
over the sidewalk. Shade trees and plantings which project over any street or access road which
may be used for emergency purposes, shall be trimmed to a height of thirteen feet six inches
(13'6") from the grade of the street or access road.
e. Where lots have double frontages, that area designated by the property owner as the rear yard
may have a solid or view obstructing fence, wall, or hedge, not exceeding eight feet (8') in height.
Such fence, wall, or hedge, shall be no closer than at the sidewalk.
f. A nonview obstructing fence not exceeding six feet (6') in height may be erected in any front yard
space, including those areas that are normally reserved for a clear view.
g. No fence, whether of wood, metal, masonry, or concrete, nor other obstruction including
shrubbery, nor any combination of materials, shall be erected or maintained which blocks the
access from a front yard through both sides to the rear yard.
h. Construction of fences and retaining walls must meet applicable requirements of Title 15 of this
Code. For construction of all fences over six feet (6') and retaining walls, a building permit must be
secured.
2. Clear view across corner property required. No obstruction to view will be permitted on that portion of
a corner lot defined as the clear view area. Where curbs are installed, the clear view area shall include

yard on vacant lots, the maximum height of fences or other similar structures shall be six feet (6').
4. Grading, planting, or construction. Any grading, planting, or construction that interferes with the vision
of those using the streets, sidewalks, alleys, or driveways is prohibited.
5. Retaining walls. Where a retaining wall protects a cut below or a fill above the natural grade and is
located on the line separating lots, such retaining wall may be topped by a fence, wall, or hedge of the
same height that would otherwise be permitted at the location if no retaining wall existed.

19.17.010 through 19.17.040, as part of any petition to amend the zoning map for a CP or C-H designation.
1. Required property ownership. A CP or C-H zone may only be established upon land held in single
ownership or under unified control or where the City Council, upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission, determines that development on separate adjoining properties shall be coordinated to form
a physically unified commercial facility which will be more appropriate and compatible with the
surrounding land uses.
2. Nonconforming uses prohibited. A CP or C-H zone shall not be established upon a tract of land which
would contain a nonconforming use after the passage of an amendment to the zoning ordinance unless
the development planned for the tract includes the elimination of the nonconforming use.

conceptual development plan for the commercial site showing a unified and organized arrangement of
buildings of the proposed uses, off-street parking, internal traffic circulation, and landscaping. The plan

for the evaluation of the application or part thereof in terms of the following:
a. The need or desirability to change the zoning ordinance in the public interest;
b. Master plan consideration;
c. The amount of land included in the rezoning application which can be realistically supported in
commercial use; and
d. The finding that the proposed development will promote the general welfare of the public. For the
purposes of this Subsection, a market analysis shall contain the following elements:
i. The trade area of the proposed shopping center;
ii. Trade area population, both present and potential;
iii. Effective buying power in the trade area;
iv. Net potential customer buying power for stores in the proposed shopping center; and
v. The residue of buying power to be expended in existing shopping centers of commercial
areas serving the trade area.
5. Consideration of developer's ability. The developer's ability to undertake the proposed project will be
considered by the Planning Commission and City Council as part of the request for rezoning.
6. Planning Commission's recommendation duties. The Planning Commission shall recommend
approval or denial of the zoning petition and preliminary development plans to the Council. The
recommendation of the Planning Commission may contain conditions, limitations, or amendments to the
preliminary development plan to insure that the planned commercial development is integrated into its
surroundings and serves the public interest to the greatest extent possible.
7. Council decision on petition to rezone. The City Council, after holding a public hearing thereon and
after a recommendation by the Planning Commission, may approve or disapprove the petition for
rezoning. In approving a rezoning petition, the Council shall concurrently approve a preliminary
development plan, the amount required to insure completion of the landscaping, together with whatever
amendments, conditions, or requirements as it may deem necessary to secure the purpose of this
Chapter.
8. Conditions of rezoning approval. The Planning Commission may recommend at the time of rezoning
approval, conditions of approval of the final site development including the sequence of development, and
may require that initial building permits must include the major facilities of a proposal.

CP or C-H zone, a final development plan for the entire zoning district or for the initial phase of a phased
development plan has been approved, shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission
as complying with the regulations and requirements attached thereto prior to the issuance of any building
or land use permits. The final development plan shall show in detail the proposed areas and locations of
buildings, off-street parking, internal and external traffic circulation, improvements, landscaping, signs,
and service facilities. No changes shall be made in the final development plan during the course of
construction pursuant thereto without first obtaining prior approval of the Planning Commission. Copies of
the approved final development plan shall be kept on file in the office of the Planning Commission,
Building Inspector, and City Recorder, and only changes which may be subsequently approved shall be
added thereto.

10. Property deed restrictions stating property development in accordance with approved final site
development plan. At the time a CP or C-H zone is established and before building permits are issued,
a document on the property covered under the proposed new zone change shall be filed by the owners of
the property after approval by the City Attorney with the County Recorder and shall provide that
development take place on the property only in accordance with a final site development plan approved
by the Land Use Authority and on file with the County Recorder.
11. Building permit required. Building permit required. Time limits for construction commencement. A
building permit shall be secured in accordance with the approved final site development plan within
eighteen (18) months from the effective date of the ordinance resulting in the rezoning of the parcel.

commencement. Said applications for extensions may be made no more than two (2) times. Applications
for extensions shall require a showing to the Land Use Authority’s satisfaction of unique conditions or
situation, and of imminent success in tenant leasing and construction commencement. All such
applications shall include detailed documentation as to the circumstances and reasons for such request
as required by the Land Use Authority.
12. Delay of construction commencement shall result in review of zoning classification. The Land Use
Authority shall review the classification of the zoning district and the progress of the development which
has taken place and in the event construction is not started within the specified time limits or once
construction has started, it ceases and no further significant construction toward completion to an
appreciable degree is done for one hundred eighty (180) days, the Land Use Authority shall examine the
project and cause for such delays. If deemed necessary, the Land Use Authority shall institute
proceedings to restore the zone to its prior classification or to a zone consistent with the comprehensive
land-use plan.
The Land Use Authority shall determine what an "appreciable degree" is by considering the following
factors:
a. Change in financial ability of developer or owner to complete a project.
b. The amount of the project completed and yet to complete.
c. The amount of work done within a three (3) month period in both the type or work and the cost of
work done.
13. Construction completion time limit. Construction completion time limit. A plan for staged development
which will require more time than the limits contained in Subsection 19.17.050(11) of the Layton Municipal
Code, may be approved by the Land Use Authority at the time the rezoning is recommended or may be
approved by the Land Use Authority prior to or during the course of construction of the commercial
center.
14. Failure to complete in established time will result in review of the zoning classification. In the
event the construction is not completed within the time limit specified in Section 19.14.060 of the Layton
Municipal Code, the Land Use Authority shall review the zoning and development which has taken place,
and if necessary, initiate proceedings to reclassify the property or thereof in a manner consistent with the
master land-use plan.

19.18.040 Appeals, Process, Notice Of Appeal
1. Appeals Process, Notice of Appeal. The applicant, a board or officer of the City, or any person
adversely affected by a decision administering or interpreting a land use ordinance may, within ten days
of the date of the final decision, appeal that decision to the Appeal Authority by alleging that there is error
in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Land Use Authority in the
administration or interpretation of the land use ordinance. The appeal shall be filed, in writing, with the
office of the City Recorder, and shall state with specificity the reasons for the appeal.
a. An appellant or adversely affected party must first present to the Land Use Authority any and all
information pertinent to its land use application or request. On appeal, the appellant may not bring
new information for consideration by the Hearing Officer that has not first been presented to the
Land Use Authority during its consideration of the matter.
b. An appellant or adversely affected party shall present to the Hearing Officer every theory for relief
that it can raise in district court.
c. An appellant or adversely affected party bears the burden to prove, by substantial evidence, that
there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination in the administration or
interpretation of the land use ordinance.

d. The Hearing Officer shall presume that the decision that is being appealed is correct, and shall
only modify the decision if there is substantial evidence presented to the Hearing Officer that the
Zoning Administrator, the Community and Economic Development Director or Planning
Commission erred in its application or interpretation of the land use ordinances.
i. When presented with legal issues, the Hearing Officer shall apply a correctness standard
to its review. Inasmuch as no specialized knowledge is necessary to make such a
determination, no deference is given to the Land Use Authority.
ii. When presented with factual issues, the Hearing Officer shall apply an arbitrary and
capricious standard to its review, and the decision of a Land Use Authority shall not be
disturbed if there is substantial evidence in the record that discloses a reasonable basis for
its decision. Inasmuch as land use authorities and administrative officials have specialized
knowledge in the field of planning and land use and are expected to implement the goals
and policies of the City, they should be allowed a comparatively wide latitude of discretion.
Their decisions should be disturbed only if the Hearing Officer determines that the
decision is arbitrary, capricious or illegal.
e. An appeal stays all proceedings in the action that is the subject of the appeal. In the event a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property, the party seeking protection from imminent peril
may seek an expedited ruling from the Hearing Officer or may seek immediate relief from the
district court.
f. Proceedings and hearings before the Hearing Officer shall be in conformance with the general
principles of due process.
g. The person or entity filing the appeal may appear at such hearing in person, by agent, or by an
attorney of his/her choice and may present to the Hearing Officer any evidence or argument to
support the contentions on appeals.
h. The Land Use Authority that rendered the decision that is being appealed shall appear and
present any evidence or argument it finds necessary to justify its decision.
i. The Hearing Officer shall cause a record of its proceedings to be kept, including a recording of all
evidentiary proceedings and all oral arguments of the parties, and shall make written findings and
conclusions of all of its decisions.
2. Review of the Land Use Authority’s Record. The Hearing Officer’s review of any decision of a Land
Use Authority shall be confined to the administrative record developed by the Land Use Authority, unless
the Hearing Officer determines that the record is incomplete or deficient. If the Hearing Officer determines
that the record is incomplete or deficient, the Hearing Officer may review the matter de novo.

2. The Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized to decide certain matters, as designated by the Land Use
Hearing Officer, that are consistent with the guidelines established by this Title and state law and the
rules adopted by the Land Use Hearing Officer. Pursuant to that authority the Zoning Administrator may
decide all cases which are routine in nature, uncontested, that do not impact the character of the
neighborhood, are primarily brought about by recent changes in the zoning ordinance, or City initiated
development or construction that has resulted in the creation of noncomplying structures. The specific
types of decisions the Zoning Administrator is authorized to make shall include:
a. The determination of a nonconforming use which can be verified by substantial evidence.
Substantial evidence, for the purpose of this Section shall mean official documents, including any
written correspondence, receipts, permits, or documents issued by a public body or agency
thereof, etc., that may establish the truth of the matter asserted by the applicant;
b. Consider additions or alterations to existing buildings and structures, which are noncomplying as
to height, area, or yard regulations, providing that the addition follows the existing wall lines and
no additional dwelling units are added to the building or structure;
c. Change in the status of a nonconforming use to a less intense use than that immediately
preceding the proposed use;
d. Final review and approval on plans where the Land Use Hearing Officer has required that a final
plan be submitted for special approval, showing that all requirements imposed by the Land Use
Hearing Officer in granting the original approval have been complied with; and
e. The granting of a variance in the very limited instance wherein the applicant and the City are in
complete agreement regarding all issues, and that the spirit and intent of the Layton City zoning
ordinance is satisfied and that all criteria required statutorily for variance have also been satisfied.
3. The notice requirements established by the ordinance, that are required before a hearing on a variance,
must still be satisfied by the Zoning Administrator. However, in lieu of giving notice of a time, date, and
place of a hearing, the Zoning Administrator's notice shall provide for a time frame within which all
interested parties may submit their input to the Zoning Administrator. All responses received pursuant to
the notice shall become a permanent part of the file.
4. A decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Land Use Hearing Officer as provided for
in this Chapter.

applied to a parcel of property that such person owns, leases or in which such person holds some other
beneficial interest may apply to the Hearing Officer for a variance from the terms of this Title.
a. The appeal authority may grant a variance only if:
i. literal enforcement of the ordinance would cause an unreasonable hardship for the
applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general purpose of the land use ordinances;
ii. there are special circumstances attached to the property that do not generally apply to
other properties in the same zone;
iii. granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial property right
possessed by other property in the same zone;
iv. the variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will not be contrary to the
public interest; and
v. the spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial justice done.
b. In determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause unreasonable
hardship under Subsection (1)(a), the appeal authority may not find an unreasonable hardship
unless the alleged hardship:
i. is located on or associated with the property for which the variance is sought; and
ii. comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from conditions that are general to
the neighborhood.
(1) In determining whether or not enforcement of the land use ordinance would cause
unreasonable hardship under Subsection (1)(a), the appeal authority may not find
an unreasonable hardship if the hardship is self-imposed or economic.
c. In determining whether or not there are special circumstances attached to the property under
Subsection (1)(a), the appeal authority may find that special circumstances exist only if the special
circumstances:
i. relate to the hardship complained of; and
ii. deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in the same zone.
d. The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all conditions justifying a variance have been
met.
e. Variances run with the land.
f. The appeal authority may not grant a use variance.
g. In granting a variance, the appeal authority may impose additional requirements on the applicant
that will:

take effect on the date when it issues a written decision, or at a different time as may be designated in the
written decision. A written decision of the Hearing Officer constitutes a final decision under U.C.A §10-9a-
801(2)(a) and §10-9a-801(4). A person adversely affected by a final decision of the Hearing Officer shall
file a petition for review with the District Court within thirty (30) days after the date of the decision.
2. Ex Parte Communications – Penalty. It shall be unlawful for any individual, including the party bringing the
appeal or requesting a variance, to discuss substantive matters pertaining to a pending appeal or variance with the
Hearing Officer. Violation of this section shall be a Class C Misdemeanor. The requirements of the section shall
not apply to proceedings and communications during a properly scheduled public meeting or hearing for
consideration of the appeal or variance, communications where all parties are present and given an opportunity to
speak, or to a discussion limited to procedural matters not related to the substance of the proceedings, such as the
date, time or place of the hearing.
3. Governmental Immunity. The Hearing Officer shall be considered an appointed official and shall be
entitled to all of the protections of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act.
4. Compensation – Contract. Terms for compensation and reimbursement shall be memorialized by
written contract with the Administrative Hearing Officer. The written contract required by this section shall

a. No person may file a petition for review of the Hearing Officer’s decision unless he/she has first
exhausted his/her administrative remedies.
b. The petition to the district court may allege only that the Hearing Officer’s decision was arbitrary,
capricious, or illegal.
c. The petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the Hearing Officer’s decision. However, the
time for filing an appeal to the district court is stayed by the filing of a request for arbitration of a
constitutional taking issue with the Utah Property Rights Ombudsman under U.C.A. §13-43-204; in
which event, a petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after completion of proceedings before
the Ombudsman.

transcript of all proceedings, all documentary evidence received at the hearing, and a copy of the
Hearing Officer’s rulings, findings, and orders. The transcript shall be made by a person
authorized to make certified transcripts of recorded proceedings, and shall bear a certification that
the transcript is a true and correct copy of the proceedings before the Hearing Officer.
i. If a transcript is made of the proceedings before the Hearing Officer, the district court’s
review is limited to the record. The district court shall affirm the decision of the Hearing
Officer if the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record and is not
arbitrary, capricious, or illegal.
ii. If there is no record of the proceedings before the Hearing Officer, the appeal to the district
court shall be a de novo appeal.
e. The district court may hear only those issues and theories for relief that are raised in the
proceedings before the Hearing Officer.
f. The filing of a petition with the district court does not stay the decision of the Hearing Officer
unless the Hearing Officer determines, in writing, that a stay is in the best interests of the City or
that enforcement of the ruling would cause imminent peril to life or property. This section shall not
preclude a party from seeking a stay from the district court.
g. The court shall affirm the decision of the Hearing Officer if the decision is supported by substantial
evidence in the record and is not arbitrary, capricious, or illegal.
6. The Community and Economic Development Director may develop a graphical matrix to show the powers
and duties of each Land Use Authority within the City, the appeal authority for decisions of the Land Use
Authority, and the time for appeal of any decision.

The following table identifies uses which have varying potentials to contaminate groundwater sources. These
uses have been classified according to the risk of contamination in each protection zone as follows:
Permitted Uses (P) – The risk of contamination is considered relatively low in the specified zone if regulatory
requirements and Best Management Practices (BMP) are implemented and, therefore, the use is permitted.
Conditional Uses (C) – The risk of contamination is considered relatively low in the specified zone. The use
may be permitted only after conditional use review and approval by the Land Use Authority as defined in Section
19.01.135. Approval is subject to implementation of Best Management Practices (BMP) and compliance with
other reasonable conditions as may be established by the Land Use Authority. The Utah Division of Drinking
Water Quality shall review all conditional use requests.
Prohibited Uses (X) – The risk of contamination is very high in the specified zone. The use is not permitted.

1. Prior to final approval of any subdivision or other development activity requiring water service or an
increase in water service, from the City, the developer shall dedicate to the City, a sufficient quantity of
water necessary to provide and deliver water to each lot and/or dwelling unit, or use, within the new
development. A sufficient quantity of water shall be defined as follows:
a. A sufficient number of water system shares or supply, to provide a minimum of three (3) acre feet
of water per acre of land proposed for development. The City Engineer may adjust this amount
depending on the type of use and the water requirements for the use.

shares, that were not within the control of the applicant or any predecessor in interest.
c. That development cannot occur upon the property without the shares.
d. The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions justifying the granting of
this exception have been met.

19.24.010 Condominium/Townhouse (C-TH) Zoning District
Purpose. The condominium/townhouse (C-TH) zoning district allows for townhouses, row houses,
courtyard/garden court residential, "Big House" condos, live-work units, patio homes, alley-fed townhomes and
cottages, senior housing, or other commonwall residential buildings for more than two (2) families to be used
near City transportation corridors and nodes. The intent of this zoning district is to create residential projects and
neighborhoods that provide a variety of housing opportunities and choices that include a range of housing types.
Condominium and townhouse projects shall provide convenient access to commercial uses and employment
opportunities that are located in areas with existing, or probable future, multiple transportation choices. These
types of housing offer several advantages over single-family detached houses: lower costs for land development,
conservation of the land by using less land for a given number of houses and preserving open space, lower longterm
maintenance costs, energy efficiency, and increased security for both the house and the neighborhood.

2. "Courtyard/garden court residential": A group of detached or attached residential dwelling units (smalllot
homes or townhomes) surrounding a common green or plaza area.
3. "Live-work unit": Townhouse dwelling unit where office space is allowed to be secondary to the primary
residential use and a limited number of outside employees and customers may be allowed.
4. "Patio homes": Detached, single-family units typically situated on a reduced-size lot that orients outdoor
activity within rear or side yard patio areas for better use of the site for outdoor living space.
5. "Townhouse": A one-family dwelling unit, with a private entrance, which is part of a structure whose

19.26.010 Purpose And Intent
The purpose of the mixed-use/transit oriented development (MU-TOD) zoning district is to provide locations for
developments near transit centers that allow concentrations of commercial, retail, and multiple-family residential
uses that can take advantage of public transportation facilities. By allowing a mix of uses, non-residential
development can create jobs, shopping, and entertainment opportunities for residents while residential
development can generate twenty-four (24) hour vitality in support of the non-residential uses. This zoning district
also uses the demand for higher density development generated by mixed-use design to help accomplish
Layton's land preservation goals through the voluntary use of transfer of development rights.

1. The R-2 and R-M1 zones require eight thousand (8,000) square feet for the first two dwelling units.
The R-M2 and R-H zones require ten thousand (10,000) square feet for the first two (2) dwelling units.
2. Corner lots shall meet the minimum lot width requirement on both street frontages.
3. In a subdivision of eight (8) lots or more, the lots shall be designed to provide for a variety of lot
widths. Twenty-five percent (25%) of the lots in the subdivision shall have a lot width of at least five feet
(5') wider at the required front setback, then the required minimum of the zone. Twenty-five percent
(25%) of the lots in the subdivision shall have a lot width of at least ten feet (10') wider at the required
front setback, than the required minimum of the zone. In order to distribute the varied lot widths
throughout the subdivision, no more than five (5) lots in a row of the minimum lot width of the zone shall

5. Residential building lots should not face onto arterial streets. In those limited circumstances where
the only available frontage is on an arterial street, it is important to achieve the greatest setback possible
to protect residents from the noise and safety hazards associated with potentially high volumes of traffic
and high speeds. Side yard setbacks should also include greater setbacks for those same reasons.
Arterial streets are defined in 19.02 Layton Municipal Code.
6. In the R-1 and R-2 zones, the landscape buffer requirements of 19.16.090 apply.
7. Minimum side yard setback for an accessory structure on an interior lot is three feet (3') if the
accessory structure is located at least six feet (6') behind the principal structure - otherwise, side yard
setback for principal structures would apply to the accessory structure.
8. Corner lots may have an accessory structure located within five feet (5') of the corner side yard
property line nearest the street when: It is not more than twelve feet (12') in height to mid-point; the yard
is walled or fenced to a minimum height of six feet (6'). The wall or fence is sight-obscuring; and
extended three feet (3') in length beyond the accessory structure and runs parallel to the adjacent
street(s). The accessory structure is not adjacent to the front yard of the adjoining property; the
accessory structure is placed behind the rear foundation line of the principle structure; and is in
compliance with clear view requirements. Accessory structures with a garage door facing and running
parallel with the adjacent street must comply with the corner side yard setbacks of the specific zone.
9. Accessory strutures over eighteen feet (18') in heigh shall have an additional three feet (3') setback
from all property lines and the rear of the main structure for every additional one foot (1') in height.

20.01.010 Purpose And Intent
The purpose of the sign regulations set forth in this Title shall be to eliminate potential hazards to

which to live and work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade; to effectively
index the environment; to safeguard and enhance property values; to protect public and private
investment in buildings and open spaces; to eventually eliminate nonconforming signs (see definition
under "Sign, nonconforming"); to supplement and be a part of the regulations imposed and the plan set
forth under the zoning ordinance of the City of Layton; to implement those portions of the City's General
Plan relating to signage; and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
It is also the intent of this Title to govern the number, size, type, location, and other provisions relating to
signs within the various zones of the City as the zones are established and designated by the zoning
ordinance of the City of Layton. No signs shall be allowed in these zones unless exempt under this Title
or expressly permitted by the zoning ordinance, or unless said signs comply with the regulations

Any owner or occupant of property experiencing a hardship, as defined herein, as a result of the
regulations of this Title, may seek relief therefrom pursuant to this Section.

lot configuration, that so restricts the placement of a sign on the property under this Title, that the
property cannot host a sign in a similar manner to other properties within the same zoning
district. A hardship is not a condition that is or was created by the owner or occupant, nor is a
hardship an economic loss or lost economic opportunity.

generally apply to other properties in the same district;
iii. Granting the relief is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial property right
possessed by other property in the same district;

contrary to the public interest; and
v. The spirit of this Title is observed and substantial justice done.
c. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Community and Economic
Development Director may appeal that decision to the City Council. Any such appeal
must be in writing and be submitted to the Office of the City Manager within ten (10) days
