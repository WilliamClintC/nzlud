TOWN OF BRISTOL
ZONING REGULATIONS
INTRODUCTION TO THESE ZONING REGULATIONS
The Bristol Town Plan provides the vision for how Bristol should grow and develop. All Regulations governing land use in the Town of Bristol stem from the Bristol Town Plan and should serve to implement the visions contained in it. The Regulations should work in concert to provide a clear, fair and efficient administrative process to guide and control development.
These Zoning Regulations (these “Regulations”) constitute the primary regulatory tool by which the Town of Bristol implements the vision in its Town Plan. They include the Flood Hazard Area Regulations and the Downtown Design Review criteria for the area encompassing Bristol’s Downtown Designation. Bristol does not have subdivision Regulations. For any given application, only a portion of these Regulations will apply. These Regulations are intended to be comprehensive and are organized to clarify the review process before the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission or Zoning Board of Adjustment.
HOW TO USE THESE REGULATIONS
This introduction is intended to help the applicant and the public understand how these Regulations function and to help an applicant and other parties interested in the application understand the development permit process in Bristol.
Article I of this document contains the general administrative framework for the Regulations. It is designed to provide general information regarding the purpose of the Regulations and how the Regulations function. It provides overall context, but is less important to individual applications than other Sections.
Article II, which establishes the zoning districts, constitutes the functional heart of the document. It is generally the best place for anyone considering an application to start reviewing the Regulations. Article II and the zoning map establish a zoning district for each portion of town, the uses that will be allowed in each district and specific setback and other Regulations governing where uses may take place on a specific parcel. Applicants should use the zoning map and text in Article II to determine in which zoning district their parcel lies. Once they have identified the district, they should review the Regulations to identify the types of uses or development allowed in the district, to determine whether their desired use or development is allowed in the district, and if so, what procedure they will need to follow to apply. Next they should determine the specific dimensional setbacks that govern where the use or development sits on the property. Lastly, they should look for references to other portions of these Regulations that apply to their proposed use.
Article III governs the permitting process an applicant will need to go through to develop or use their property in the manner proposed in their application. Article III starts by listing exempt uses or development not subject to these Regulations and therefore not requiring a permit. If the use or development an applicant plans is not exempt, it will require a permit. The applicant will need
8
to read Article III, or speak with the Zoning Administrator to determine the process they need to follow to apply for a permit. These Regulations have two general review processes:
An administrative review process for uses listed as “Permitted Uses” within the district are specifically given to the Zoning Administrator to review; or
A more complicated review process for commercial uses or larger development proposals conducted by the Planning Commission or ZBA, bodies that act in deciding whether a permit application satisfies these Regulations.
In all cases, once an applicant has developed an idea of what they would like to do, where in Bristol they desire to do it and whether or not it is exempt from zoning, the best place for an applicant to start is with the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator serves as the front door for all zoning, subdivision or flood hazard area development or uses in the Town of Bristol. In addition to reviewing specific applications, the Zoning Administrator must also help applicants to understand and develop a proper application to request the type of use or development they are proposing and direct the applicant to the proper review process. Lastly, Article III also establishes the hearing requirements for all applications going before the Planning Commission or ZBA. Although applicants may apply for different development or uses, these Regulations are intended to ensure that each applicant, and all people interested in the application, receive consistent and fair treatment.
Article IV, Article V, Article VI and Article VII constitute required, general, specific and performance related zoning Regulations that govern types of uses and development or specified uses. Each may or may not apply to any given application. Applicants are encouraged to review them thoroughly or speak about them specifically with the Zoning Administrator.
Article VIII governs the application and review criteria for building within the Flood Hazard Zone within Bristol. Article IX provides definitions contained within these Regulations.
In drafting these Regulations, the Planning Commission sought to provide a consistent, fair and unified process to regulate land development. Over previous rounds of zoning Bristol has changed standards causing a small number of properties to have their historical uses classified as “pre-existing” and “non-conforming” in the zones in which they are located. If owners of such “grandfathered” properties should subsequently request changes or expansions compatible with their original uses and scale, these Regulations encourage the appropriate municipal panel to work with the landowner to reach flexible solutions that meet the needs of the owners and protect the overall character of the zone. The Planning Commission sought to balance its respect for an individual’s property rights with Regulations intended to implement the community’s desire for proper growth and development as envisioned in the Town Plan.
Thank you.
The Bristol Planning Commission

ARTICLE I: ENACTMENT, INTENT AND ORGANIZATION
SECTION 100: ENACTMENT
In accordance with the Vermont Municipal and Regional Planning and Development Act, 24 V.S.A., Chapter 117, hereinafter referred to as the “Act”, there are hereby established Zoning Regulations for the Town of Bristol (the “Town”) which are set forth in the text and map that constitute these Regulations. These Regulations shall be known and cited as the “Town of Bristol Zoning Regulations” and referred to herein as “these Regulations”.
SECTION 110: INTENT
It is the intent of these Regulations to provide for orderly community growth and to further the purposes established in SECTION 4302 of The Act, and to implement the vision and objectives of the Bristol Town Plan.
SECTION 120: APPLICABILITY
All land development or development in the Town of Bristol must comply with these
Regulations. As used herein, the term "land development" or “development” includes: the division of a parcel into two or more parcels or the use of existing parcels in a way which increases the number of housing units on such parcels; the construction, reconstruction, conversion, exterior structural alteration that does increase the footprint, relocation, or enlargement of any building or other structure; any mining, excavation or landfill; any change in the use of any building or other structure, or land or extension of use of land; any increase in the number of driveway intersection, either in number or in units served, when said intersection adjoins or enters into a town or state highway.
Any land development or development not in accordance with these Regulations shall be deemed prohibited.
SECTION 130: EFFECTIVE DATE
These Regulations or amendments thereto shall take effect when adopted by the Town of Bristol in accordance with the voting and other procedures contained in SECTION 4442 of the Act.
SECTION 140: REPEAL OF FORMER ZONING BYLAWS AND REGULATIONS
The Zoning Bylaws and Regulations, including the Zoning Map for the Town of Bristol in effect prior to the adoption of these Regulations, including the Map are hereby repealed as of the effective date of these Regulations and are replaced by these Regulations.
SECTION 150: INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations shall be held to be reasonable requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare. Except where these Regulations specifically provided to the contrary, these Regulations are not intended to repeal, annul or in any way to impair any Regulations or permits previously adopted or issued. However, where these Regulations impose a greater restriction upon the use of a structure or land than are required by any other statutes, ordinances, rule, regulation, permit, easement, or agreement, the provisions of these Regulations shall control.
10
SECTION 160: SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Regulations or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of these Regulations which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and for this purpose the provisions of these Regulations are severable.
SECTION 170: AMENDMENTS
These Regulations may be amended according to the requirements and procedures established in 24 V.S.A. §§ 4441 and 4442.

SECTION 210: ZONING MAP
The location and boundaries of zoning districts are established as shown on the Zoning Map recorded in the Bristol Town Clerk’s office. A non-official reproduction, including a second map enlarging the area in and around the village is included herein for convenience only. The Zoning Map constitutes a part of these Regulations and of all future amendments to these Regulations.
SECTION 220: INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
If uncertainty exists with respect to the boundary of any zoning district on the Zoning Map, the Planning Commission shall determine the location of such boundary.
SECTION 230: ZONING DISTRICTS - GENERAL STANDARDS
This article describes the zoning districts within the Town of Bristol. Each district description contains three sub-sections. Sub-section A discusses objectives and guidelines intended for each district, specifically how each district relates back to the Bristol Town Plan (“the Plan”). Sub-section B describes the uses permitted in each district. Uses include “by right uses”, secured through a permit issued by the Town of Bristol Zoning Administrator, “by right uses” marked with an asterisk (*), which require Site Plan review by the appropriate municipal panel, or “conditional uses,” which are subject to more intensive review by the appropriate municipal panel. Sub-section C includes the regulations for acreage, setbacks and other physical design elements each district requires. The Zoning Map delineates boundaries for each zoning district.
In addition to the uses permitted in each district, certain uses are exempt from these Regulations, either by design of the Town of Bristol Planning Commission (the “Planning Commission”) or by state statute. Exempt uses are covered in SECTION 301 of these Regulations. For convenience, exempt uses are listed as a type of permitted use under subsection B describing uses in each zoning district.

A. Objectives and Guidelines
The purpose of this district is to promote the economic vitality of Bristol’s downtown business district, while maintaining its historic character, pedestrian scale and orientation, and small town atmosphere. This district is densely developed, largely with block commercial buildings, and is and planned to be Bristol’s primary retail center. Use of existing storefronts on Main Street for non-retail purposes shall be strongly discouraged. Full utilization of existing buildings is encouraged in a manner that preserves their architectural integrity, and demolition of structurally sound historic structures shall be strongly discouraged.

The purpose of this district is to maintain and enhance the historic look and character, quality of life and mixed-use environment extending outward from Bristol’s Village Business District. This area already contains a mixture of historic homes, but also remains suitable for office and commercial development because of its proximity to the existing commercial core of Bristol. Commercial development in this area should complement and reinforce Bristol’s village. It should retain the larger historic homes within the district. Accordingly, adaptive re-use of existing buildings is encouraged in a manner that preserves their architectural integrity, and demolition of structurally sound historic structures shall be strongly discouraged. The uses allowed should not greatly impact upon the area residences and therefore should have limited impacts stemming from traffic, noise, odor or safety hazards.

Conservation (CON)
A. Objectives and Guidelines
This district is primarily composed of large blocks of contiguous forest, a large portion of which is managed for timber production. These Regulations recognize the important ecological and economic functions of Bristol’s forestlands. This district includes lands poorly suited for development due to shallow soils, steep slopes, fragile or limited vegetation, inaccessibility and lack of infrastructure. The purpose of this district is to promote conservation and responsible management of the town’s natural resources, while providing opportunities for low-density rural living, resource-based businesses and enjoyment of nature. Development and land use within this district should be planned to limit disturbance to the natural environment and to promote sustainable uses.

Bristol Pond Camp (BPC)
A. Objectives and Guidelines
Bristol Pond constitutes a unique physical feature within the Town of Bristol. It supports low density outdoor recreational uses including: fishing, hunting, birding and canoeing or kayaking. It hosts several species of rare and endangered plants and some of the oldest known archeological sites in the State of Vermont. Most of the pond is surrounded by open, undeveloped land that largely constitutes floodplain and marsh on which development is prohibited. The only portion of land adjacent to the pond that has any development currently consists of the 15 pre-existing, non-conforming small camp lots commonly known as the “Lake Winona Landowners Association”. The primitive or seasonal camps or vacant lots that currently compose the district are small and many lack basic services like running water or functioning wastewater systems beyond an outhouse. The Bristol Pond Camp District constitutes a new district encompassing the 15 small lots that compose the Lake Winona Landowners Association and is surrounded by the Conservation District which encompasses the remainder of Bristol Pond. The Bristol Pond Camp District has two primary objectives. First, like the neighboring Conservation District, it is intended to protect the scenic, natural and historic qualities that make Bristol Pond unique. Second, it seeks to acknowledge the pre-existing primitive or seasonal camps and lots that exist on the Pond and to allow for very limited and appropriate improvements to those camps or lots.
In order to accomplish each of the objectives noted immediately above, the district offers the following guidelines controlling any new development in the district:
1. No further subdivision of any lot will be allowed within the district.
2. Only one single family dwelling unit will be allowed on each lot.
3. Year-round homes are prohibited in the district.
4. Primitive camps, with no interior plumbing consisting of more than a sink with water, will be allowed provided they are used for no more than 3 consecutive weeks per year, and no more than a total of 60 days per year. However, owners that can demonstrate that they use the camp more than the timeframe above and that the current level of use existed before January 1, 2007, will be allowed to continue using the camp at the level of use established prior to January 1, 2007. This date is significant as that use means that the camp is exempt from the permit requirements of the State Wastewater System and Potable Water Supply Rules under the “Clean State” exemption. The purpose of this guideline is to create a local permitting regime consistent with the state wastewater and potable water supply requirements and exemptions.
5. Seasonal camps, whether or not they have internal plumbing, that are used for 180 days per year or less will be allowed. Existing seasonal camps will be allowed to continue at the current level of use if the owner can demonstrate that the current level of use existed before January 1, 2007. This date is significant as that use means that the camp is exempt from the permit requirements of the State Wastewater System and Potable Water Supply Rules under the “Clean State” exemption. The purpose of this guideline is to create a local permitting regime consistent with the state wastewater and potable water supply requirements and exemptions.
6. Applicants applying for a zoning permit for any improvements or additions, like adding bedrooms, or making any other changes that would require a State Wastewater System and Potable Water Supply Permit, understand that that the Town of Bristol will condition the issuance of a final zoning permit upon the applicants’ securing a State permit.
7. No new structures may be erected within 100 feet of the shoreline of Bristol Pond as measured from the mean high water mark. However, pre-existing camps closer to the pond than 100 feet may add rooms or other improvements to the camp, but only if the proposed addition is no closer
28
to the pond and can meet the dimensional setback requirements for locating the addition on the side of the structure or on the portion of the structure furthest away from the pond.
8. Each lot shall maintain a native vegetative buffer of at least 100 feet from the mean high water mark along the majority of the shoreline of the pond that the lot encompasses. Native vegetative buffers, including trees, shrubs or other understory plants and a “duff” layer of leaf litter and woody debris, provide a number of environmental functions that benefit the pond and the wildlife that use the pond for drinking water and habitat. Trees and shrubs can help screen properties from the other users of the pond, preserving a pristine experience. They also provide cover for terrestrial species that use the pond for drinking water. Their root systems help bind the soil, slowing and filtering runoff, preventing erosion and maintaining water quality. The “duff” layer also serves too slow and filter runoff, improving water quality. Lastly, trees, shrubs and duff contribute woody debris, and associated insects and plants necessary to maintain the health of the near shore aquatic habitat, which supports the reproduction of many aquatic species. Accordingly, Bristol requires that each property owner along the pond serve as a steward of the pond’s resources, both for themselves and for the general public. Maintaining a natural vegetative buffer within 100’ feet of the pond for a majority of the lot frontage on the pond can look a number of different ways. Guidelines for implementing the buffer follow:
a. The duff layer is most important and should be maintained in nearly all areas within 25 feet of the pond;
b. Areas of trees and shrubs should be preserved, but may be thinned or limbed to provide viewsheds from the property to the pond, leaving the trees’ upper stories intact to provide shade and screening;
c. Grass or lawn areas should comprise a minority of the area of the shoreline, decreasing in size closer to the waterline;
9. Accessory uses/buildings will be permitted provided they meet all of the dimensional standards noted below.

Downtown Design Review Overlay (DDR)
A. Objectives and Guidelines
29
The purpose of the Downtown Design Review Overlay District is to protect the historic mixed commercial/residential character and resources within the defined area of downtown, and to encourage new construction which will reinforce the best qualities of the existing character while allowing freedom of expression compatible with the flavor and spirit of the community. The dimensions of the district are depicted as the overlay area on the Zoning Map. The overlay district contains special Regulations to be added to those of the underlying district and does not affect the zoning Regulations governing the use of the properties within such district.
B. Allowed Uses
All Allowed Uses included in the underlying district shall be allowed in the overlay district.
C. Dimensional Standards
Dimensional Standards shall remain the same as in the underlying district.
D. Design Standards
All development in the Downtown Design Review Overlay District shall be designed to attract people to Bristol’s village and, as such, shall meet the following design standards. These design standards shall be administered by the Design Review Committee (“DRC”) See Section 333 describing the DRC. The DRC shall review a project to determine if the proposed development substantially conforms to the following standards and then make recommendations to the Zoning Administrator for projects involving permitted uses or to the appropriate municipal panel for approval as part of a project requiring Site Plan, Conditional Use Review or other reviews. See Section 395 governing the process by which the DRC performs its reviews.
Building Design
1. Scale: The scale and massing of new buildings should be compatible and harmonious with surrounding structures
2. Height: The height of a building or alterations shall be considered in relation to the height of existing adjacent buildings and the building being constructed or altered.
3. Setback: The front, side and rear setbacks shall be considered in relation to the prevailing setback existing in the immediate area.
4. Proportion: The relationship between the width and height of the windows, doors and facades of adjacent buildings shall be considered in the construction or alterations of a building.
5. Materials: Materials should be selected to enhance streetscape and pedestrian view. Materials that are durable and attractive over time should be encouraged.
6. Architectural Features: Architectural features including but not limited to cornices, railings, windows, shutters, fanlights, and entablature prevailing in the immediate area should be considered- in the construction or alteration of a building. It is not intended that the details of old buildings be duplicated precisely, but they should be regarded as suggestive of the extent, nature and scale of details that would be appropriate on new buildings or alterations. The preservation of distinctive materials, features, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property is encouraged.
7. Building façade: Structural shape, placement of openings and architectural features give a predominantly vertical, horizontal or angular character to the building's front facade and should be considered in the construction or alteration of a building. Windows and doors should fit same opening or original size, be consistent with other openings in the building, and be of similar style to the rest of the building and surrounding structures.
8. Roof shape: The similarity or compatibility of roof shapes in the immediate area should be considered in the construction or alteration of a building.
9. Orientation: New buildings should be oriented toward, and related both functionally and visually to, public streets and/or common greens, parks or plazas. Consideration shall be given to buildings serving special civic, social or cultural functions, including places of worship that may be designed to serve as prominent focal points within the district.
30
10. Historic structures: When a proposed project is to be located next to a recognized historic structure, the historic and architectural value of that structure should not be diminished. Specifically, no building adjacent to Holley Hall should obscure or detract from the structure's prominence.
Lighting, Signage, Utilities and Maintenance
1. Lighting: In addition to conforming with zoning (SECTION 752), lighting fixture design, when possible, should be compatible with and sensitive to the architectural style and period of the related buildings.
2. Signage: All signs should conform to existing zoning Regulations. In addition, while creative, vibrant and artistic signs are encouraged; the size, location, design, color, texture, lighting, and material of all exterior signs should be complimentary to buildings and structures on the site and surrounding properties. Proposed signs should not block existing signs when viewed down the sidewalk or from the street.
3. Utilities: Refuse containers and utilities (including satellite dishes) should be attractively screened or buried to block them from public view. Screening material should consist of plantings that will provide screening during all seasons; structures made of wood, brick or granite in keeping with the general design of the structure. Whenever possible, utility components (Central HVAC units) should be housed within or on the top of the proposed building. When not possible, the applicant should provide evidence as to why, and offer proper screening. Any application which proposes new structures, additional lot coverage, or installation of machinery or equipment which emits heat, vapor, fumes, or noise shall include in the application descriptions of efforts to minimize, insofar as practical, any adverse impact on light, air, and water or on noise levels of the immediate surroundings.
4. Rain, Snow, Ice: Applicants should be required to develop within their proposal how they will deal with rain, snow, and ice that may affect neighboring properties or public improvements.
Landscaping
1. Landscaping: If natural features and existing landscaping are to be removed, there should be plans to replace and maintain such features and landscaping. The restoration or reestablishment of landscaping should consider such features from the surrounding properties (e.g., plant types). Open spaces should add to the visual amenities of the vicinity and surrounding properties. If open space is intended for active use, it should be so designed as to maximize its accessibility for all, encouraging social interaction.
2. Continuity: Physical elements such as yards, fences, evergreen masses, or building facades may combine to form lines of continuity along a street. These elements shall be considered in the construction or alteration of a building.
3. Fences: Fences in the Design Review District should be a maximum height of four (4) feet, except when required for vehicular screening, when the maximum height can be five (5) feet. Fences should be compatible with the architectural style/period of building. The structural supports of the fence should face the interior of the lot and no chain link fences should be allowed, unless other state guidelines supersede.
4. Hardscaping: Materials should be chosen for their longevity and for their compatibility with the existing structure and adjacent properties. An appropriate mix of materials is encouraged. Large areas of poured concrete or cement should be discouraged.
5. Less Visible Areas: The design standards contained herein shall be reasonably applied to have a limited or no effect on rear yards and side yards that are not generally visible by the public.
Parking and Pedestrian Circulation
1. Parking/Vehicle and Pedestrian Circulation: New construction or renovations should not take up existing parking spaces. Applications should address pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Special attention should be given to the
31
safe separation of vehicles and pedestrians, to the arrangement of parking areas, and to service and loading areas. Applications shall incorporate accessible routes and ramps for individuals with a disability.
32

The Z.A. may require an accurate drawing of the property showing existing features, including structure locations, driveways, easements, traffic circulation, parking and loading spaces and pedestrian walks, and landscaping plans and other information pertinent to the issue and depicting proposed non-substantial change for which the permit is being sought.
The Z.A. may grant a permit including an administrative change for non-substantial changes to previously approved development or new development, which constitutes a by right use without requiring Site Plan approval, if the applicant can satisfy the following standards:
1. The permit requested is for a temporary structure or a use permitted within the district in question as by right use (as opposed to a conditional use);
2. The permit requested is in conformance with the Town Plan and the goals set forth in SECTION 4302 of the Act;
3. The permit requested is designed to conform to the character of the land use area in which it lies as defined in the Town Plan and further designed to reasonably limit impact or the potential for impact upon ones’ neighbors;

The Z.A. shall make a decision on the request for a permit or permit amendment by applying the facts presented in the application to the criteria, listed above, and incorporating all into a decision. In approving a project, the Z.A. shall act to ensure, and may impose conditions requiring that the permit, if authorized, will represent the minimum amendment that will afford relief and will represent a non-substantive deviation possible from the previous approval and conforms to these Regulations and the Plan. The nature of any permit amendment and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the Zoning Permit, incorporated therein and shall be enforceable in the same manner as all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.

To that end, the conditional use shall meet the dimensional setback requirements for the district, the sign standards indicated in Article VII, and any other performance standards specified in these Regulations. The estimated traffic generated by a conditional use shall not exhaust or exceed the capacity of the road to accept increased traffic unless the applicant agrees to a condition requiring the applicant to upgrade the road.
3. Traffic Impacts. The estimated traffic generated by a conditional use shall not, in combination with other uses, exceed the capacity of the roads and highways in its vicinity, and the ZBA may require a traffic study to determine whether the capacity of the roads will be exceeded. Where the capacity of the road to accept increased traffic is limited, the conditional use shall not exhaust or exceed the remaining capacity of the road.
4. Compliance with Regulations. A conditional use must comply with Regulations in effect at the time of submission of the application.

SECTION 373: REVIEW CRITERIA
The ZBA shall review all variance requests to determine if they meet all of the following standards:
1. There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of the lot or topography or other physical conditions on the property and that the hardship is due to these conditions and not the circumstances or provisions of the bylaw in the district in which the property is located;

3. Unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
4. The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located; substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property; reduce access to renewable resources or be detrimental to the public welfare;
5. The variance will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the Town Plan and these Regulations.

SECTION 390: SITE PLAN REVIEW, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REVIEW, DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW AND OTHER APPLICATIONS (SECTIONs 390 – 396)
SECTION 391: GENERAL CONDITIONS
Any Site Plan review, Planned Unit Development Review or other applications or uses that require approval of an appropriate municipal panel, but are not specifically listed in SECTIONs 331 or 332 of these Regulations shall be reviewed under the procedure immediately below.
Site Plan approval by the Planning Commission shall be required for proposed uses allowed “by right” within any given zoning district, that are identified by an asterisk within the District Use standards in Article II, SECTION 230 of these Regulations. Unlike Conditional Use approval, Site Plan approval assumes that the use proposed is appropriate for the district in which it is located. As such, Site Plan review focuses solely on proper development within the site, not its compatibility or lack thereof with the surrounding area. Site Plan review cannot be used to deny a project in the same way that conditional use criteria would. However, the appropriate municipal panel may place conditions on any approval it gives to implement the objectives of the Town Plan as contemplated in the criteria below.
Development subject to Conditional Use review shall, also be subject to the Site Plan review criteria as part of the Conditional Use review. The ZBA shall apply the criteria and procedure cited below as the second portion of its Conditional Use review of the project and may impose appropriate conditions within any permit it chooses to grant under those reviews.
Planned Unit Development Review and other reviews shall be conducted by the Planning Commission pursuant to the criteria below.
SECTION 392: APPLICATION FOR SITE PLAN, PLANNED UNIT
48
DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER APPROVALS
The owner shall submit one (1) set of plan maps and supporting data to the appropriate municipal panel, by delivering the application to the Z.A. or filing the application at the Town Clerk’s office. The application shall include the application requirements from SECTION 353 of these Regulations that specifically relate to the Site Plan Review criteria, and, for Planned Unit Developments, the application material contained in SECTION 609 of these Regulations.
SECTION 393: PUBLIC NOTICE AND REVIEW
Public notice of hearing shall be given as specified in SECTION 340(1)(b) of these Regulations if conducted independently or under SECTION 340(1)(a) if conducted as a portion of a Conditional Use review. The appropriate municipal panel shall review this application pursuant to the review procedure established in SECTION 340(2) of these Regulations and pursuant to any rules of procedure it adopts.
SECTION 394: SITE PLAN REVIEW CRITERIA
The appropriate municipal panel may impose appropriate conditions and safeguards only with respect to the adequacy of traffic access, circulation and parking for vehicles and pedestrians, landscaping and screening, exterior lighting, signs, hours of operation, design criteria for the exterior of the building proposed and protecting the utilization of renewable energy resources as defined by the criteria below. The appropriate municipal panel shall review the site plan map and supporting data, taking into consideration the objectives listed in SECTION 356 of these Regulations which contains the Site Plan Review standards.
For Planned Unit Developments, the Planning Commission may also review the application pursuant to the additional criteria contained in SECTION 609 of these Regulations. For other types of review, the Planning Commission may include other criteria specifically enabled within these Regulations.
SECTION 395: ADDITIONAL SITE APPROVAL CRITERIA IN OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Bristol has created two overlay districts: The Downtown Design Review Overlay District and the Flood Hazard Overlay Area. The overlay districts impose additional site design standards on applicable projects within those districts. The appropriate municipal panel shall add the design review criteria from the Flood Hazard Overlay District contained in Article VIII of these Regulations as additional criteria for review and conditions of its decisions for projects within that overlay area.
Within the Downtown Design Review Overlay District also described in Article II, Section 230, the DRC shall review all applicable projects pursuant to the design review criteria from the Downtown Design Review Overlay district. The DRC shall make recommendations to the Z.A. or appropriate municipal panel, responsible for permitting the applicant. The Z.A. shall incorporate the recommendations of the DRC into any permit they issue. The appropriate municipal panel shall review the recommendations of the DRC and may incorporate those recommendations it deem appropriate into its decision.
49
SECTION 396: DECISIONS
Upon the close of the hearing, the appropriate municipal panel shall issue its decision or pursuant to the procedure outlined in SECTION 340(3) of these Regulations. In approving a project with conditions, the appropriate municipal panel may require specific modifications to the design, scale, layout and/or design or configuration of the project.
SECTION 399: APPEALS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT
An “interested person” who has participated in a proceeding before the appropriate municipal panel (the ZBA or Planning Commission, depending upon the type of application) may appeal a decision rendered in that proceeding to the Environmental Court. Participation in a local regulatory proceeding shall consist of offering, through oral or written testimony, evidence or a statement of concern related to the subject of the proceeding. An appeal from a decision of the appropriate municipal panel shall be taken in such a manner as the Supreme Court may by rule provide for appeals from State agencies governed by 3 V.S.A. §§ 801 - 816. Notice of the appeal shall be filed by certified mailing, with fees, to the Environmental Court and by mailing a copy to the municipal clerk or the administrative officer, if so designated, who shall supply a list of interested persons to the appellant within five working days. Upon receipt of the list of interested persons, the appellant shall, by certified mail, provide a copy of the notice of appeal to every interested person, and, if any one or more of those persons are not then parties to the appeal, upon motion they shall be granted leave by the court to intervene.
ARTICLE IV: REQUIRED REGULATIONS
SECTION 400: REQUIRED REGULATIONS
The uses permitted within each district as noted in Article II shall also be subject to such additions, modifications, or exceptions as provided by the following Regulations.
SECTION 401: PROMOTE AND PROTECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Except as provided in 24 V.S.A. § 4414(1)(E) and (F), nothing in these Regulations will treat mobile homes, modular housing or other forms of prefabricated housing differently from any other single-family dwelling type. Nothing in these Regulations will be construed to prevent the establishment of mobile home parks pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 153. Nothing in these Regulations will have the effect of excluding affordable housing to meet the needs of the low and moderate income citizens as determined by studies described in 24 V.S.A. § 4382(c).
SECTION 402: MOBILE, MANUFACTURED OR PREFABRICATED HOMES
Mobile, manufactured or prefabricated homes shall be considered the same as conventional homes except in a mobile home park.
SECTION 403: MOBILE HOME PARKS
Mobile homes are permitted in approved mobile home parks subject to the requirements of this SECTION and State law. Existing Mobile Home Parks shall be considered pre-existing non-conforming uses, unless they specifically comply with all provisions of these Regulations. Nothing in these Regulations shall prohibit the replacement or improvement of homes on lots in existing parks. New Mobile Home Parks shall be allowed under the PUD provisions of these Regulations on the same terms and conditions as Bristol may allow any other type of housing in a specific area as governed by these Regulations.
50
SECTION 404: ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT
An accessory dwelling unit that is located within or appurtenant to an owner-occupied one-family dwelling shall be a permitted use. An accessory dwelling unit shall be defined as an efficiency or one-bedroom apartment, located within or appurtenant to an owner-occupied single-family dwelling, that is clearly subordinate to a one-family dwelling, and has facilities and provisions for independent living, including sleeping, food preparation, and sanitation, provided there is compliance with all the following:
1. The owner occupies either the primary dwelling or accessory dwelling.

3. The accessory unit does not exceed the greater of 30 percent of the total habitable floor area of the single-family dwelling or 1,000 sq. ft.
4. Applicable setback, coverage, and parking requirements specified in these Regulations are met.
Any accessory dwelling unit, new or existing, that meets the above conditions is a permitted use in all districts. However, any new accessory dwelling unit, or revision to an existing accessory dwelling unit, requires a conditional use permit if it results in:
? A violation of any of the above conditions or,
? A new accessory structure or,
? An increase in the height or floor area of the existing dwelling or,
? An increase in the dimensions of the parking areas,
? Neither unit is owner-occupied.
SECTION 405: EXISTING SMALL LOTS
Any lot in individual and separate and non-affiliated ownership from surrounding properties in existence on November 30, 1983 may be developed for the purposes permitted in the district in which it is located, even though not conforming to minimum lot size requirements, if such lot is not less than one-eight acre in area with a minimum width or depth dimension of forty feet.
Any pre-existing small lots that were or came into contiguous ownership as of May 27, 1998 or thereafter and were deemed automatically merged, may be re-subdivided along the pre-existing lines. Applicants shall demonstrate that they possessed legally created, separate lots prior to the automatic merger. The Planning Commission shall evaluate the material presented by the applicant applying the procedures and criteria contained in SECTIONs 390-396 of these Regulations applicable to “Other Permits”.
SECTION 406: RESIDENTIAL CARE HOME OR GROUP HOME
A residential care home or group home to be operated under state licensing or registration, serving not more than 8 persons who have a disability as defined in 9 V.S.A. 4501 shall be considered by right to constitute a permitted single family residential use of property, except that no such home shall be so considered if it is located within a thousand feet of another existing or permitted such home.
SECTION 407: REQUIRED FRONTAGE
No land development may be permitted on lots which do not have either frontage on a public road or, access to such a road by a permanent easement or right-of-way at least 35 feet in width for permitted uses and 50 feet in width for conditional uses. Any proposed right of way must be
51
approved by the Planning Commission. See SECTION 720 of these Regulations governing access for additional access requirements.
SECTION 408: PROTECTION OF HOME OCCUPATIONS (See also SECTION 606 Regarding Home Business).
Home occupations are permitted, by right, in all districts in which single-family residences are allowed. No regulation herein is intended to infringe upon the right of any resident to use a minor portion of a dwelling for an occupation which is customary in residential or rural areas and which does not have an undue adverse impact on the character of the residential area. A Zoning Permit application shall be submitted to the Z.A. so that a determination can be made as to whether the proposed use is, in fact, a home occupation as defined by these Regulations.
The Z.A. shall use the following criteria to determine whether a proposed use is a home occupation:
1. The business shall be operated by a resident in the principal building.
2. The business shall be operated wholly within the principal building and no goods, materials, or products shall be publicly displayed on the premises.
3. Not more than two persons other than the residents shall be employed or conduct business from the premises.
4. There shall be no exterior storage of materials, and no other exterior indication of the home occupation, except signs are permitted as specified in ARTICLE VII;
5. The use shall not attract excessive vehicular traffic and shall satisfy the parking and access requirements contained in SECTIONs 710-720 of these Regulations.
6. The use shall not violate the Performance Standards contained in SECTION 750 and 751 of these Regulations governing odors, fumes, or noises; and
7. Retail operations are allowed as a portion of the Home Occupation but should be secondary to the Home Occupation’s primary function.
SECTION 409: CHILDCARE HOME
Various types of “family childcare homes or facilities” are defined in SECTION 900 of these Regulations. As per the definition, family childcare homes serving 6 or fewer children shall be considered to constitute a permitted single-family residential use and shall be allowed in all districts on the same basis as a single-family residential use. A family child care home serving no more than six full-time children and four part-time children, as defined in 33 V.S.A. § 4902(3)(A), shall be considered to constitute a permitted use of property but will require site plan approval. A family childcare facility serving more than six full-time and four part-time children shall be reviewed pursuant to the uses allowed in the district in which it is located.
SECTION 410: HEIGHT OF CERTAIN STRUCTURES
No structure shall exceed the maximum district height requirements except for specified exempt structures listed below or those as allowed hereunder:

SECTION 411: NON-CONFORMITIES
A non-conformity includes non-conforming uses, structures, lots or parcels. Definitions of each of these types of “non-conformities” are contained within the “Definitions” in Article IX, SECTION 900 of these Regulations. The following provisions shall apply to all buildings and uses existing on the effective date of these Regulations which do not conform to the requirements set forth in these Regulations and to all buildings and uses that in the future do not conform by reason of any subsequent amendment to these Regulations. The intent of this section is not to discontinue all non-conformities. Accordingly, it grants the ZBA authority to continue non-conforming uses where it deems that continuation appropriate and meeting these Regulations after a public hearing.
Any non-conforming use of structures or land except those specified below, may be continued indefinitely, but:
1. Shall not be moved, enlarged, altered, extended, reconstructed or restored (except as provided below), nor shall any external evidence of such use be increased by any means whatsoever, without approval by the ZBA, and then only after a public hearing carried out pursuant to the provisions governing a conditional use review in SECTIONs 350-358 in a manner, which, in the opinion of the ZBA does not enlarge the nature of the non-conformance.
2. Shall not be changed to another non-conforming use without approval by the ZBA, and then only after a public hearing carried out pursuant to the provisions governing a conditional use review in SECTIONs 350-358 and only to a use, which, in the opinion of the ZBA is of the same or of a more restricted nature.
3. Shall not be re-established if such use has discontinued for a period of two years or has been changed to, or replaced by, a conforming use without approval by the ZBA, unless after a public hearing carried out pursuant to the provisions governing a conditional use review in SECTIONs 350-358 it changes to a use, which, in the opinion of the Board, is of the same or of a more restricted nature. Intent to resume a non-conforming use shall not confer the right to do so.
4. Shall not be restored for other than a conforming use after damage from any cause unless the non-conforming use is reinstated by the completion of construction and restoration of such building within two years; otherwise, the non-conforming use of such building shall be deemed to have been discontinued, unless such non-conforming use is carried on uninterrupted in the damaged part of the building.
53
5. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of a non-conforming building provided that such action does not increase the degree of non-conformance.
SECTION 412: SPECIAL PUBLIC USE EXCEPTIONS
Pursuant to 24 V.S.A. § 4413, Bristol shall regulate the following uses only with respect to location, size, height, building bulk, yards, courts, setbacks, density of buildings, off-street parking, loading facilities, traffic, noise, lighting, landscaping or screening requirements and only to the extent that these Regulations do not have the effect of interfering with the intended functional use:

It is the intent of these Regulations to regulate these facilities to the maximum extent allowable under law. The uses noted above shall be subject to review by the Planning Commission pursuant to the applicable procedure and criteria governing Site Plan Review under Article III of these Regulations and any other portion of these Regulations that pertain to aspects of the project that may be regulated.
54

SECTION 504: CONSTRUCTION APPROVED PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF OR AMENDMENT TO REGULATIONS
No permit shall be required for any structure upon which construction had begun prior to the adoption of these Regulations, provided such construction is completed within one year from the date of such adoption. The Town shall not require any change in the plans for, or construction of, a structure or use for which a zoning permit has been issued and which has subsequently been made non-complying or non-conforming by an amendment to these Regulations if the activities authorized by the zoning permit are completed while the permit is valid.
SECTION 505: ABANDONMENT OF STRUCTURES
Within one year after work on an excavation for a structure has begun or within one year after a permanent or temporary structure has been destroyed, demolished or abandoned, all structural materials shall be removed from the site, and the excavation thus remaining shall be covered over or filled to the normal grade and, to prevent erosion and improve aesthetics, the owner shall establish permanent vegetative cover.
SECTION 506: TEMPORARY USES AND STRUCTURES
Temporary permits may be issued by the Zoning Administrator for the period not exceeding one year after approval by the ZBA for non-conforming uses incidental to construction projects, provided such permits are conditional upon agreement by the owner to remove the structure or
55
use upon expiration of the permit. Such permits may be renewed upon application for an additional period not exceeding one year.
SECTION 507: DWELLING UNITS BELOW GRADE
The finished floor level of all habitable rooms in every two-family and multiple-family dwelling unit shall be not more than four feet below finished grade level measured at a point ten feet outside and at right angles to each window lighting each habitable room.
SECTION 508: FILLING OF LAND
In any district a zoning permit is required for the depositing of rock, concrete, stone, gravel, sand, cinders, stumps, and soil used for the filling of land. The Zoning Administrator may issue a permit provided the applicant demonstrates the activity will not significantly alter existing drainage patterns, cause soil erosion, or result in any hazard or expense to the community. State laws governing the filling of land must be adhered to.
SECTION 509: REDUCTION OF LOT AREA
No lot shall be so reduced in area that the area, yards, frontage, coverage, or other requirements of these Regulations do not conform to the requirements herein prescribed for each district. The provisions of this SECTION shall not apply when part of a lot is taken for a public purpose.
SECTION 510: REQUIRED AREA OR YARDS

Additionally, certain architectural features needed for the operation of active and passive solar energy systems, including but not limited to overhangs, detached solar collectors, reflectors, and piping may be permitted by the ZBA to project into the required yard if conformance with yard requirements will cause undue or unusual difficulties. Steps may be extended into a yard.
SECTION 512: CORNER LOT EXCEPTIONS
Any yard adjoining a road shall be considered a front yard. For the purposes of these Regulations, a comer lot shall be considered to have only front yards and side yards.
SECTION 513: WATERSIDE PROTECTION
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, Flood Hazard Area Regulations, or any other Regulations herein, any new structure, enlargement of an existing structure or extraction operations bordering on perennial streams shall be set back at least 50 feet from the top of bank of said stream. This requirement does not apply to a body of water that is completely surrounded by land belonging to a single owner. Nor does it apply to Bristol Pond, which is subject to the State of Vermont Shoreland Protection Regulations, the Bristol Pond Camp District, which has its own setbacks or to bridges, culverts, utilities, hydrogenation facilities or other structures that must cross or operate in streams to function. All structures crossing or operating within streams
56
are subject to State permits, including, but not limited to Stream Alteration Permits. Additionally, all owners should also be aware they may need to secure state permits before removing trees or other vegetation within a river or stream corridor.
SECTION 514: GRADING
No grading, cutting, or filling shall be carried out in any district which leaves the slope of the finished grade in excess of one to two.
