SCHEDULE I
CALCULATING THE RPARTOA CHARGES
The rpartoa charge for each property where utilities are
to become available by installation of a utility extension will be
based on a point system according to the length of frontage
acreage and distance from the origin of the extension to the
end point of frontage
For properties adjoining the rwoigahfyt where the extension
is located or adjoining either side of an alley easement or unpaved
road points will be computed as follows
l0 points per lineal foot of frontage
500 points per acre of land
01 points per acre per lineal foot of distance from origin
of the extension to the end of the properties frontage
01 multiplied by the number of acres mbultipylied the length
of the extension
The monetary value of each point is obtained by dividing
the total number of points for all properties concerned into tel
total cost of the line extension less the amount of participation
by the City or any other governmental agency and each property
is then assessed proportionally by its number of points
For properties where adequate water and sewer lines are
already available on one side a credit shall be applied as follows
Reduce the total number of points for the property by fifty percent 50
in the calculations See Parcel A in the attached Example for Schedule I
In making the calculations it will be determined in advance
which properties the utility extension is designed for and capable of
serving Each of these parcels of property will then be included in
the calculations If it is reasonably certain that a property will never
tie on to the system it will be omitted from the calculations Any
property owner would have to pay a rpartoa share based on the number of
points for his property times the same cost per point that was used to
calculate the other properties share
Pg 2
Schedule I
Properties that do not front on the utility extension
rwoigahfyt but will be served by the extension are still
subject to the rpartoa assessment The number of points are
calculated the same way Schedule I but the points for the
front footage are omitted This is to offset the costs of
running a line from the utility extension to the property

THAT
SECTION L AUmORITY
This Ordinance is adopted under the authority ofthe Constitution andthe Laws ofthe State of
Texas andis hereby incremented as part ofthe Code of Ordinances ofthe City ofMercedes Texas
SECTION IL PURPOSE
The purpose ofthis Ordinance is to provide the orderly safe andhealthful development ofthe
community and to promote the health safety and general welfare ofthe City of Mercedes Texas
SECTION IlL OBJECTIVES
A The objective ofthis Ordinance is to establish requirements for the installation and
maintenance oflandscape elements andothermeans ofsite improvements in offstreet parking
areas and other developedproperties The justification for such an Ordinance is threefold
1 To aid inregulating andcontrolling vehicular andpedestrian circulation inparking areas
2 To enhance the community s ecological or environmental andaesthetic qualities and
3 To protect andconserve the value ofproperty
B The present process ofdevelopment has a negative effect onthe ecological balance of an area
Paved surfaces automobiles buildings and other improvements all produce great increases in
air temperatures a problem especially noticeablein this southern region whereas plants have
the opposite effect through transpiration andthe creation of shade Likewise impervious
surfaces created by development generate greater water runoff causing problems from erosion
and flooding This is a particular relevant concern in the Mercedes andthe surrounding area
due to the lack of gradient and drainage access to the ocean and the consequent need to
prevent upsetting the hydrological balance that has evolved
C The increase number size and complexity of offstreet parking areas serving ever larger
commercial industrial andother facilities indicates a need for proper traffic control and
vehicular andpedestrian movement or circulation in order to avoid a potential danger to the
people s health safety and welfare
D The importance of presemng and improving the natural environment andmaintaining a
working ecological balance is ofincreasing concern The fact that the use oflandscape
elements caneffectively aid in the control of traffic and at the same time can contribute to the
processed ofair purification oxygen regeneration water absorption and noise glare andheat
abatement as well as the preservation ofthe community s aesthetic qualities indicates that the
use oflandscape elements is ofbenefit to the health welfare and general well being ofthe
community and therefore it is proper that the use of such elements be required

The “zone” of a piece of property determines what type of land use is allowable on the tract, setbacks and landscaping required among other things. The City of Mercedes currently has sixteen categories of zoning.

Zoning Categories
“N – Newly Annexed” – primarily a holding category when land is annexed into the city limits and only allows single family residences and other uses allowed in an “A – Single Family Residence” district

“A – Single Family Residence” – allows single family dwellings, public park, churches, golf course, farms, groves and orchards and requires a minimum lot width of 100’ with a minimum total area of 14,000 square feet and a 40’ front yard setback.

“A-1 – Single Family Residence” – allows everything allowed in the above zones but on smaller lots (60’ width with minimum area of 8,400 square feet) with a slightly smaller front yard setback (30’).

“A-2 – Single Family Residence” – allows everything allowed in the above zones but on smaller lots (50’ width with minimum area of 7,000 square feet).

“B – Two Family Residence” – allows everything in the above zones plus two family residences on minimum 60’ wide lots with a minimum of 8400 square feet in area.

“B-1 – Two Family Residence” – allows everything in the above zones on minimum 50’ wide lots with a minimum of 7,000 square feet in area.

“C – Apartment” – allows everything in the above zones plus apartment buildings and hotels in which rooms are rented to guests, hospitals, and clinics on minimum 60’ wide lots with a minimum of 8,400 square feet in area.

“C-1 – Apartment” – allows everything in the above zones on minimum 50’ wide lots with a minimum of 7,000 square feet in area.

“RMH – Mobile Home” – allows mobile homes, modular homes, recreational vehicles, single family homes and recreational/commercial facilities designed for the exclusive use of a mobile home park. (See Ordinance #86-4 for more information.)

“L – Local Retail” – allows everything allowable in a “C-1 Apartment” zone plus light retail uses typically used by neighborhood residents. No uses selling liquor, beer or wine and no uses open before 7 a.m. or after 10 p.m. shall be allowed in this district. (See Ordinance #26 for specific uses listed.)

“A – Business” – allows everything allowed in “L – Local Retail” plus medium intensity retail uses including restaurants, studios, and other retail uses provided it is not noxious or offensive by reason of emission of odors, filth, soot, dust, noise, gas fumes or is unsightly. (See Ordinance #26 for specific uses listed.)

“B – Business” – allows everything allowed in “A – Business” zone plus auto and truck type uses, heavier retail uses that might not be suitable right up against single family residential uses without a buffer of sorts. Uses shall not include those uses listed under “C – Business”, “A – Industrial”, or “B – Industrial”. (See Ordinance #26 for specific uses listed.)

“C – Business” – is the heaviest retail district and allows everything allowed in a “B – Business” zone plus limited manufacturing uses, but excluding uses set out in “A – Industrial” and “B – Industrial” zones. (See Ordinance #26 for specific uses listed.)

“A – Industrial” – is a medium intensity industrial category and allows everything allowed in “C – Business” zone plus adding some more intensive manufacturing and processing uses, except not those uses listed in “B – Industrial” zone. (See Ordinance #26 for specific uses listed.)

“B – Industrial” – is the heaviest industrial category and allows everything allowed in “A – Industrial” zone plus any manufacturing or industrial processes not heretofore listed and not otherwise prohibited by law or ordinance. (See Ordinance #26 for specific uses listed.)

“LI – Light Industrial” zone – is intended to be a limited industrial zone that provides for industrial uses that may be appropriate for an industrial park or similar type of development. This limits the uses to significantly restrict the outside activities and storage of materials, noise vibration, smoke, pollution, fire and explosive hazard, glare and any other potentially blighting influences. It is intended for manufacturing that is within a totally enclosed building, suitable for high-visibility locations such as along the freeway or within a reasonable distance of residential uses. Specific additional uses can be found in Ordinance #86-15.

Rezoning
Rezoning processes can take 45 – 60 days depending on when you submit in the monthly cycle of meetings. Staff reviews an application for completion, processes payment and does the technical processes. This includes a site inspection of the property and its surroundings, a review of available infrastructure, a legal notification of all property owners within 200’ of the property and a notice in the newspaper a specified period of time prior to a public hearing being held at the Planning & Zoning Commission. The city staff will prepare a recommendation which will be send to the Planning & Zoning Commission prior to the meeting. The Planning & Zoning Commission will hear staff recommendations and any public comments at their meeting before making a decision whether or not to recommend approval to the City Commission. The City Commission will only hear the item if Planning & Zoning Commission recommends it for approval. If they deny the item, the applicant has the option to appeal their decision directly to City Commission. If it passes to the City Commission, they must hear it on two meetings to pass an ordinance required to complete the rezoning process.
