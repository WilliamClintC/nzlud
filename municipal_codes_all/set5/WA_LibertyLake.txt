to hear and decide various quasi-judicial matters. By adopting a hearing
examiner system, the legal effect of the hearing examiner decisions shall
depending on the matter be: 1) a recommendation to the city council; 2) an
administrative decision appealable to the city council; or 3) except for a
rezone of property, a final decision of the city council. The mayor shall
recommend execution of a contract for the services of a hearing examiner who
shall conduct public hearings and render decisions on matters delegated by the
city council. (Ord. 30, 8-7-2001)

shall any member of the legislative body who has such an interest or has had
such contacts participate in the consideration thereof. This is not intended to

question, or to produce upon reasonable notice any material or property books

council. Wherever existing ordinances, codes or policies authorize or direct
the board of adjustment, planning commission or other official, boards or

(Ord. 27, 8-7-2001)
1-9-9: RECONSIDERATION:

fourteen (14) days of the date the decision is rendered. This request must set
forth the specific errors or new information relied upon by such appellant. The

rendered. The city council shall hold a hearing on the appeal.
Such appeal must be upon the record, established and made at the hearing,
provided that new evidence which was not available at the time of the hearing

errors, omissions from the record, errors in the interpretation of the
comprehensive plan or new evidence which was not available at the time of the

CHAPTER 10
CODE OF ETHICS
SECTION:
1-10-1: Declaration Of Policy
1-10-2: Purpose; Violations Enumerated
1-10-3: Nepotism
1-10-4: Social Media
1-10-5: Disclosure
1-10-6: Civil Penalties
1-10-7: Responsibilities Of Hearing Examiner
1-10-8: Enforcement Procedures
1-10-9: False Charge Of Misconduct
1-10-1: DECLARATION OF POLICY:
High moral and ethical standards among public officials and public employees
are essential to gain and maintain the confidence of the public because such
confidence is essential to the conduct of free government. Public officials and
public employees are agents of the people and hold their positions for the
benefit of the people. The proper operation of democratic government requires
that public officials and employees be independent and impartial when
establishing policy and that their positions never be used for personal gain. A
code of ethical conduct is necessary for the guidance of public officials where
conflicts do occur as well as to prevent conflicts of interest. (Ord. 234, 12-
20-2016)
1-10-2: PURPOSE; VIOLATIONS ENUMERATED:
   A.   The purpose of the code of ethics is to assist city officials in
establishing guidelines to govern their own conduct as it relates to official
city business. The code is also intended to help develop traditions of
responsible public service. This code of ethics shall apply to all members of
the city council, planning commission, and other city boards and commissions
(hereinafter collectively "representatives"). A representative shall be deemed
to have violated this code of ethics if he or she:
      1.   Receives or has any financial interest in any sale to or by the city
of any service or property when such financial interest was received with the
prior knowledge that the city intended to purchase such property or obtain such
service;
      2.   Accepts or seeks for others any service, information or thing of
value on more favorable terms than those granted to the public generally, from
any person, firm or corporation having dealings with the city;
      3.   Accepts any gift or favor from any person, firm or corporation
having any dealings with the city if he or she knows or has reason to know that
it was intended to obtain special consideration;
      4.   Influences the selection of or the conduct of business with a
corporation, person or firm having business with the city if he or she
personally or through household relatives has financial interest in or with the
corporation, person or firm;
      5.   Is an employee, officer, partner, director or consultant of any
corporation, firm or person having business with the city, unless he or she has
disclosed such relationship as provided by this chapter; provided, that nothing
herein shall be deemed to apply to consultants who render professional advice
to corporations, firms or persons on matters unrelated to the business with the
city. This provision shall not apply if the official or employee disqualifies
himself or herself from all participation in the city business with the
corporation, firm or person;
      6.   Engages in or accepts private employment or renders services for
private industry when such employment or service is incompatible with the
proper discharge of his or her official duties, would impair his or her
independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official
duties, or would require or induce him or her to disclose confidential
information acquired by reason of his or her official position;
      7.   Appears on behalf of a private interest before any regulatory
governmental agency against the interest of the city, or represents a private
interest in any action or proceeding against the interest of the city in any
litigation to which the city is a party, unless he or she has a personal
interest and this personal interest has been disclosed to the regulatory
governmental agency. A city council member may appear before regulatory
governmental agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of his or her
duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or
civic obligations; however, no representative shall accept a retainer or
compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by a city agency;
      8.   Directly or indirectly possess a substantial or controlling interest
in any business entity which conducts business or contracts with the city, or
in the sale of real estate, materials, supplies or services to the city,
without disclosing such interest as provided by this chapter. An interest is
not a substantial interest if such interest does not exceed one-tenth of one
percent of the outstanding securities of the business concern; or, if the
interest is an unincorporated business concern, one percent (1%) of the net
worth of such concern, or the financial interest of a corporation, person or
firm does not exceed five percent (5%) of the net worth of the employee and his
or her household relatives;
      9.   As a city council member, has a financial or other private interest
in any legislation or other matters coming before the council and fails to
disclose such an interest on the records of the city council. This provision
shall not apply if the city council member disqualifies himself or herself from
voting by stating the nature and extent of such interest. Any other official or
employee who has a financial or other private interest, and who participates in
discussion with or gives an official opinion to the city council and fails to
disclose on the records of the city council the nature and extent of such
interest is in violation of this chapter;
      10.   Violates any ordinance or resolution of the city;
      11.   Discloses confidential information gained by reason of his or her
official position or otherwise uses such information for his or her personal
gain or benefit;
      12.   Makes any false statement or representation of any public record or
document in a wilful disregard of the truth of such statement or
representation;
      13.   Requests or permits the use of city owned vehicles, equipment,
materials or property for personal convenience, improper purposes, or profit,
except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided
as city policy for the use of such official in the conduct of official
business;
      14.   Grants any special consideration, treatment or advantage beyond
that which is available to every other citizen in similar circumstances;
      15.   Knowingly and in wilful disregard of section
1-10-3 of this chapter violates or influences any other person to violate the
nepotism policy set forth in section
1-10-3 of this chapter;
      16.   Violates any provision of chapter 42.20 or 42.23 Revised Code Of
Washington;
      17.   Violates the appearance of fairness doctrine in chapter 42.36
Revised Code Of Washington. (Ord. 234, 12-20-2016)
1-10-3: NEPOTISM:
   A.   In order to prevent conflicts of interest, the city limits employment
of immediate family, as defined in these policies, under any or all of the
following circumstances:
      1.   Where an immediate family member would have authority (or practical
power) to supervise, appoint, remove, or discipline the other;
      2.   Where an immediate family member would be responsible for auditing
the work of the other;
      3.   Where both parties would report to the same immediate supervisor;
      4.   Where, in order to avoid the reality or appearance of improper
influence or favor, or to protect confidentiality, the city must limit the
employment of immediate family members of policy level officers of any agency
or organization currently dealing with the city or which could reasonably be
expected to deal with the city in the future;
      5.   Where other circumstances might lead to potential conflict among the
parties or conflict between the interest of one or both parties and the best
interests of the city;
      6.   Where an immediate family member, other than a spouse, is a member
of the city council. If an employee's spouse is a city council member, then a
prohibited conflict of interest exists if any or all of subsections A1 through
A4 of this section apply.
   B.   For purposes of this section, "immediate family" means the public
official's or employee's spouse, registered domestic partner, child, parent,
brother and sister, mother and father-in- law, son and daughter-in-law, aunt
and uncle, grandparents, grandchildren, or step relatives or domestic partner
relatives in one of these relationships. (Ord. 234, 12-20-2016)
1-10-4: SOCIAL MEDIA:
   A.   Purpose; Applicability And Standards; Authority:
      1.   This section identifies the roles, responsibilities, and best
practice recommendations for the use of social media by city representatives.
The city is committed to open and progressive communications between its
representatives and their constituents utilizing available and future online
technologies within the limits of the law.
      2.   This policy applies to any social media site or tool used by
representatives in their official or employment capacity to communicate with
constituents or the general public. Where indicated, certain provisions of this
policy shall apply only to social media sites/tools that are owned or
maintained by the city of Liberty Lake, including sites/tools that are
established by the city for its representatives. It is primarily each
representative's responsibility to ensure compliance with this policy.
      3.   It is the city's preference and intent that representatives will not
utilize social media to communicate in their official or employment capacity
except through social media sites/tools that are owned or maintained by the
city of Liberty Lake. The use of private social media sites/tools for this
purpose is strongly discouraged.
      4.   While social media, with its use of popular abbreviations and
shorthand, does not adhere to standard conventions of correspondence, the
content and tenor of online conversations, discussions, and information posts
and comments should model the same professional behavior displayed during
council meetings and community meetings.
      5.   Social media are not to be used by representatives as mechanisms for
conducting official city business other than to informally communicate with the
public. Examples of business that may not be conducted through social media
include: making policy decisions, official public noticing, and discussing
confidential city matters that have not been approved for release to the
public. Representatives' social media site(s) should contain links directing
users back to the city's official website for in depth information, forms,
documents, or online services necessary to conduct official city business.
      6.   The city administrator shall have primary responsibility to
administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter with respect to social
media sites/tools that are owned or maintained by the city of Liberty Lake. The
city administrator may cause categories of official city of Liberty Lake social
media applications, tools, or sites to be permanently or temporarily
discontinued if they are not or cannot be used in compliance with this policy.
The city administrator shall exercise such discretion in a viewpoint neutral,
evenhanded, and nonarbitrary manner. If representatives are aggrieved by an
administrative decision or enforcement action of the city administrator they
may request an informal hearing with the hearing examiner to challenge such
decision or action consistent with section
1-10-8 of this chapter.
   B.   Definitions: As used in this section, the following shall be defined
as:
    CHAT: A feature that allows instant messages to be sent.

Liberty Lake city council, and any employees working on behalf of said member
(s) to represent him or her, using a social media tool.
   COMMENT: A response to a post, an article or other social media content
submitted by a visitor.
   LIKE: A feature that allows users to show their support for specific
comments, pictures, wall posts, statuses, or fan pages. The "like" button
allows users to show their appreciation for content without having to make a
written comment.
   MAYOR: Includes the mayor of the city of Liberty Lake and any employees
working on behalf of the mayor to represent him or her, using a social media
tool.
   POST: An original entry onto a social media site by the user of the site.

the city of Liberty Lake city council, planning commission, and other city
board and commission members.
   SHARING: To relay a previously created post onto a different social media
site.
   SOCIAL MEDIA: Third party hosted online technologies that facilitate social
interactions and dialogue. These online technologies are operated by noncity
hosted services and may be used by the mayor or city council members to
communicate with the public. Such third party hosted services/tools may
include, but are not limited to: social networking sites (MySpace, Facebook,
LinkedIn), microblogging tools (Twitter, RSS feeds), audiovisual networking
sites (YouTube, Flickr), and blogs and similar sites.
   TAGGING: A mechanism of linking a person, page or place to a post.
   VISITOR: A person who views the mayor or city council member's social media
site.
   C.   Records Retention Act Compliance:
      1.   State and local records retention laws and schedules apply to social
media content. All social media content that is required to be retained shall
be maintained for the legally required retention period based on the subject
matter of the content. Prior approval of the retention format and procedures
for each social media tool being used must be received from the city
administrator upon the advice and recommendations of the public records officer
and city clerk. Except for social media sites/tools that are owned or
maintained by the city of Liberty Lake, which will be retained through the
city's archiving system, it is the ultimate responsibility of representatives
to maintain current, approved retention procedures and to ensure that those
procedures are followed.
      2.   As with any correspondence sent in his or her capacity, as
applicable, representatives' postings to social media sites maintained by
others must be retained by the representatives to the extent that such content
constitutes a "public record" as defined by chapter 42.56 Revised Code Of
Washington. Printouts of postings to others' sites may suffice for retention
purposes.
      3.   Representatives should consult with the city administrator or city
clerk for the applicable retention schedule and method.
   D.   Public Records Act Compliance:
      1.   Content maintained in a social media format that is related to city
business, including communication between individual representatives and
constituents or the general public, and a site's listing of "friends" or
"followers", may be considered a public record subject to disclosure under the
state public records act.
      2.   Any social media tools used should clearly state that all content
submitted by members of the public is potentially subject to public disclosure
pursuant to the public records act, Revised Code Of Washington 42.56. If it is
not possible to display this notice prominently on the site, representatives
should notify users by including a link from the site to the public records
act, notify new users via responses to posts, and/or periodically notify
existing users via broadcast message.
      3.   Under the state public records act, the city is potentially
responsible for responding accurately and completely to any public records
request, including a request for public records on social media maintained by
individual representatives. Therefore, it is mandatory that records have been
retained for the legally required retention period in accordance with
applicable standards.
      4.   Users of, and visitors to, social media sites shall be notified that
public disclosure requests must be directed to the appropriate city public
records officer pursuant to the city's public records disclosure policy.
   E.   Open Public Meetings Act And Appearance Of Fairness Doctrine
Compliance:
      1.   Communication between city council members via social media, as with
telephone and e-mail, may potentially constitute a "meeting" under the open
public meetings act, chapter 42.30 Revised Code Of Washington. For this reason,
city council members are prohibited from participating in social media
discussions/threads regarding city business that involve a quorum of city
council members, and are strongly discouraged from "friending" other city
council members or "liking" other city council members' posts.
      2.   In addition, receiving or making posts or comments regarding quasi-
judicial matters via social media may violate city council policy, local or
state law, including chapter 42.36 Revised Code Of Washington, appearance of
fairness doctrine. To avoid receiving any comments on pending quasi-judicial
matters that may violate the appearance of fairness doctrine, city council
members are strongly encouraged to maintain social media sites with settings
that can restrict users' ability to post content.
   F.   Equal Access:
      1.   Representatives are discouraged, in their official capacity, from
posting or commenting on social media sites that require membership or
subscription. When posting information or soliciting feedback on such a site,
representatives should always provide an alternate source for the same
information or mechanism for feedback on the city's public website so that
those that are not members of the social media site may have equal access.
(Ord. 234, 12-20-2016)
1-10-5: DISCLOSURE:
Disclosure as required by this chapter shall be in writing and filed with the
city clerk. Disclosure shall be made as soon as the person becomes aware of the
facts giving rise to the disclosure requirements. An oral disclosure made at a
regular or special city council meeting shall constitute compliance with this
section. The oral disclosure shall be included in the official minutes of the
council meeting. (Ord. 234, 12-20-2016)
1-10-6: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   Any member of a city board or commission found guilty of a violation of
this chapter may be suspended or removed from office by action of the city
council through a majority vote of the city council members.
   B.   Any member of the city council found guilty of a violation of this
chapter in addition to any other penalties permitted by law may: 1) receive a
written reprimand in a letter approved by the majority vote of the other city
council members, 2) a censure by written statement approved by majority vote of
the other city council members and administered personally to the individual
council member in open session of the city council, 3) suspension, or 4)
removal from office for repeated violations as determined and approved by a
majority vote of the other city council members.
   C.   In addition to the sanctions for aiding, abetting, seeking or
requesting a violation of this chapter, any person or organization which
wilfully attempts to secure preferential treatment in its dealing with the city
by offering any valuable gifts, whether in the form of services, loan, thing or
promise, or any other form to any city official or employee, shall have its
current contract with the city canceled and shall not be able to bid on any
other city contracts for a period of two (2) years. (Ord. 234, 12-20-2016)
1-10-7: RESPONSIBILITIES OF HEARING EXAMINER:
   A.   There is hereby delegated to the hearing examiner the responsibilities
set forth in sections
1-10-4 and
1-10-8 of this chapter relating to enforcement procedures of this code of
ethics. Once an allegation or complaint has been filed with the office of the
city clerk and notice of such filing has been transmitted to the hearing
examiner, which notice shall not set forth any names or details concerning the
complaint, the hearing examiner shall conduct an investigation; provided, that
in the event a complaint shall involve in some manner the office of the hearing
examiner, the matter shall be referred to the city attorney for investigation,
all in accordance with the procedures outlined herein.
   B.   The hearing examiner is also authorized to issue advisory opinions upon
request of city officials concerning the applicability of this chapter to
specific factual situations. Administrative employees under the supervision of
the mayor concerned with the applicability of this chapter to specific factual
situations may address their concerns to the mayor or his/her designee. (Ord.
234, 12-20-2016)
1-10-8: ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES:
   A.   Any person who has knowledge of a violation of this code of ethics by a
person other than an administrative employee under the supervision of the mayor
may make a signed written report of the same to the city clerk. The fact that a
report has been received, the contents of the report, and the identity of the
person making the report shall remain confidential until such time as the
hearing examiner has made an initial threshold determination that probable
cause exists to believe that a violation of the code of ethics has occurred.
   B.   Upon receipt of a report, the hearing examiner, without benefit of
subpoenas or sworn testimony, shall make such preliminary investigation as he
or she deems appropriate to determine whether probable cause exists to believe
that a violation of the code of ethics has occurred. Once the preliminary
investigation is complete, the person accused shall be given the name(s) of the
accuser(s) and the allegations whether or not the hearing examiner finds
probable cause. If the hearing examiner is satisfied that probable cause does
exist, he or she may choose between two (2) courses of action as follows:
      1.   Refer the matter to the proper authorities for criminal prosecution;
provided, that upon a determination that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt
necessary for criminal conviction is not available, the proper authorities may
refer the matter back to the hearing examiner for proceedings consistent with
the civil burden of proof (e.g., a simple preponderance of the evidence); or
      2.   Retain the matter for his or her own formal investigation with a
view toward the ultimate disposition by the city council in the event it is
determined an actual violation has occurred.
   C.   If the hearing examiner should determine probable cause does not exist,
he or she shall communicate his or her decision in writing to the person who
made the initial report. The hearing examiner's determination of lack of
probable cause shall remain confidential, unless the person who made the
initial report chooses to make his or her complaint public. Should this latter
event occur, all of the hearing examiner's records, files, notes,
correspondence, and investigative materials relating to the finding of lack of
probable cause shall be made open for public inspection.
   D.   Should the hearing examiner decide to retain the matter for his or her
own formal investigation pursuant to subsection B2 of this section, the hearing
examiner shall notify, in writing, the person who made the report and the
person complained against, of his or her decision to pursue a formal
investigation by way of holding a hearing to determine if a violation has
occurred. The person complained against may choose whether the hearing shall be
open or closed to the public.
   E.   Hearings conducted by the hearing examiner shall be informal. The
person complained against may be represented by legal counsel and may present

director shall proceed to determine and assess against such person the tax and
penalties provided for by this chapter and shall notify such taxpayer by mail

thereof from the date upon which the tax is due as provided by this chapter,
and, if said tax shall remain delinquent and unpaid for a period of thirty (30)
days from the date that the same was due and payable, the finance director
shall add a further penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax due.

attorney fees to the extent permitted by law. Amounts declared delinquent for
more than sixty (60) days by the finance director may be assigned to a third
party for collection in which case the amount of any collection charges shall
be in addition to all other amounts owed.

under this chapter quits business or otherwise disposes of his business, any
tax payable hereunder shall become immediately due and payable and such person
shall immediately make a return and pay the tax due, and, if such tax is not
paid by the person within ten (10) days from the date of such sale, exchange or
disposal, the purchaser or successor shall likewise thereupon become liable for
the payment of the full amount of such tax. (Ord. 108, 12-17-2002)

CRIMINAL CODE referred to herein as the "LLCC" or "chapter".
   B.   The sections of the Revised Code Of Washington now in effect or as
subsequently amended by the Washington legislature, specifically enumerated in
this chapter, are adopted by reference in this chapter.
   C.   In issuing a citation to any person or persons for violation of the
provisions of the LLCC, law enforcement officers may cite to either the
specific LLCC provision or the specific Revised Code Of Washington provision
from which it is adopted by reference. (Ord. 140, 10-4-2005)
6-1-2: PURPOSES; PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION:
   A.   The general purposes of the provisions governing the definition of
offenses are:1. To forbid and prevent conduct that inflicts or threatens
substantial harm to individual or public interests;2. To safeguard conduct that
is without culpability from condemnation as criminal;3. To give fair warning of
the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense; and4. To
differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses, and to
prescribe proportionate penalties for each.
   B.   The provisions of the LLCC shall be construed according to the fair
import of their terms, and when the language is susceptible of differing
constructions, it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated
herein.
   C.   In adopting the Washington state statutes by reference, only those
crimes and offenses within the jurisdiction of a municipality are intended to
be adopted and, in those sections adopted which define both misdemeanors and
felonies, only the language applicable to misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors
is to be applied.
   D.   Jurisdiction to prosecute any felonious activity remains with the state
of Washington, county of Spokane. (Ord. 140, 10-4-2005)

arrest, prosecution and punishment. (Ord. 140, 10-4-2005)
6-1-4: CLASSES OF CRIMES:
An offense defined by this chapter, for which a sentence of imprisonment is

classified as gross misdemeanors or misdemeanors. (Ord. 140, 10-4-2005)
6-1-5: PUNISHMENT AND RESTITUTION:
   A.   Unless specifically provided otherwise, every person convicted of a

such imprisonment and fine.
   B.   Unless specifically provided otherwise, every person convicted of a
misdemeanor shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term of not
more than ninety (90) days, or by a fine in an amount of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by both such imprisonment and fine.
   C.   Unless the court finds that the imposition of the minimum imprisonment
will pose a substantial risk to the defendant's physical or mental well being,
or that local jail facilities are in an overcrowded condition, the term of
imprisonment shall not be suspended or deferred. If a minimum term of
imprisonment is suspended or deferred, the court shall state in writing the
reason for granting the suspension or deferral and the facts upon which the
suspension or deferral is based. Unless the court finds the person to be
indigent, the minimum fine shall not be suspended or deferred.
   D.   The city council reserves the right to implement a community service
program to provide an alternative to fines and/or imprisonment in jail.
   E.   A court may impose restitution as provided in Revised Code of
Washington 9A.20.030.
   F.   In the event there is a conflict in the penalties that can be imposed

shall apply unless preempted by Washington state law. (Ord. 140, 10-4-2005)

not usually and publicly resident within the state of Washington.

equal to the length of time from the filing to the setting aside. (Ord. 140,

JUNK VEHICLES
SECTION:
6-3-1: Purpose And Intent
6-3-2: Outside Storage Restricted
6-3-3: Nuisance Abatement
6-3-4: Violation; Penalty
6-3-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The city recognizes the benefit and enjoyment individuals receive from the
repair and rehabilitation of old vehicles. It is, however, the purpose and
intent of this chapter to provide for the removal of junk vehicles that create
an attractive nuisance and negative aesthetic impact upon property and the
community. (Ord. 109, 1-4-2003)
6-3-2: OUTSIDE STORAGE RESTRICTED:
Except as otherwise permitted by city ordinance, no junk vehicles, as such term
is defined in RCW 46.55.010, shall be stored on any property within the city
for a period exceeding thirty (30) days, unless the same is stored on private
property within an enclosed structure or is covered by a vehicle cover intended
for such purpose. A junk vehicle does not include a motor vehicle which is in
the process of being repaired as evidenced by the good faith efforts of the
vehicle owner. Evidence relating to the good faith repair of a vehicle can be
established by producing invoices showing work or parts purchased for repair or
renovation of the vehicle, a declaration under penalty of perjury that the
vehicle is in the process of being repaired and has been worked on during the
past thirty (30) days or by providing such other reasonable information and
evidence to comply with the intent of this chapter. It shall be a defense to
abatement to move the junk vehicle into an enclosed structure (a building which
has 3 sides, a door and a roof lawfully constructed on the property or to
maintain a vehicle cover as set forth above). The owner of the real property
where the vehicle is stored shall be responsible for a violation of this
section.
A violation of this section shall be considered a public nuisance by storage of
a junk vehicle. The nuisance may be abated with the cost of abatement assessed
against the property owner and the registered owner of the vehicle, if the
identity of the owner can be determined, unless the owner when transferring
ownership of the vehicle has complied with RCW 46.12.101. (Ord. 109, 1-4-2003)
6-3-3: NUISANCE ABATEMENT:
   A.   Junk Vehicle Abatement:
      1.   Upon a determination by the city that a vehicle constitutes a public
nuisance or junk vehicle pursuant to section
6-3-2 of this chapter, the city shall issue a notice to the last registered
vehicle owner of record and the property owner of record that a violation of
city ordinance has occurred and an abatement will be commenced. The notice
shall provide that a hearing may be requested but if no such hearing is
requested, the vehicle will be promptly removed.
      2.   The property and vehicle owner shall be given fourteen (14) days
from the date the notice is mailed to request a hearing. Upon receipt of such a
request, the city shall provide a notice stating the time, location and date of
the hearing on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle, or part
thereof, as a public nuisance. The city shall mail this notice, by certified
mail, with five (5) day return receipt requested, to the owner of land as shown
on the last equalized assessment role and to the last registered and legal
vehicle owner of record unless the vehicle is in such a condition that
identification numbers are not visible.
      3.   The notice shall contain a statement that the owner of land on which
the vehicle is located may appear in person at a hearing conducted by the chief
of police or present a written statement for consideration. The owner may deny
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle and state the reasons for such
denial. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
property without consent of the property owner, and that there has been no
acquiescence by the property owner, then the city shall not assess costs of
administration or nuisance abatement against the property where the vehicle was
located.
      4.   Following notice by the city and a hearing, the vehicle shall be
removed under the order of the chief of police with notice provided to the
Washington state patrol and the department of licensing that the vehicle has
been wrecked. Upon removal, the city may dispose of the vehicle or parts as
scrap upon terms which are reasonable and just.
   B.   Cost Of Abatement: The city's reasonable cost for abatement, except as
described above, shall become a charge against the vehicle owner and property
owner and shall be recovered by the city. (Ord. 109, 1-4-2003)
6-3-4: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
Upon a finding that a violation of this chapter has occurred, the city may
recover the costs to remove the vehicle and the person in charge of such
vehicle shall be fined as provided in subsection 1-4-1B of this code per day
following notice of the violation. (Ord. 109, 1-4-2003; amd. 2004 Code)

6-4-4: Permit Requirements
6-4-5: Sale And Use Of Consumer Fireworks
6-4-6: Seizure Of Fireworks
6-4-7: Violation; Penalty
6-4-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to:
      1.   Establish a permitting process regulating, within the city, the
manufacturing, importing, possessing or selling any fireworks at wholesale;
making a public display of fireworks; transporting fireworks (except as a
public carrier delivering to a licensee); establishing or maintaining a place
where fireworks are manufactured, constructed, produced, packaged, stored,
sold, exchanged, discharged or used; and
      2.   Prohibit the sale or discharge, within the city, of any consumer
fireworks.
   B.   Pursuant to the provisions of RCW 70.77.395:
      1.   It is legal to sell and purchase consumer fireworks within this
state during the following days and hours:
 
June 28                         12:00 noon to 11:00 P.M.
June 29 through July 4          9:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M.
July 5                          9:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M.
December 27 through December 31 12:00 noon to 11:00 P.M. and as provided in RCW
                                70.77.311; and
 
      2.   Consumer fireworks may be used or discharged each day between the
following days and hours:
 
June 28                  12:00 noon to 11:00 P.M.

July 4                   9:00 A.M. to 12:00 midnight
July 5                   9:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M.
December 31 to January 1 6:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M. on January 1 of the subsequent
                         year and as provided in RCW 70.77.311.
 
   C.   In the case of Brown v. Yakima, 116 Wn.2d 556, 807 P.2d 353 (1991), the
Washington state supreme court held that the Washington state legislature did
not intend to preempt the entire field of fireworks regulations by enacting RCW
chapter 70.77. The court further held that an ordinance adopted by the city of
Yakima further restricting the dates and times as set forth in RCW 70.77.395
during which common fireworks (now identified as consumer fireworks under SSSB
6080, laws of 2002) may be sold or discharged within its jurisdiction was
constitutional and did not violate article XI subsection 11 of the Washington
state constitution.
   D.   The city now desires to exercise its rights as provided in article XI
subsection 11 of the Washington state constitution, RCW 35A.11.020 and RCW
70.77.250(4) to: 1) regulate, within the city, the manufacturing, importing,
possessing or selling any fireworks at wholesale; making a public display of
fireworks; transporting fireworks (except as a public carrier delivering to a
licensee); establishing or maintaining a place where fireworks are
manufactured, constructed, produced, packaged, stored, sold, exchanged,
discharged or used; and 2) prohibit the sale or discharge within the city of
any consumer fireworks. In exercising this right, the city would be prohibiting
the sale or discharge of consumer fireworks, as presently authorized in RCW
70.77.395, and as amended pursuant to SSSB 6080, laws of 2002. (Ord. 95, 8-6-

6-7-5: Commencement Of Action; Enforcement
6-7-6: Summary Closure
6-7-7: Severability
6-7-1: PURPOSE:
Chronic nuisance properties present grave health, safety and welfare concerns,
which the property owners or persons in charge of such properties have failed
to take corrective action to abate the nuisance condition. Chronic nuisance
properties have a tremendous negative impact upon the quality of life, safety
and health of the neighborhoods where they are located. This chapter is enacted
to remedy nuisance activities that repeatedly occur or exist at chronic
nuisance properties by providing a process for abatement; and this remedy is
not an exclusive remedy available under any state or local laws and may be used
in conjunction with such other laws.
Also, chronic nuisance properties are a financial burden to the city by the
repeated calls for service to the properties because of the nuisance activities
that repeatedly occur or exist on such property, and this chapter is a means to
ameliorate those conditions and hold responsible the owners or persons in
charge of such property. (Ord. 224, 10-6-2015)

activities occur or exist during any sixty (60) day period.

property, or conduct that occurs on a property.

imitation controlled substances as defined in chapter 69.52 Revised Code Of
Washington.

6-7-3: VIOLATION:
   A.   Any property within the city which is a chronic nuisance property is in
violation of this chapter and subject to its remedies; and
   B.   Any person in charge who permits property to be a chronic nuisance
property shall be in violation of this chapter and subject to its remedies.
(Ord. 224, 10-6-2015)
6-7-4: PROCEDURE:
   A.   When the chief of police, or his designee, receives police
documentation confirming the occurrence of three (3) or more nuisance
activities within a sixty (60) day period on the property, the chief of police,
or his designee, may review such reports to determine whether they describe the
nuisance activities enumerated in section
6-7-2 of this chapter. Upon such a finding, the chief of police, or his
designee, shall notify a property owner at the address shown on the county
auditor records, and shall notify the person in charge of the property in
writing that the property is in danger of being declared a chronic nuisance
property.
   B.   The notice shall contain:
      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
      2.   A concise description of the nuisance activities that exist, or that
have occurred on the property;
      3.   A demand that the owner or person in charge respond to the chief of
police, or his designee, within ten (10) days of service of the notice to
discuss the nuisance activities and create a plan to abate the chronic
nuisance;
      4.   Offer the person in charge an opportunity to abate the nuisance
activities giving rise to the violation; and
      5.   A statement describing that if legal action is sought, the property
could be subject to closure, civil penalties and/or costs assessed up to one
hundred dollars ($100.00) per day after the notice of the chronic nuisance
property is received.
   C.   Such notice shall be either: 1) personally served, or 2) delivered by
first class mail to the person in charge of the property with a copy mailed to
the owner at the address indicated by the Spokane County auditor, if different
than the person in charge of the property.
   D.   If the person in charge fails to respond to the notice within the time
prescribed, the chief of police, or his designee shall post such notice at the
property and issue the person in charge a class 1 civil infraction. If the
person in charge fails to respond to the issue infraction the matter shall be
referred to the city attorney for further action.
   E.   If the person in charge responds as required by the notice and agrees
to abate the nuisance activity, the chief of police, or his designee, and the
person in charge and/or the property owner, may work out an agreed upon course
of action which would abate the nuisance activity. If an agreed course of
action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activities or if no
agreement concerning abatement is reached, the matter shall be forwarded to the
city attorney for enforcement action.
   F.   It is a defense to an action for chronic nuisance property that the
person in charge at all material times could not, in the exercise of reasonable
care or diligence, determine that the property had become chronic nuisance
property, or could not in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and
diligence, control the conduct leading to the determination that the property
is a chronic nuisance property. (Ord. 224, 10-6-2015)
6-7-5: COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION; ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Once the matter is referred to the city attorney, the city attorney
shall immediately review and make a determination to initiate legal action
authorized under this chapter or state statute, or may seek alternative forms
of abatement of the nuisance activity. The city attorney may initiate legal
action on the chronic nuisance property and seek civil penalties and costs in
superior court for the abatement of the nuisance.
   B.   In determining whether a property shall be deemed a chronic nuisance
property and subject to the court's jurisdiction, the city shall have the
initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the
property is a chronic nuisance property. The city may submit official police
reports and other affidavits outlining the information that led to arrest(s),
if applicable, and other chronic nuisance activity occurring or existing at the
property. The failure to prosecute an individual, or the fact no one has been
convicted of a crime is not a defense to a chronic nuisance action.
   C.   Once a superior court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance
under this chapter the court may impose a civil penalty against any or all of
the persons in charge of the property and/or the owner of the property, and may
order any other relief deemed appropriate. A civil penalty may be assessed for
up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day the nuisance activity
continues to occur following the date of the original notice by the chief of
police, or his designee, as described in section
6-7-4 of this chapter. In assessing the civil penalty, the court may consider
the following factors, citing to those found applicable:
      1.   The actions taken by the person in charge and/or owner to mitigate
or correct the nuisance activity;
      2.   The financial condition of the persons in charge;
      3.   The repeated or continuous nature of the nuisance activity;
      4.   The statements of the neighbors or those affected by the nuisance
activity; and
      5.   Any other factor deemed relevant by the court.
   D.   The superior court which determined the property to be a chronic
nuisance property shall also assess costs against the person in charge and/or
owner in the amount it costs the city to abate, or attempt to abate, the
nuisance activity.
   E.   If the superior court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance
property, the superior court shall order the property closed and secured
against all unauthorized access, use and occupancy for a period up to one year,
and may impose a civil penalty and costs.
   F.   Once a determination has been made by the superior court that the
chronic nuisance property shall be subject to closure, the court may authorize
the city to physically secure the premises and initiate such closure. Costs for
such closure shall be submitted to the court for review. Any civil penalty and/
or costs awarded to the city may be filed with the city treasurer who shall
cause the same to be filed as a lien on the property with the county treasurer.
The city shall file a formal lis pendens notice when an action for abatement is
filed in the superior court.
   G.   The superior court shall retain jurisdiction during any period of
closure or abatement of the property.
   H.   Spokane district court is to have jurisdiction of all civil infractions
issued pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 224, 10-6-2015)
6-7-6: SUMMARY CLOSURE:
Nothing in this chapter prohibits the city from taking any emergency action for
the summary closure of such property when it is necessary to avoid an immediate
threat to public welfare and safety. The city may take summary action to close
the property without complying with the notification provisions of section
6-7-4 of this chapter, but shall provide such notice as is reasonable under the
circumstances. (Ord. 224, 10-6-2015)
6-7-7: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter, or its application
to any person or circumstances, shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality
shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section,
sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter, or its application to any person or
circumstances. (Ord. 224, 10-6-2015)

stated herein shall apply only when the procedures outlined in subsection A of
this section have been followed. (Ord. 110, 2-4-2003)
7-2-5: IMPOUNDMENT PROCEDURES:
Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize seizure of a vehicle
without a warrant where a warrant would otherwise be required by law.

vehicle is arrested for a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504, or of
46.20.342 or 46.20.420, or the equivalent provisions of this title, the vehicle
is subject to impoundment, pursuant to the applicable ordinance or state law at
the direction of a city police officer. In addition, a police officer may take
custody of a vehicle and provide for its prompt removal to a place of safety
under any of the following circumstances:
      1.   Whenever a police officer finds a vehicle standing upon the roadway
in violation of any of the provisions of RCW 46.61.560, or the equivalent
provisions of this title, the officer may provide for the removal of the
vehicle or require the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move
the vehicle to a position off the roadway;
      2.   Whenever a police officer finds a vehicle unattended upon a highway
where the vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic or jeopardizes public
safety;
      3.   Whenever a police officer finds an unattended vehicle at the scene
of an accident or when the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident is
physically or mentally incapable of deciding upon steps to be taken to protect
his property;
      4.   Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested and taken into custody
by a police officer;
      5.   Whenever a police officer discovers a vehicle that the officer
determines to be a stolen vehicle;
      6.   Whenever a vehicle without a special license plate, card or decal
indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport a disabled person under
RCW 46.16.381 is parked in a stall or space clearly and conspicuously marked
under RCW 46.61.581 which space is provided on private property without charge
or on public property;
      7.   Upon determining that a person is operating a motor vehicle without
a valid driver's license in violation of RCW 46.20.005, or the equivalent
provisions of this title, or with a license that has been expired for ninety
(90) days or more;
      8.   Whenever any police officer finds a vehicle or device parked, angle
parked, or so used as to endanger any user or potential user of any public
street or way open to the public;
      9.   Whenever any police officer finds a vehicle stalled, disabled,
unattended or unable to move under its own power on or in any public facility,
including streets, roads or highways, tunnels, bridges or approaches thereto in
the city, and such an occurrence is or may be a menace or obstruction to the
safety of the general public;
      10.   Whenever any police officer finds a vehicle operating upon the
streets and highways of this city which is defective in equipment in such a
manner that it is unsafe. Said vehicle shall be an unlawful vehicle and may be
prevented from further operation until the equipment defect is corrected and it
satisfactorily passes inspection as directed by the chief of police or his

operation of any such defective vehicle to a place for correction of the
equipment defect in the manner directed by any peace officer or representative
of the state commission on equipment;

order of the police chief parking is limited to designated classes of vehicles
or is prohibited during certain hours, or designated days, or at all times, and
where such vehicle is interfering with the proper and intended use of such
zones. With respect to any of the above grounds for impoundment, if in the
discretion of a police officer, a delay in the impoundment and removal of the
vehicle would not unduly inconvenience or endanger the public safety and
health, he may make or cause to be made efforts of notification of an
identifiable owner. Such efforts of notification may include canvassing the
area, telephone calls or application of a twenty four (24) hour notification
sticker referenced in this section;
      13.   When the vehicle poses an immediate danger to public safety; or

reasons:
         a.   When such vehicle is parked in violation of any law, ordinance or
regulation; or
         b.   When such vehicle is so mechanically defective as to be unsafe
for operation; provided, however, that this section shall not be construed to

officer shall check the records to learn the identity of the last owner of
record. The officer shall make a reasonable effort to contact the owner by
telephone in order to give the owner the information on the twenty four (24)
hour notification tag. If the vehicle is not removed within twenty four (24)
hours from the time the notification tag is attached, the law enforcement
officer may take custody of the vehicle and provide for the vehicle's removal
to a place of safety. A vehicle that does not pose a traffic hazard may remain
on the roadside for more than twenty four (24) hours if the owner or operator
is unable to remove it from the place where it is located and so notified law
enforcement officials and requests assistance.
      3.   The notification placed on the vehicle shall contain the following
information:
         a.   The date and time the notice was attached;

and declares that by reason of climatic and other conditions, city streets are
seriously damaged and often destroyed by the continuous movement and operation
of heavy trucks and other vehicles. By restricting or limiting the permissible
weight of a vehicle traveling on a city street, the city will protect the
public's investment and reduce potential public health and safety problems. The
frequent operation of heavy vehicles on city streets decreases the anticipated
life of the street, decreases property values and increases the cost to
maintain, repair and improve city streets. (Ord. 160, 3-20-2007)

restriction is necessary to prevent serious damage or destruction to the
bridge. (Ord. 160, 3-20-2007)

maintenance season shall run from March through October, as weather permits.
All work involving power equipment shall occur only between the hours of seven
o'clock (7:00) A.M. and eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. on weekdays. Mowing should be
performed during nonpeak usage times.
   A.   Turf: Mow and edge lawn areas approximately one time per week, or as
needed to maintain an even, well groomed appearance.
      1.   Turf areas used as athletic fields should be maintained at one inch
(1") to one and one-half inches (11/2") in height, but height shall never
exceed five inches (5").
      2.   All other turf areas should be maintained at least one and one-half
inches (11/2") to two inches (2") in height, but height shall never exceed five
inches (5").
      3.   Visible lawn clippings shall be removed and disposed of off site.
The use of mulching mowers which cut clippings into small pieces that sift down
into the lawn shall be encouraged.
      4.   All turf around posts, fences, trees, valve boxes, etc., shall be
maintained by mechanical or where necessary, by preemergent/postemergent
methods. All turf areas shall be edged at sidewalks, curbs, and landscape beds.
      5.   Turf areas shall be kept in a healthy, vigorous condition, free of
disease and pests. Weeds shall be controlled in lawn areas as noted in
subsection C of this section. Fertilizer shall be applied as provided in
subsection E of this section.
   B.   Trees, Shrubs, Vines And Ground Cover Beds: Maintain as needed to
provide for an overall neat appearance, based on the following standards:
      1.   Trees:
         a.   Trees shall be maintained in a healthy, vigorous growing
condition, free from disease and pests.
         b.   Trees should be pruned only to remove dead, diseased, broken,
dangerous or crossing branches, and as required in this subsection.
         c.   Trees should be pruned only in appropriate months as determined
by an arborist. Pruning shall be in accordance with generally accepted
standards for proper pruning.
         d.   All cuts shall be painted immediately with a black, asphalt-base
antiseptic tree paint ("tree heal" or equal).
         e.   All tree trimmings shall be discarded off site using a legal
method.
         f.   Tree stakes should be removed from trees when the trunks are
larger than two inches (2") in caliper and the trees are able to support
themselves. Stakes shall be removed from site and disposed of by a legal method
or recycled.
         g.   All deciduous trees shall be pruned once a year to encourage a
high branching structure. All nonstructural branches shall be removed between
the ground and a point half the tree's total height, not to exceed twenty feet
(20'). Exception: trees planted for screening purposes, such as those at rear
perimeters of many sites shall not be pruned except as needed to remove dead,
diseased, broken, dangerous or crossing branches.
         h.   The cutting blades on pruning shears, clippers, blades, saws,
etc., shall be sterilized after pruning each tree to minimize the possibility
of spreading disease. When pruning trees known or suspected to be diseased,
cutting blades shall be sterilized after each cut.
An acceptable method for sterilizing blades is dipping them in a solution of
one part bleach and nine (9) parts water or heavily spraying them with a
disinfectant spray, such as Lysol. After dipping or spraying, wait twenty (20)
seconds before using again.
         i.   A vertical clearance of fourteen feet (14') shall be required
above all parking spaces. A vertical clearance of eight feet (8') shall be
required above all walkways. Trees shall be trimmed to remove all limbs within
these areas.
         j.   Trees shall have a base well free of weeds and other vegetation
that would prohibit water from reaching the root system.
      2.   Shrubs And Vines:
         a.   Shrubs and vines shall be kept in a healthy, vigorous condition,
free from disease and pests.
         b.   Shrubs shall be pruned as needed to remove branches that are
dead, broken, extending beyond the face of curbs or sidewalks or are climbing
building walls (unless they are intended to climb the wall, such as climbing
vines). Formal hedges and topiary shall be regularly pruned to maintain a
uniform height and width. Except as previously noted, shrubs should be allowed
to grow unpruned to their natural sizes.
         c.   Shrubs uniformly planted in rows, where it is clear the intent
was to create a hedge, shall be pruned so as to encourage a hedge. Shrubs in
hedges shall be encouraged through pruning to form a dense, continuous, hedge,
branching fully to the ground. All other shrubs shall be pruned only as
required for safety, visibility and plant health, and allowed to develop into
the natural shapes expected of the plant variety.
         d.   Shrubs shall be allowed three (3) months to rejuvenate following
a hard frost prior to pruning or replacing.
         e.   The cutting blades on pruning shears, clippers, blades, saws,
etc., shall be sterilized between every three (3) shrubs to minimize the
possibility of spreading disease. When pruning shrubs known or suspected to be
diseased, the cutting blades shall be sterilized after each cut. An acceptable
method for sterilizing blades is dipping them in a solution of one part bleach
and nine (9) parts water or heavily spraying them with a disinfectant spray,
such as Lysol. After dipping or spraying, wait twenty (20) seconds before using
again.
      3.   Ground Cover:
         a.   Ground cover shall be maintained in a healthy, vigorous growing
condition.
         b.   Ground cover shall be trimmed back from sidewalks, curbs and
paved areas on a weekly basis or as needed. The edges shall be cut at an angle
for a more natural appearance and healthier plants.
      4.   Mulch/Rock Layer:
         a.   Soil mulch and/or rock layer shall be cared for as needed to
create and maintain an even and uniform appearance over the visible soil
surface of each planter area.
         b.   A layer no less than two inches (2") deep at all times shall be
maintained in shrub planters. Mulch and/or decorative rock shall not be
required in areas where plant foliage completely covers the soil surface, such
that the soil is not visible through the foliage.
         c.   Any mulch or decorative rock found outside planter areas shall be
returned to the planter on a weekly basis.
         d.   Mulch and/or decorative rock shall be uniform in color and
appearance, and free of leaves, sticks or trash. Mulch may be chipped or
shredded wood, bark or decorative rock. When replacing existing mulch, the
mulch product shall be similar in appearance to that already at the site.
Replacement rock shall be the same size and color as existing decorative rock
on site. In the event no rock is existing, the decorative rock used shall have
a maximum diameter of three-fourths inch (3/4") and a minimum diameter of
three-eighths inch (3/8").
   C.   Weed Control: Weeds in planted areas, sidewalks, curbs, gutters or
pavement shall be removed or killed weekly as the weeds emerge. Weeds shall be
removed (not just killed) if they are larger than two inches (2") in height or
diameter. Disposal of weeds shall be off site. Preemergent and postemergent
herbicides may be used if necessary to maintain appearance. Regular maintenance
of the mulch or decorative rock layer shall be encouraged to help minimize
weeds in shrub and ground cover areas.
   D.   Chemicals, Herbicides, Pesticides:
      1.   All chemicals shall be used in accordance with label directions and
the manufacturer's recommended handling methods. All chemicals shall be handled
in accordance with all applicable regulations. Registered chemicals shall be
used only on the advice of a qualified, licensed, pest control advisor. Nothing
in this specification shall be construed to be the advice of, or to substitute
for the advice of, a pest control adviser.
      2.   Pesticides shall not be applied within one hour of the start of
operating hours for the site. In the event that it is not possible to complete
the application by one hour prior to normal operating hours (i.e., 24 hour
operations), applications shall be made at times when customer presence is
minimal. Areas to be treated shall be blocked off and warning signs posted.
      3.   Precautions shall be taken to keep persons away from pesticide and
herbicide treated areas until the applied material is fully dry and the treated
area is safe for entry. The recommendations of the pesticide manufacturer, and
all applicable governmental and industry regulations, shall be followed.
   E.   Fertilizer:
      1.   Fertilizer shall be applied in a manner consistent with best
management practices at a rate specified by manufacturer for specific
application.
      2.   Fertilizing should be done, at least, twice a year (spring and
fall).
      3.   Foliar applied fertilizer shall be water soluble and non- burning.
Formulation shall have a minimum phosphorous content. Apply at manufacturer's
maximum recommended concentration for plant type. Granular fertilizer shall be
applied at maximum label rate for plant type at a forty (40) day interval.
Water shall be applied immediately after fertilizer application to move the
fertilizer into the soil and wash the fertilizer off of plant surfaces.
      4.   Granular fertilizers shall be applied to drip irrigated areas only
in early spring, just prior to a moderate rainfall. The fertilizer must be
washed in by hand or rainfall before turning on the drip system. Running the
drip system immediately after application will push the fertilizer away from
the emitters and cause high concentration at the edge of the wetted area which
can damage plants.
      5.   Fertilizers used in parks located within the Liberty Lake watershed
shall be phosphate free or a formula accepted by the Liberty Lake sewer and
water district.
   F.   Cleaning And Litter Removal:
      1.   Walks, curbs, parking areas and gutters shall be swept or blown off
weekly and all trash, litter and debris shall be collected and disposed of.
      2.   Trash, leaves, clippings or landscape debris shall not be blown or
swept into planters or onto adjacent property. All debris swept or blown from
landscape areas should be collected and removed from the site.
      3.   Blowers shall not be used around parked vehicles in order to avoid
scratching vehicle paint with blowing sand and debris. All litter shall be
removed from sidewalks, gutters and all planted areas each week. In no case
shall trash, litter or leaves be blown or swept onto the property of others.
All trash, litter, leaves, etc., shall be collected, hauled away and disposed
of legally.
   G.   Irrigation:
      1.   Water Application And Scheduling:
         a.   Irrigation shall be made by the use of permanent irrigation
systems. Hand water as needed to supplement the permanent system.
         b.   The irrigation system should be examined for damage or
malfunction weekly.
         c.   Watering times should be adjusted each week to provide adequate
water to vegetation; however, the use of water conservation shall be
encouraged. Multiple start times and short run times shall be used to prevent
runoff and over watering. Drip systems should be left on for sufficient time to
allow for saturation of the root zone and multiple start times should be
avoided.
         d.   All turf and plant materials shall be maintained in a healthy
condition and hand watering should be used temporarily when necessary due to a
system malfunction.
      2.   Irrigation System Scheduled Maintenance:
         a.   Each valve zone shall be observed for signs of damage and proper
operation on a weekly basis during the irrigation season.
         b.   Cleaning and flushing of the system shall be performed yearly or
more often as needed.
         c.   The use of a certified backflow prevention device is required on
all irrigation systems.
         d.   Drip systems shall be flushed at least once a year and allowed to
run for at least fifteen (15) minutes with the ends open at full flow to flush.
Runoff of water from irrigation systems into or onto streets, sidewalks, stairs
or gutters is not permitted. The system shall immediately be shut down and
adjustments, repairs or replacements made as soon as possible to correct the
source of the runoff. (Ord. 90, 5-21-2002)
8-1B-3: DAMAGE, HAZARDS AND SAFETY:
Any turf or plant material found to be dead or missing shall be replaced
immediately with a healthy plant material of identical species and equivalent
size, unless otherwise permitted. Anything on the site that is found to be
hazardous shall be corrected or removed immediately. At no time shall work be
performed or materials installed in any location or manner which may endanger
the health, safety or welfare of the public now or in the future. Anyone
performing work in parks or open spaces shall comply with all rules,
ordinances, regulations, etc., as set forth by the city.
   A.   Replacement trees, shrubs, vines and ground covers shall be properly
installed, including staking if applicable, and fertilized upon installation.
   B.   If irregular foot traffic through a planter is preventing a ground
cover from reaching full coverage of the soil, the foot traffic should be
reduced through the installation of pavers, stepping stones, a concrete walk, a
gravel path and/or barriers to redirect the pedestrians.
   C.   Any lawn found to be dead or severely yellowed shall be replaced with
plant material of identical species. Replacement sod shall be similar in all
respects to the existing grass. Seed shall not be used unless otherwise
specified.
   D.   Any replacement of irrigation system components shall be made with
materials of the same manufacturer and model as the original equipment.
Substitutions of materials other than original equipment will be approved only
when the original equipment has been discontinued and is no longer available
for purchase at any location. The substituted equipment shall be completely
compatible with the original. All repairs to the system shall be identical to
the original installation, unless otherwise specified. Changes to the
installation which will result in lower future maintenance costs, less frequent
breakage or an increase in public safety, shall be encouraged.
Sprinklers on risers above the ground level shall not be installed, even if the
risers are flexible. Spring operated, popup style sprinkler heads shall be
used.
      1.   The entire irrigation system shall be checked weekly for items such
as dry spots/over watering and missing or malfunctioning irrigation components,
such as leaking valves, water running across sidewalks, water standing in
puddles, excessive watering or any other condition which hampers the correct
operation of the system or the public safety. Plant materials shall be observed
for signs of wilting, indicating a lack of water and the irrigation system
shall be adjusted as necessary.
      2.   Plastic sprinkler nozzles with bad patterns shall be replaced with
new nozzles of the same gallonage and arc as part of the regular maintenance of
the sprinkler system, only brass nozzles may be carefully cleaned if needed.
(Ord. 90, 5-21-2002)
8-1B-4: CHECKLISTS:
   A.   A weekly landscape maintenance checklist shall be made available by the
planning and community development department to anyone performing regular
maintenance work in public parks. This checklist shall be reviewed weekly and
all applicable items on the list shall be completed weekly.
   B.   A monthly maintenance checklist shall be made available by the planning
and community development department to anyone performing regular maintenance
work in city parks and open space areas. This checklist shall be reviewed
monthly and all the applicable items listed for the current month shall be
completed prior to the end of the month. (Ord. 90, 5-21-2002)
8-1B-5: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Administration: The planning and community development department shall
be responsible for the administration of this article.
   B.   Enforcement: For public parks not owned by the city, failure to adhere
to standards after written warning will result in the necessary maintenance
being completed and the property owner billed the cost of work performed.
   C.   Variances: To promote the sound interpretation and application of the
standards set forth in this chapter, a variance or deviation from any
applicable standard may be sought through the planning and community
development director. A variance request shall identify the property subject to
this chapter, the owner or agent in charge of maintaining the property and a
statement setting forth the variance or deviation from the minimum maintenance
standards set forth in section
8-1B-2 of this article. Standards for exercising discretion in the grant of a
variance or deviation from the maintenance standards shall include, but not be
limited to, a determination that special circumstances, practical difficulties
or other conditions exist which make it impractical or unreasonable to comply
with the maintenance standards. The director of planning and community
development may request information in order to aid or support the
determination of a variance or deviation. The director shall exercise best
efforts in order to make the determination within two (2) business days of the
request. (Ord. 90, 5-21-2002)

It shall be the duty of the city clerk to maintain for public inspection a
list, map and related files of all streets and associated right of way within
the corporate limits of the city. (Ord. 78, 1-8-2002)
8-3-2: CONTROL OF STREETS:
The city shall have the sole right to: a) change or establish the grade of any
city street; b) determine the width, alignment and function for a city street;
and c) determine the amount of right of way necessary for a street including
regulating all uses therein. Upon acceptance of a city street (and expiration
of any applicable warranty, guarantee or bond) the city shall have the right to
maintain all curbs and street surfaces including cleaning, snow removal,
signing and providing traffic control devices and illumination. Streets may be
accepted by the city either through subdivision, plat or binding site plan
approval, dedication or other acceptance and certification by the city
engineer. The city shall have the right to regulate, permit and license all
reasonable uses with the public right of way. (Ord. 78, 1-8-2002)
8-3-3: STREET CLASSIFICATIONS:
City streets are most effectively classified by their function with respect to
the service they are intended to provide to the public. The primary function of
the street system is to provide mobility and access to and through the
community in a safe and efficient manner. The classification of streets creates
and defines the design, use, volume and capacity of the street. Classification
of the streets also assists in determining the amount of right of way, improved
surfaces and design geometry.  The following classifications are general
descriptions with more detailed information set forth in the American
Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) manual. The
classification of city streets is as follows:
   A.   Major Or Principal Arterials: Major arterials provide transportation
corridors for major traffic movements within the city serving major centers of
city activity interarea travel between the city and other urban or suburban
centers. Major arterials carry relatively high volumes of traffic as compared
with other streets within the city. Major arterials are designated for bus
routes and major commercial or industrial centers.
   B.   Secondary Or Minor Arterials: Secondary arterials interconnect and
support the major arterial system providing service to less intensive
development including the distribution of traffic to small geographic areas
other than those identified in the major arterial system. Secondary arterials
distribute traffic from the major arterials to the access streets.
   C.   Access Streets: Access streets provide movement and circulation to and
from residential neighborhoods away from the arterial street system. Access
streets should be designed for low volumes of traffic discouraging excessive
speeds. (Ord. 78, 1-8-2002)
8-3-4: DESIGN STANDARDS:
In the design of city streets, the city shall apply the uniform design
standards adopted by the state design standard committee as far as practicable
with no deviation from the design standards unless approval is received from
the state aid engineer. (Ord. 78, 1-8-2002)
8-3-5: HARVARD ROAD MITIGATION PLAN:
   A.   Plan Adopted: Pursuant to RCW 35.21.180, 35A.11.020 and 35A.21.160, the
city adopts by reference the Spokane County Harvard Road mitigation plan dated
December 1995, which is incorporated herein by this reference as presently
constituted or hereinafter amended as the interim Harvard Road mitigation plan
of the city. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Spokane
County shall be construed to mean the city of Liberty Lake and references to
county staff shall refer to the mayor or designee. The city clerk shall
maintain one copy on file of the Harvard Road mitigation plan adopted by this
section.
      1.   Adoption Of Other Laws: To the extent that any provision of the
Spokane County code, or any other law, rule or regulation referenced in the
adopted Harvard Road mitigation plan is necessary or convenient to establish
the validity, enforceability or interpretation of the Harvard Road mitigation
plan, then such provision of the Spokane County code, or other law, rule or
regulation is hereby adopted by reference.
      2.   Reference To Hearing Bodies: When the adopted Harvard Road
mitigation plan refers to planning commissions, board of appeals, hearing
examiner or any other similar body, the city council shall serve in all such
roles, but retains the right to establish any one or more of such bodies at any
time and without regard to whether any quasi-judicial or other matter is then
pending.
   B.   Liability: The express intent of the city is that the responsibility
for compliance with the provisions of this section shall rest with the permit
applicant and their agents. This section and its provisions are adopted with
the express intent to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general
public and are not intended to protect any particular class of individuals or
organizations. (Ord. 55, 8-21-2001)
8-3-6: SIDEWALK MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Purpose: The city declares it is in the best interests of the citizens
of the city to require the maintenance of sidewalks to keep the same free from
any obstruction, impediment or condition that impairs the safety or use of the
sidewalk.
   B.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply:
    ABUTTING PROPERTY: All property having frontage upon the sides or margins
of any street.
   SIDEWALK: Includes any and all pedestrian structures or forms of improvement
for pedestrians included in the space within the street margin, as defined by a
curb or the edge of the traveled road surface, and the line where the public
right of way meets the abutting property.
   STREET: A public or private roadway which provides the primary means of
access to property.
   C.   Duty To Maintain: When any street is improved with a sidewalk along
either or both sides thereof, the duty to clean and maintain the same shall be
upon the abutting property owner. It shall be the responsibility of the owner
of property abutting upon a public sidewalk to maintain the sidewalk at all
times in a safe condition, by removing snow and ice or any accumulation of
debris, materials or objects where the same endangers or interferes with the
public convenience in the use of such sidewalks. Maintenance shall include
repair and restoration of the sidewalk according to city standards.
   D.   Expense Of Maintenance And Repair: The burden and expense of
maintaining and repairing sidewalks along the side of any street shall be upon
the abutting property owner.
   E.   Penalty For Noncompliance: In addition to any other legal remedy, the
city may issue a class I civil infraction pursuant to the provisions of section
1-4-1 of this code to a property owner for failure to comply with the
provisions of this section.
   F.   Liability: The express intent of the city is that the responsibility
for compliance with the provisions of this section shall rest with the abutting
property owner. This section and its provisions are adopted for the purpose of
protecting the health, safety and welfare of the general public and not any
particular class of individuals or organizations. (Ord. 123, 12-3-2003)

extent of city participation. (Ord. 129, 7-20-2004)
8-3A-2: REQUIREMENT FOR STREET IMPROVEMENTS:
Prior to the city participating in a reimbursement agreement or establishing a
reimbursement area, the following must be satisfied:
   A.   The street improvement area must be identified through a city plan
(i.e., 6 year street program), identified as a requirement of development
pursuant to the development regulations of the city, be a condition of land use
development or be found to be in the best interests of the city.
   B.   A design plan and itemization of the cost of the improvement shall be
submitted to the city.
   C.   A map showing the location of the project in relation to the benefitted
parcels of property shall be submitted to the city.
   D.   A project cost estimate showing the proposed assessment for each
separate parcel of property within the reimbursement area including any
contributions from governmental entities.
   E.   A list of the property owners within the reimbursement area including

improvement. (Ord. 129, 7-20-2004)
8-3A-3: NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS:
If the reimbursement agreement (and accompanying ordinance) will impose an
assessment upon surrounding property owners, the city shall, through registered
mail, provide a notice to all record property owners within the assessment
reimbursement area stating the boundaries of the reimbursement area and the
proposed assessments. The notice shall indicate that upon completion of the
improvement the property owner will be required to pay a proportionate share of
the costs that relate to the benefit received from the constructed improvement.
The property owner shall be informed that there is a right to request a hearing
before the city council within twenty (20) days from the date of notice. The
purpose of the hearing shall be to determine the extent of reimbursement area
and whether the assessed amount is reasonable and appropriate. The
determination of the city council shall be final and binding. (Ord. 129, 7-20-
2004)
8-3A-4: CONTENTS OF REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS:
To memorialize city participation, a reimbursement agreement with the developer
(s) shall be executed which will include a legal description, a map and the
assessments within the reimbursement area. The agreement shall provide in part:
a) property owner assessments shall be based upon a prorata share of the costs
of design and construction; and b) payment of assessments will be due upon the
issuance of a city permit authorizing the property owner to construct a
building or improvement upon the subject property that benefits from the
improvement. The reimbursement agreement shall be approved by the city council.
Where the city is a participant in a reimbursement area, the city council
shall, by motion or resolution, authorize city participation in the
reimbursement area and may provide for the recovery of city expenditures from
benefitted property owners to the extent that the property owner receives
benefit from the construction of the improvement. The city shall be responsible
to fund that portion of the improvement that provides a general public benefit.
The reimbursement agreement shall be recorded by the city clerk with the county
auditor within thirty (30) days of its approval by the city council. The final
reimbursement contract filed with the county auditor shall be binding on all
property owners within the assessment area. Any contract for reimbursement from
a property owner may not exceed a term of fifteen (15) years. (Ord. 129, 7-20-

references to county staff shall refer to the mayor or designee. The city clerk
shall maintain one copy on file of the guidelines for stormwater management
adopted by this section.
      1.   Adoption Of Other Laws: To the extent that any provision of the
Spokane County code, or any other law, rule or regulation referenced in the
adopted guidelines for stormwater management is necessary or convenient to
establish the validity, enforceability or interpretation of the guidelines for

8-4-2: UTILITY ESTABLISHED:
The city hereby establishes a storm and surface water utility to provide for
the development, maintenance and control of storm drainage and surface water
within the city. The city reserves and elects to exercise all power and
authority relating to the construction, acquisition, condemnation, maintenance
and operation of the storm drainage and surface water systems including the
right to establish rates and charges for service.
Recognizing the purpose and functions of the Liberty Lake sewer and water
district, the mayor or designee may coordinate and jointly perform activities
with the Liberty Lake sewer and water district that promote the maintenance,
operation and development of the city storm and surface water drainage utility.
The mayor may adopt rules, policies and programs that relate to joint
activities between the city and sewer district including the review of
development proposals that affect storm or surface water control. (Ord. 88A, 4-
15-2003)
8-4-3: PURPOSE:
The storm and surface water utility is created to promote and protect the
public health, safety and welfare by establishing a comprehensive approach to
storm and surface water management recognizing that the utility will provide
benefits to the real property located within the city. Further, the utility
will assist in protecting the Liberty Lake natural environment by reducing the
likelihood of flooding and erosion by controlling the discharge of storm and
surface water into the ground. (Ord. 88A, 4-15-2003)

entry of water into the soil mantle as under natural conditions prior to
development, and/or a hard surface area which causes water to run off the
surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow different than
the natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces
include, but are not limited to, rooftops, walkways, patios, driveways, paved

applicant can meet the technical, financial and legal qualifications to meet
all of the terms and conditions of a franchise and that the applicant is a
competent operator of such systems. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-7: APPLICATION FEE:
   A.   Unless prohibited by applicable law, each application for new
franchise; the renewal of an existing franchise; any sale, assignment, merger,
transfer or change of control; or any request for modification of or any other

the reasonable expenses of the city that relate to review of the application or
renewal.
   B.   Unless prohibited by applicable law, where the city's actual costs in
considering the application exceed the application filing fee, such costs shall
be paid by the applicant. The city will bill for costs with payment due thirty
(30) calendar days from date of invoice. If invoices are not paid within the
thirty (30) days, the applicant shall be charged and shall pay interest at the
maximum rate per annum on the amount of the unpaid costs. The invoice will
provide the method of calculation, documentation and total amounts due less the
original credit of the application filing fee. The city will submit the final

denial of the franchise by the city council.
   C.   The time of city employees shall be charged at their respective rates
of pay, including overtime if applicable, plus benefits and a reasonable
overhead ("actual administrative expenses"). Any other costs will be billed
proportionately on an actual cost basis. All billings will be itemized to

city claims reimbursement. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-8: CONSIDERATION OF APPLICATIONS:
   A.   The city will consider each application for a new or renewed franchise
where the application is found to be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and any applicable request for proposals (RFP). In
evaluating an application the city will consider, among other things, the
applicant's past service and safety record in the city and in other
communities, the nature of the proposed facilities and services, proposed area
of service, proposed rates, and whether the proposal would adequately serve the
public needs and the overall interests of the citizens of the city.
   B.   If the city determines that an applicant's proposal for a new franchise
would serve the public interest, it may grant a franchise to the applicant,
subject to additional terms and conditions as agreed upon between the applicant
and the city. No franchise shall be deemed granted unless and until a franchise
agreement acceptable to the parties has been executed. Any such franchise must
be approved by ordinance of the city council.
   C.   Where the application is for a renewed franchise, the city shall
consider whether:
      1.   The applicant has substantially complied with the material terms of
the existing franchise and with applicable law;
      2.   The applicant's use or occupation of the right of way presents an
unreasonable or unacceptable risk to public health, safety or welfare and
whether the applicant's construction, installation, operation or maintenance
practices have been conducted in an unsafe or dangerous manner;
      3.   The applicant has the ability to provide the services, facilities
and equipment as set forth in the application; and
   D.   In the course of considering an application for a renewed franchise,
the city council shall adhere to all requirements of applicable law. In the
event the city makes a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be
renewed, the city or the city's hearing body shall hold a public hearing or
hearings, in which the grantee seeking renewal shall be afforded a fair
opportunity for full participation, including the right to testify, to require
the production of and to introduce evidence, and to question witnesses. Notice
of any such public hearing shall, at least thirty (30) working days before the
date of the hearing, be published in a local newspaper of general circulation
in the city and be sent by certified mail to each applicant to be considered. A
transcript shall be made of such hearing.
Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of such hearing, the city
council shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for
renewal based on the record of such proceeding. The city shall transmit a copy
of said decision to the applicant. If the proposal is granted, the parties
shall proceed to negotiate the terms and conditions of a renewed franchise. Any
denial of an application for a renewed franchise shall be based on one or more
adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subsection A of
this section, pursuant to the requirements of applicable law. Neither grantee
nor the city shall be deemed to have waived any right it may have under federal
or state law by participating in a proceeding pursuant to this subsection.
(Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-9: FRANCHISE ACCEPTANCE:
A franchise and its terms and conditions shall be in writing, in a form
acceptable to the city attorney, and shall be executed and filed with the city
clerk within thirty (30) days after the granting of the franchise by the city
council. By accepting a franchise, a grantee declares that it has read the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and accepts all of the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise. In accepting a
franchise, a grantee warrants that it has relied upon its own investigation of
all relevant facts, that it had the assistance of counsel, that it was not
induced to accept a franchise, and that it accepts all reasonable risks related
to the franchise.
In the event that the city annexes additional territory, this chapter
automatically extends to right of way within such annexed areas, and all
provisions apply without need for amendment. Any facilities and appurtenances
in streets, alleys, rights of way and public places, incidental to the
franchise system that have been, or are at any future time acquired, newly
constructed, leased or utilized in any manner by grantee are thereupon to be
deemed authorized by and shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-10: FRANCHISE PERFORMANCE BOND:
Under appropriate circumstances, the grantee may be required to, within thirty
(30) days of the effective date of any franchise granted under this chapter or
within thirty (30) days of the granting of a renewal or the transfer of a
franchise, furnish to the city a performance bond. The performance bond shall
guarantee compliance with the terms and conditions of the franchise and payment
of all sums which may become due to the city under this chapter or franchise
issued pursuant hereto. The performance bond shall be maintained in the full
amount specified in the franchise, throughout the term of the franchise and for
one year after the franchise expires or is terminated, without reduction or
allowances for any amounts which are withdrawn or paid pursuant to this
chapter. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-11: EQUALITY OF FRANCHISE FEES AND COSTS:
In the event city charges or imposes upon grantee any fees, taxes or other
costs in connection with the issuance, maintenance, existence, or continuation,
or use of the franchise, or the public rights of way governed hereby, granted
pursuant to this chapter, then city shall impose equivalent charges, fees,
taxes, or costs upon any other franchisee in the same business or competing
with the grantee. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-12: LEGAL ACQUISITION BY PURCHASE OR CONDEMNATION:
The granting of a franchise shall not preclude the city from acquiring by
purchase or condemnation any or all of the equipment, facilities or other
improvements installed by the grantee within the right of way or other public
property within the city by such legal means as would have been available to
such municipality if no such franchise had been granted. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-13: NONINTERFERENCE WITH CITY PROPERTY:
The city shall have prior and superior right to the use of its streets, alleys,
and public properties for installation and maintenance of its property and
improvements for governmental purposes, and should a conflict arise with the
grantee's facilities that affects the interest of public health, safety and
welfare, the grantee shall, at its own expense and cost, unless otherwise
provided by law, relocate its facilities to accommodate such uses and purposes
of the city.
The owners of all utilities, public or private, installed in or on such public
properties prior to the installation of the lines and facilities of the
grantee, shall have preference as to the positioning and location of such
utilities so installed with respect to the grantee. Such preference shall
continue in the event of the necessity of relocating or changing the grade of
any such public properties.
Grantee's system shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to
interfere with any public use, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits or
other facilities that may have been laid in the rights of way by or under the
city's authority. In the event a facility location is determined unsuitable,
the director of community development or designee will work with grantee to
identify a new mutually acceptable location. Every effort will be made to
minimize additional cost to grantee as a new location is determined. (Ord. 155,
11-7-2006)
8-8-14: RIGHTS OF GRANTEE; LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
The grantee shall have the right and authority, to the extent expressed in the
franchise, to enter upon the right of way and other public property designated
by said franchise for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating
necessary equipment, facilities and other improvements within such property, in
conformity with local, state and federal statutes and regulations now in force
or hereinafter enacted governing such utilities.
Grantee's facilities installed after the date of this chapter shall be located
below the public right of way or public property, in conformance with national,
state and city standards including custom or practice in the city and adjacent
areas. Grantee is authorized to locate, at grade or aboveground, components of
the facilities including, but not limited to, manholes, transformers, junction
enclosures, switches, monuments, signs, associated equipment and facilities and
other structures or improvements as reasonably approved by the city director of
community development or designee. In the event grantee is unable, finds it
impractical or is precluded by law from placing its facilities underground,
such information shall be presented and considered by the city with respect to
the location of grantee's facilities.
Grantee's facilities, as of the date of this chapter, which are located above
the public right of way or public property, in conformance with national, state
and city standards, may be maintained by grantee in their present configuration
and use. Grantee is authorized to modify the facilities as necessary to serve
its customers and protect the public's health and safety. Should the grantee
desire to substantially change the character and use of its facilities, the
parties shall meet, confer and reach agreement on the placement of such
facilities underground. In the event the city and grantee are unable to reach
agreement, this matter shall be subject to section
8-8-30 of this chapter. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-15: CONSTRUCTION APPROVAL AND INSPECTION:
The grantee shall construct and install its equipment, facilities and other
improvements in the right of way or other public property pursuant to plans and
specifications approved by the city and under the supervision and inspection of
a supervisor or inspector provided by the city at the expense of such grantee,
except in instances in which deviation may be allowed in writing by the
director of community development pursuant to application by the grantee. The
city review of plans and specifications and inspections shall be related to use
of right of way or public property.
When appropriate, all plans and specifications shall specify the class and type
of material and equipment to be used, manner of excavation, construction and
installation, backfill, erection of temporary structures, erection of permanent
structures, and the traffic control mitigation measures as provided by the
"Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices", or similar standards as may be
applicable from time to time. The plans must conform to all federal, state,
county and city laws, public works standards and regulations, and other
agencies with jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, any excavations and
installations by the grantee in any of the public properties within the
corporate limits of the city shall be done in accordance with the ordinances,
regulations, and resolutions of general application now enacted or to be
enacted by the city council, relating to excavations in public properties of
the city, and authorized by the director.
Said ordinances, regulations, authorizations, and resolutions shall be for the
purposes of fulfilling the city's public trustee role in administering the
primary use and purpose of public properties, and not for relieving the grantee
of any duty, obligation, or responsibility for the competent design,
construction, maintenance, and operation of its facilities. Grantee is
responsible for the supervision, condition, and quality of the work done,
whether it is by itself or by contractors, assigns or agencies. With respect to
any excavations within the franchised area undertaken by or on behalf of
grantee or city, nothing herein is intended, nor shall be construed, to relieve
either party of their respective obligations arising under applicable law with
respect to determining the location of utility facilities. (Ord. 155, 11-7-
2006)
8-8-16: SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
During any period of work relating to grantee's facilities, all surface
structures and equipment, if any, shall be erected and used in such places and
positions within or adjacent to public rights of way and other public
properties so as to interfere as little as possible with the free passage of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic and the free use of adjoining property.
Grantee shall, at all times, post and maintain proper barricades and comply
with all applicable safety regulations during such period of construction as
required by the ordinances of the city, conditions of permits, and laws and
regulations of the state of Washington, specifically including Revised Code of
Washington 39.04.180 for the construction of trench safety systems.
If grantee shall at any time be required, or plan, to excavate trenches in any
area covered by this chapter, the grantee shall afford the city an opportunity
to permit other grantees and utilities to share such excavated trenches,
provided that: a) such joint use shall not unreasonably delay the work of the
grantee, and b) such joint use shall not adversely affect grantee's facilities
or safety thereof. Joint users will be required to contribute to the costs of
excavation and filling on a pro rata basis. Notification will be done by city.
If the number of competing grantees and utilities requesting joint use is
beyond a reasonable accommodation in any said ditch, a mutually agreed upon set
of determination criteria will be established by the director of community
development and all utilities involved. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-17: TIME FOR START AND COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION; TERMINATION OF
FRANCHISE:
The grantee, its successors or assigns, shall commence system construction
within the time stated within the franchise, and shall complete and have in
operation such portion of the system as may be specified in the franchise or
the franchise shall be voidable by the city and the rights therein conferred
upon the grantee may cease and terminate. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-18: RESTORATION AFTER CONSTRUCTION:
Grantee shall, after installation, construction, relocation, maintenance, or
repair of facilities within the area of the franchise, restore the surface of
the right of way to at least the condition existing prior to grantee's
activities, or as mutually agreed upon between grantee and the director through
a right of way permit, provided all work is compliant with the city public
works standards. Grantee agrees to promptly complete all restoration work and
to promptly repair any damage caused by such work within the area of the
franchise or other affected area at its sole cost and expense. In cases where
joint use attachments are found, the remaining joint use parties will be
responsible. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-19: DAMAGE AND NONCOMPLIANCE:
Any and all damage, or injury, done or caused to city rights of way, city
facilities, or any portion thereof in the construction, operation, maintenance
or repair of grantee's facilities shall be expeditiously repaired and
reconstructed pursuant to city standards or specifications.
In the event the grantee shall fail, neglect, or refuse to immediately repair
and reconstruct said damage or injury to said city rights of way or facilities,
the same may be done by the city and the reasonable cost and expense shall be
immediately paid by the grantee to the city.
If it is discovered by the city that grantee has damaged, injured, or failed to
restore the right of way in accordance with this chapter, the city shall
provide the grantee with written notice including a description of actions the
city believes necessary to restore the right of way. If the right of way is not
restored within ten (10) working days from receipt of written notice, the city,
or its authorized agent, may restore the right of way and facilities. The
grantee is responsible for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses
incurred by the city to repair and restore the right of way and facilities in
accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-20: PROTECTION OF MONUMENTS:
Before any work is performed under the franchise which may affect any existing
monuments or markers of any nature relating to subdivisions, plats, roads, and
all other surveys, the grantee shall reference all such monuments and markers.
The reference points shall be so located that they will not be disturbed during
the grantee's operations under the franchise. All concrete encased recorded
monuments which have been disturbed or displaced by such work shall be restored
pursuant to state and federal standards and specifications. The replacement of
all such monuments or markers disturbed during construction shall be made as
expeditiously as the conditions permit.
The reasonable, out of pocket and documented cost of monuments or other markers
lost, destroyed, or disturbed during construction or other use, and the expense
of replacement of approved monuments and other marker ties which have been
reestablished or disturbed shall be borne by the grantee. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-21: CONSTRUCTION PERMITS REQUIRED:
Unless otherwise permitted, whenever grantee shall occupy or excavate in any
public right of way or other public property for the purpose of installation,
construction, repair, maintenance or relocation of its facilities, it shall
apply to the city, and pay fees established by city council resolution, for a
permit ("construction permit") to do so, together with detailed plans and
specifications showing the position, depth, and location of all such facilities
in relation to existing rights of way, roads, streets, or other public
property, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "plans". Grantee's
specifications shall be considered the same as the grantee's "plans" and shall
be supplied with the initial or renewed franchise. All work within any public
rights of way or on other public property shall be pursuant to a valid permit
and city ordinance. The permit for individual jobs shall list a general
description of the work to be performed and shall specify a schedule for the
work. With respect to any excavations within the franchised area undertaken by
or on behalf of grantee or city, nothing herein is intended, nor shall be
construed, to relieve either party of the respective obligations arising under
applicable law with respect to determining the location of utility facilities.
During the progress of the work, grantee shall not unnecessarily obstruct the
passage or proper use of the rights of way. All restoration of rights of way,
roads, streets, storm drainage and the surface of other public property shall
be in conformance with city public works standards, and conditions of the
permit.
In addition to any criteria set forth by ordinance, the director of community
development shall apply the following criteria in the issuance or denial of a
construction permit application:
   A.   Whether the grantee has received all requisite licenses, certificates,
and authorizations from applicable federal, state, and local agencies with
jurisdiction over the activities proposed by the grantee;
   B.   The capacity of the right of way or street to accommodate the grantee's
proposed facilities ("capacity" means the ability of the property to
accommodate the facility without interfering with the reasonable use and
function of other existing utilities or permitted encroachments) prior to
issuing permits; and
   C.   The availability of alternate routes and/or locations for the proposed
facilities.
The grantee shall give the city at least forty eight (48) hours' notice of the
grantee's intent to commence work. The grantee shall file plans or maps with
the city showing the proposed location of its utility facilities and pay all
duly established permit and inspection fees associated with the processing of
the permit. In no case shall any work commence within any public way without
said permit, except in an emergency or as otherwise provided in the franchise
or authority of the city. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-22: RELOCATION:
City shall notify grantee of any intended or expected requirement or request to
relocate grantee's facilities as early as practicable. City shall endeavor to
cause any such relocation to be consistent with any applicable public funded
long term development plan or projection of the city or approved by the city.
If, at any time, the city shall require such relocation, the grantee, upon
written notice from the city, shall, with all convenient speed, change the
location or readjust the elevation of its system and other facilities.
   A.   Whenever the city causes the construction of any publicly funded
project, in whole or in part, within the franchise area or on public grounds
and such construction necessitates the relocation of grantee's facilities from
their existing location within the franchise area or on such public grounds and
places, such relocation will be at no cost to the city.
   B.   In the event an emergency posing a threat to public safety or welfare
requires the relocation of grantee's facilities, the city shall give notice of
the emergency as soon as reasonably practicable. Upon receipt of such notice
from the city, grantee shall endeavor to respond as soon as reasonably
practicable to relocate the affected facilities, at no cost to the city.
   C.   Whenever any third party requires the relocation of grantee's
facilities to accommodate work of such third party within the franchise area or
on such public grounds then the grantee shall have the right as a condition of
any such relocation to require payment to grantee, at a time and upon terms
acceptable to grantee, for any and all costs and expenses incurred by grantee
in the relocation of their facilities, as provided for by applicable law,
regulation or tariff. Where the relocation of grantee's facilities is due in
part to development or improvement of a third party's property, which also
results in construction of a city project consistent with the city's capital
facilities plan, transportation improvement program or transportation
facilities program, grantee's costs and expenses of relocation shall be
proportionally allocated. For example, if one thousand (1,000) linear feet of
grantee's facilities must be relocated and two hundred fifty (250) linear feet
of the relocated facilities are to facilitate the third party development, then
twenty five percent (25%) of the cost of relocation shall be apportioned to the
third party. The city shall not be responsible for any cost or expense
associated with the relocation of grantee's facilities.
   D.   As to any relocation of grantee facilities whereby the cost and expense
thereof is to be borne by grantee, grantee may submit in writing to the city
alternatives to relocation of its facilities. Upon the city's receipt from
grantee of such written alternatives, the city shall evaluate such alternatives
and shall advise grantee in writing if one or more of such alternatives are
suitable. In the event the city reasonably determines that such alternatives
are not appropriate, grantee shall relocate its facilities as originally
requested. City will use every reasonable effort in design stages to limit
relocation.
   E.   If the city requires the subsequent relocation of any facilities within
five (5) years from the date of relocation of such facilities or installation
of new facilities, the city shall bear the entire cost of such subsequent
relocation. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-23: VACATION:
If, at any time, the city shall vacate any road, right of way or other public
property which is subject to rights granted by the franchise, such vacation
shall be subject to the reservation of a perpetual easement to the grantee for
the purpose of operating and maintaining the facilities of the grantee and
other public utilities. The city shall, in its vacation procedure, reserve and
grant said easement to the grantee for grantee's facilities and shall also
expressly prohibit any use of the vacated properties, which will interfere with
grantee's full enjoyment and use of said easement. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-24: MAINTENANCE:
Grantee shall install and maintain its facilities in a manner so as to prevent
damage to the city's property. Grantee, solely at its own expense, shall
repair, renew, change, and improve said facilities from time to time as may be
necessary to maintain the same in good condition. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-25: EMERGENCY RESPONSE:
The grantee shall, within sixty (60) days of the execution of the franchise by
the grantee, file with the city and adhere to an emergency management plan (the
"plan") for responding to an emergency condition which has a significant effect
on any property, life, health, or safety. The plan shall designate responsible
officials and emergency twenty four (24) hour on call personnel and the
procedures to be followed when responding to an emergency. If grantee does not
already have a plan in place, the grantee shall work with the director of
community development and the city's police chief in developing such a plan to
determine when and how the same should be contacted during emergencies. After
being notified of an emergency, grantee shall cooperate with the city and make
every effort to immediately respond with action to minimize damage and to
protect the health and safety of the public.
If grantee refuses to take the emergency action within a reasonable time and
conditions exist which require immediate action to prevent imminent injury or
damages to persons or property, the city may take such actions as it believes
are necessary to protect persons or property. Grantee shall be responsible to
reimburse the city for its reasonable, out of pocket and documented costs and
any expenses. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-26: EMERGENCY WORK:
In the event of any emergency in which any of grantee's facilities break, are
damaged, or if grantee's facilities or construction areas are otherwise in such
a condition as to immediately endanger any property, life, health, or safety,
grantee shall immediately inform the city of the location and condition and
shall immediately take all necessary actions to repair its facilities, and to
cure or remedy any dangerous conditions. Such emergency work may be commenced
without first applying for and obtaining a permit as required by this chapter.
However, this provision shall not relieve grantee from the requirement of
obtaining any permits necessary for this purpose, and grantee shall thereafter
apply for all such permits. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-27: DANGEROUS CONDITIONS; AUTHORITY OF CITY TO ABATE:
Whenever excavation, installation, construction, repair, maintenance, or
relocation of facilities has caused a condition that substantially impairs the
lateral support of the adjoining right of way, road, street or other public
place, or endangers the public, adjoining public or private property or street
utilities, the city may direct grantee, at grantee's sole expense, to take all
necessary actions to protect the public and property. The city may require that
such action be completed within a prescribed reasonable time frame.
In the event that grantee fails or refuses to promptly take the actions
directed by the city, or fails to fully comply with such directions, or if
emergency conditions exist which require immediate action, the city may enter
upon the property and take such actions as are necessary to protect the public,
adjacent public or private property, or right of way use, or to maintain the
lateral support thereof, and all other actions deemed by the city to be
necessary to preserve the public safety and welfare.
Grantee shall be liable to the city for all reasonable documented costs and
expenses thereof to the extent caused by grantee. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-28: TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL:
A franchise issued pursuant to this chapter thereto shall not be sold,
assigned, transferred, leased, or disposed of, either in whole or in part,
either by involuntary sale or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise hypothecated in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or
equitable, control thereof, or any right, interest, or property therein pass to
or vest in any person or entity, nor shall the controlling interest in any
corporation holding a franchise hereunder be changed in a manner reasonably
anticipated to diminish substantially grantee's ability or likelihood of
performing its obligations under the franchise, without the prior consent of
the city council; such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or only under
such conditions as may be required by the city council; provided, however, such
transfer of control shall not include transfer to a parent, subsidiary, or
affiliate of a grantee, except when such transfer is intended to avoid
application of this section. Every type of sale, assignment change, transfer,
or acquisition of control of a franchisee issued pursuant to this chapter
thereto shall make a franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the
city shall have consented. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-29: SUCCESSORS TO GRANTEE:
All the provisions, conditions, regulations and requirements herein contained
shall be binding upon the successors, assigns and independent contractors of
the grantee and all privileges of the grantee shall inure to successors,
assigns and contractors. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-30: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
   A.   Notice Of Dispute: If either party has a dispute under this chapter, it
shall provide written and electronic notice to the other party. The notice
shall provide a brief description of the dispute.
   B.   Meet And Confer: Following delivery of notice to the other party, the
parties shall, within ten (10) business days from the date the notice is
delivered, meet and confer to discuss and attempt, in good faith, to resolve

If the grantee, its successors or assigns, wilfully violate or fail to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter or franchise, fail to make timely
payment of any fee, charge for additional actual costs and expenses incurred by
the city, or through wilful or unreasonable neglect fail to heed or comply with
any notice given the grantee under the provisions of such grant, then the said

8-8-33: GRANTEE TO INDEMNIFY CITY:

city from all claims, actions, damages, costs and attorney fees of every kind

material or equipment, or maintenance, or by the improper occupation of said
right of way by the said grantee or by reason of the negligent, improper or
faulty manner relating to any excavation, temporary turnouts or inefficient
operation by the grantee of its facilities in streets, avenues, alleys, roads
and public places as hereinbefore designated, and in case that suit or action
is brought against the city for damages arising out of or by reason of any of
the above mentioned causes, the grantee, its successors or assigns, will, upon
notice to it or them of the commencement of said action, defend the same at its
or their sole cost and expense and in case judgment shall be rendered against
the city in suit or action, will fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90)
days after the said suit or action shall have been finally determined, if
determined adversely to the city; provided, that the grantee therein, its
successors or assigns, shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any
cause or action and be given the management of the defense thereof. (Ord. 155,
11-7-2006)
8-8-34: EXTENT OF GRANTEE'S OBLIGATIONS:
The obligations imposed upon the grantee by the terms of the franchise, or this
chapter or any other ordinance affecting the same, shall be deemed to include
every employee, nominee or independent contractor of the grantee performing
work in the city streets, or other city property, under contract direction,
request or authority of the grantee under the franchise, and the grantee, its
agent, employee or independent contractor, severally, shall be responsible to
the city for any injury or damage to city property or the expense incurred or
suffered by the city in correcting defects in work replacing city streets or
other improvements damaged by the acts or neglect of such servants, agents or
independent contractors of grantee. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-35: FRANCHISE FEE:
To the extent authorized by applicable law, there may be imposed as a condition
of the grant of a franchise and in consideration thereof, a franchise fee.
Amount of such fee shall be established by resolution or the terms of the
franchise.
   A.   Any payment that may be due shall be due thirty (30) days past the
close of the grantee's calendar or tax quarter for which revenue was received
or thirty (30) days past the invoice date received from the city.
   B.   In the event that any franchise payment is not received by the city on
or before the applicable date due, interest shall be charged from such date at
the legally permissible rate.
   C.   In addition, if any payment due is not paid by the due date, the city
shall add a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount due; and if the payment
is not received on or before the last day of the month following the due date,
the city shall add a total penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount due.
   D.   In the event a franchise is revoked or otherwise terminated prior to
its expiration date, a grantee shall file with the city, within ninety (90)
days of the date of revocation or termination, all payments due.
   E.   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the city's authority to tax a
grantee, or to collect any fee or charge permitted by law, and no immunity from
any such obligations shall attach to a grantee by virtue of this chapter. No
acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an
accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or
additional sums payable as a franchise fee, if applicable, or for the
performance of any other obligation of the grantee. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-36: CHARGE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS:
There may be imposed, in addition to a franchise fee (if legally applicable), a
charge for the reasonable and documented administrative costs and expenses
incurred by the city in supervision, inspection and examination of such work
granted by a permit and done by the grantee or by an independent contractor
under the franchise of the grantee. Such charge shall be due and payable thirty
(30) days after the date of the invoice. Thereafter, interest shall accrue at
the legally permissible rate. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-37: LIQUIDATED DAMAGES:
Because a grantee's failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter and
its franchise will result in damage to the city and because it will be
impractical to determine the actual amount of such damages, the city and any
grantee may agree upon and specify in a franchise certain amounts which
represent both parties' best estimate of the damages. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-38: CIVIL PENALTIES AND ADDITIONAL RELIEF:
   A.   In addition to any penalty which may be imposed by the city, any
grantee violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this title
or any franchise issued pursuant thereto shall be liable for any and all damage
to city property or rights of way arising from such violation, including the
cost of restoring the affected area to its condition prior to the violation.
   B.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, the city may seek
legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any
condition which constitutes or will constitute a violation of the applicable
provisions of this title or any franchise issued pursuant thereto when civil or
criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance.
   C.   In addition to the penalties set forth in this section, violation of
any provision of this title or any franchise issued pursuant thereto may also
result in the revocation and termination of any franchise, permit, or other
agreement or authorization in accordance with section
8-8-39, "Revocation And Termination", of this chapter. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-39: REVOCATION AND TERMINATION:
   A.   In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city under
this chapter and any franchise issued pursuant thereto, the city council
reserves the right to revoke and terminate a franchise and all rights and
privileges of a grantee in the event of a substantial violation or breach of
its terms and conditions. A substantial violation or breach by a grantee shall
include, but shall not be limited to, any of the following acts or omissions:
      1.   An uncured substantial violation of any material provision of this
chapter or an uncured breach of any material provision of a franchise issued
hereunder, or any material rule, order or regulation of the city made pursuant
to its power to protect the public health, safety and welfare;
      2.   Any default in the performance of any of grantee's material
obligations under any other documents, agreements and other terms and
provisions entered into by and between the city and the grantee;
      3.   An intentional evasion or knowing attempt to evade any material
provision of a franchise or practice of any fraud or deceit upon the
subscribers or upon the city;
      4.   Failure to begin or substantially complete any system construction
or system extension as set forth in a franchise;
      5.   Failure to provide the services promised in the application or
specified in a franchise or a reasonable substitute therefor;
      6.   Any use or occupation of the right of way that presents a risk to
public health or safety or the construction, installation, operation or
maintenance of a system in an unsafe or dangerous manner;
      7.   The wilful violation of any orders or rulings of any regulatory body
having jurisdiction over grantee relative to the franchise;
      8.   Misrepresentation of material fact in the application for, or during
negotiations relating to, a franchise;
      9.   A continuous and wilful pattern of inadequate service or failure to
respond to legitimate subscriber complaints;
      10.   Failure to provide insurance, bonds, letter of credit, or indemnity
as required by a franchise or this chapter;
      11.   An uncured failure to pay franchise fees as required by the
franchise agreement.
   B.   None of the foregoing shall constitute a substantial violation or
breach if the grantee is without fault or if the violation or breach occurs as
a result of circumstances beyond a grantee's reasonable control. A grantee
shall bear the burden of proof in establishing the existence of such
circumstances. However, a grantee's substantial violation or breach shall not
be excused by economic hardship or by nonfeasance or malfeasance of its
directors, officers, employees, agents or contractors.
Any termination or revocation shall be in accordance with section
8-8-40, "Procedures For Termination", of this chapter. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-40: PROCEDURES FOR TERMINATION:
   A.   Any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter may be terminated in
accordance with the following procedures:
      1.   The director of community development, or designee, shall notify the
grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged substantial violation or
breach constituting a ground for termination. Said notice shall provide that
the grantee shall have sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice to
correct and cure such alleged substantial violation or breach or to present
facts and argument in refutation of the alleged substantial violation or
breach. A copy of said notice of substantial violation or breach shall be
mailed to the surety on any performance bond.
      2.   If a grantee corrects any alleged substantial violation or breach
within the sixty (60) day cure period, then in no event shall the violation be
weighed against such grantee in any subsequent review of franchise performance.
      3.   If a grantee does not correct and cure the alleged substantial
violation or breach within the sixty (60) day cure period then the city council
shall, within forty five (45) days of the last day of the sixty (60) day cure
period, designate the hearing examiner as the hearing officer to conduct a
public hearing to determine if the revocation and termination of the franchise
is warranted and to make a recommendation to the city council. That
recommendation shall be transmitted to the city council for final action on a
closed record. The city council shall act as the final decision maker.
      4.   At least twenty (20) days prior to the public hearing, the city
clerk shall issue a public hearing notice and order that shall: establish the
issue(s) to be addressed in the public hearing; provide the time, date and
location of the hearing; provide that the city shall hear any persons
interested therein; and provide that the grantee shall be afforded fair
opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence,
to require the production of evidence, to be represented by counsel and to
question witnesses.
      5.   The hearing examiner shall hear testimony, take evidence, hear oral
argument and receive written briefs. The hearing examiner shall create for the
city council a complete record of the public hearing including all exhibits
introduced at the hearing and an electronic sound recording.
      6.   The grantee carries the burden of proof and must demonstrate that a
preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that there is not an
uncured substantial violation or breach or that the substantial violation or
breach is a result of circumstances beyond a grantee's reasonable control.
      7.   Within ten (10) working days after the close of the record the
hearing examiner shall issue a written decision that shall include the
recommendation of the hearing examiner on the revocation and termination of the
grantee's franchise, a finding of facts upon which the recommendation is based
and the conclusions derived from those facts.
   B.   The city council shall, at a public meeting, consider and take final
action on the recommendation of the hearing examiner. The city council shall
not accept new information, written or oral, but shall consider the complete
record developed before the hearing examiner and the recommendation of the
hearing examiner.
   C.   At the public meeting the city council shall either:
      1.   Accept the recommendation of the hearing examiner; or
      2.   Reject the recommendation of the hearing examiner; or
      3.   Remand the decision to the hearing examiner and the director for an
additional hearing limited to specific issues identified by the council.
   D.   The city council shall adopt an ordinance which accepts or rejects the
recommendation of the hearing examiner by a majority vote of the membership of
the council. If the action by the city council will result in the revocation
and termination of a grantee's franchise then the ordinance shall declare that
the franchise of such grantee shall be revoked and terminated, any security
fund or bonds are forfeited, and shall include findings of fact and conclusions
derived from those facts which support the decision of the council. The city
council may by reference adopt some or all of the findings and conclusions of
the hearing examiner. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-41: FORCE MAJEURE:
In the event the grantee's performance of any of the terms and conditions or
obligations required by this chapter is prevented by a cause or event not
within the grantee's control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused
and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof; provided,
however, that shall not relieve a grantee from its general obligations required
when interruptions in service occur. For the purpose of this section, causes or
events not within the control of the grantee shall include, without
limitations, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances,
restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, explosions, acts
of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes,
landslides, and fires, but shall not include financial inability of the grantee
to perform or failure of the grantee to obtain any necessary permits or
licenses from other governmental agencies or the right to use the facilities of
any public utility where such failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of
the grantee, or the failure of the grantee to secure supplies, services or
equipment necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of
the cable communications system where the grantee has failed to exercise
reasonable diligence to secure such supplies, services or equipment. (Ord. 155,
11-7-2006)
8-8-42: RECORDS:
As a condition of this chapter, and at its sole expense, grantee agrees to
provide the city with available as built plans, potential improvement plans,
field locates, maps, plats, and specifications of its facilities within city
rights of way upon reasonable request. Grantee shall provide GIS data or field
locate its facilities in order to facilitate design and planning of city
improvement projects. Copies of the above documents shall be made available in
paper and digital or electronic format.
The parties agree to periodically share and deliver geographic information
system (GIS) data upon written request, provided the GIS data are to be used
solely for governmental purposes. Any data provided to grantee shall be
restricted to information required for grantee's engineering needs for
installation, repair or replacement of facilities that are the subject of the
franchise. Grantee is prohibited from selling any GIS information obtained from
city to any third parties. GIS data provided to the city by grantee is
proprietary and shall not be distributed in any form to third parties outside
of the city. As to any such data so provided, grantee does not warrant the
accuracy thereof and, to the extent the location of facilities are shown, such
facilities may be shown in their approximate location. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)
8-8-43: PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ACT:
Grantee acknowledges that information submitted to the city may be subject to
inspection and copying under the Washington public disclosure act codified in
chapter 42.56 Revised Code of Washington. Grantee shall mark as "CONFIDENTIAL"
each page or portion thereof of any documentation/information which it submits
to the city and which it believes is exempt from public inspection or copying.
The city agrees to provide the grantee with a copy of any public disclosure
request to inspect or copy documentation/information which the grantee has
provided to the city and marked as "CONFIDENTIAL" prior to allowing any
inspection and/or copying as well as provide the grantee with a time frame,
consistent with state law, to provide the city with its written basis for
nondisclosure of the requested documentation/information. In the event the city
disagrees with the grantee's basis for nondisclosure, the city agrees to
withhold release of the requested documentation/information in dispute for a
reasonable period solely determined by the city, so that the grantee can file a
legal action under state law. (Ord. 155, 11-7-2006)

north and south addresses and Division Street or Division Street extended
divides the City into east and west addresses.
         b.   North of Sprague addresses have even numbers on the east side of
the street/road and odd numbers on the west side; south of Sprague even numbers
are on the west side of the street/road and odd numbers are on the east with
the exception of the Legacy Ridge and Legacy Ridge West Developments within the
City of Liberty Lake where due to the layout and orientation of the streets,
the numbers do not always follow the standard practice as the streets change
directions; however the numbering for the development is consistently followed
throughout the development.
         c.   West of Division Street addresses have even numbers on the north
side and odd numbers on the south side of the road; east of Division Street
even numbers are assigned to the south side of the road and odd numbers are on
the north side with the exception of the Legacy Ridge and Legacy Ridge West
Developments within the City of Liberty Lake where due to the layout and
orientation of the streets, the numbers do not always follow the standard
practice as the streets change directions; however the numbering for the
development is consistently followed throughout the development.
         d.   The appropriate directional designation, or abbreviation of the
word itself (e.g., "N." or "North"), is part of the address and follows the
number. For example, the first lot south of Sprague Avenue on the west side of
Division Street would have a street address of "1 S. Division Street".
   B.   Addressing Standards:
      1.   Each property owner who has addressable property and has not been
assigned an address has a responsibility to apply to the addressing authority
for a physical address.

address numbers. The hundred series shall change upon crossing a road
intersection or in best possible alignment with the established address grid if
applicable, with the exception of intersecting driveways and/or alleys. The
hundred series along a public road shall not change upon crossing a private
road, unless deemed necessary by the addressing authority. Private roads wholly
contained within plats shall be assigned hundred series as if they were public
roads.
      5.   Addresses along a street/road shall have even numbers on one side of
the road and odd numbers on the other side as defined in the appropriate
addressing grid.
      6.   Individual address numbers shall be assigned to fit within the block
range of the road segment to which the address is assigned (e.g., a new address
that is assigned to the 200 block of Main St, must be assigned a number between
200 and 299). Individual addresses should be assigned to be consistent with
adjacent blocks of the same N-S or E-W orientation.
      7.   Properties only accessible via a shared driveway shall be assigned
based on the point of origin of the driveway from the connecting street/road
and shall be sequential.
      8.   Addressable property or structures shall be assigned an address
based upon the street/road from which vehicular access to the property or
structure is obtained, with the following exceptions:
         a.   Commercial and public facility structures may be assigned an
address based upon the street/road the main entrance faces and not necessarily
the access road.
         b.   Residential structures on corner lots may be assigned an address
based upon the street/road the main entrance faces and not necessarily the
access road.
         c.   Per the City Development Code section 10-3G-2(S) and the River
District SAP-08-0001 section 10-3G-2(P) for street names and addresses, if a
building does not have street frontage (e.g., common area or pedestrian path
frontage), then the address shall be provided based on the street connection
point for vehicular access and appropriate signage shall be provided for public
safety.
      9.   Fractional addresses shall not be used (e.g., "1001/2 W Main St.").
      10.   Address numbers shall not contain any non-numeric characters (e.g.,
"118a" or "118b").
   C.   Change In Street/Road Or Address Status:
      1.   If a public or private street/road right-of-way is altered, the
addressing authority shall review the alteration and may assign a corrected
street/road name and/or address/addresses consistent with the provisions of
this chapter. If the access to an individual address is altered, the addressing
authority shall assign a corrected address consistent with the provisions of
this chapter (e.g., the owners of 200 W Cherry Ln. change the location of their
driveway from Cherry Ln. to Spruce Ln. necessitating an address on Spruce Ln.).

Article 10-1A — How to Use the Development Code
Welcome to the City of Liberty Lake Development Code. This is a comprehensive land use and
development code that governs all of the land within the incorporated limits of the City of Liberty Lake.
The five chapters of the Code are used together to review land use applications. They are organized
as follows:
Chapter 1 - In addition to this brief introduction, Chapter 1 provides definitions for selected terms and
information on the legal construct of the Code. It also explains the city authority to enforce the
Development Code.
Chapter 2 - Every parcel, lot, and tract of land within the City’s incorporated boundaries is also within
a “zoning district”. (Zoning districts are shown on the City’s official zoning map.) Chapter 2 identifies the
land uses that are permitted within each district, and the standards that apply to each type of land use
(e.g., lot standards, setbacks, and use-specific design standards). As required by state law, the zones
or “zoning districts” conform to the City of Liberty Lake Comprehensive Plan. The districts reserve land
for planned land uses, provide compatibility between different uses, and implement planned housing
densities.
Chapter 3 - The design and maintenance standards contained in Chapter 3 apply throughout the City.
They are used in preparing development plans, and reviewing applications, to ensure compliance with
city standards for access and circulation, landscaping, parking, signage, storage, public facilities,
surface water management, and critical areas. Additionally, this chapter contains property maintenance
standards.
Chapter 4 - Chapter 4 provides all of the application requirements and procedures for obtaining permits
required by this Code. Five types of permit procedures are covered: Exempt, Type I, Type II, Type III,
and Type IV.
Chapter 5 - Chapter 5 provides standards and procedures for variances and non-conforming situations
(i.e., existing uses or development that do not comply with the Code). This Code cannot provide
standards to fit every potential development situation. The City’s varied geography, and complexities of
land development, require flexibility. Chapter 5 provides that flexibility, while maintaining the purposes
and intent of the Code.
Chapter 6 – Chapter 6 addresses environmental regulations within the City, include: environmental
review standards under the State Environmental Quality Review Act; critical area regulations; wellhead
protection; shoreline management regulations; environmental conservation; and flood damage
prevention regulations.

inspector is unable to locate the owner or such other persons, and he or she has reason to
believe that conditions therein create an immediate and irreparable land use or safety hazard,
he or she shall make entry.
C. Compliance with request. It is unlawful for any owner or occupant or any other person having
charge, care, or control of any building, structure, property, or portion thereof to fail or neglect
after proper request has been given to permit prompt entry where the inspector has reason to
believe that conditions therein create an immediate and irreparable land use or safety hazard.
D. Permits. Any person submitting an application for a permit issued pursuant to this Code shall
be deemed to have consented to on-site inspection of their property for the purpose of assessing
compliance with this Code.
10-1D-6 Abatement of Violations
Any development or use which occurs contrary to the provisions of this Code or contrary to any permit
or approval issued or granted under this Code is unlawful, and may be abated by appropriate
proceedings as outlined in this article. A finding of a violation of this Code and paying of a penalty shall
not relieve the responsible party of the duty to abate the violation. The penalties imposed by this article
are in addition to and not in lieu of any remedies available to the City.

10-2A-1 Classification of Zoning Districts
All areas within the City limits of the City of Liberty Lake are divided into zoning districts. The use
of each lot, parcel, and tract of land is limited to the uses permitted by the applicable zoning district
(see matrix in Section 10-2A-4). The applicable zoning district shall be determined based on the
Zoning District Map, and the provisions of this Article.
10-2A-2 Zoning Districts Map
A. Consistency with zoning district map. The boundaries of each of the zoning districts
contained within this article shall coincide with the zoning district boundaries identified
on the City’s official zoning map, retained by the City. Said map by this reference is
made a part of this Development Code. A certified print of the adopted zoning district
map, and any map amendments, shall be maintained by the City.
B. Applicability of zoning requirements. Each lot, tract, and parcel of land or portion thereof
within the zoning district boundaries as designated and marked on the zoning map, is
classified, zoned, and limited to the uses as hereinafter specified and defined for the
applicable district classification.
C. Split Zoning. In the event that a parcel contains more than one zoning district, the City
may, at the request of the property owner, make an administrative code interpretation
that the zoning designation associated with the largest portion of the parcel, shall apply
to the entire parcel.
D. Zoning district map amendments. All amendments to the City zoning district (zoning
map) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Article 10-4J.
1. Copies of all map amendments shall be dated with the effective date of the
ordinance adopting the map amendment, and shall be maintained without
change, together with the adopting documents, on file at the City; and
2. The City shall make available for public inspection an up-to-date copy of the
revised zoning district map, so that it accurately portrays changes of zone
boundaries or classification, as applicable.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 2 Page 2-3
10-2A-3 Determination of Zoning District Boundaries
Where due to the scale, lack of scale, lack of detail or illegibility of the City zoning district map,
or due to any other reason, there is uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended
location of district boundary lines, the boundary lines shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator in accordance with the following:
A. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways,
railroad tracks or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines;
B. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the boundaries of a parcel, lot, or tract
shall be construed as following such boundaries;
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following a City boundary, or the Urban Growth
Area Boundary, shall be construed as following said boundary;
D. Boundaries indicated as approximately following river, stream and/or drainage channels
or basins shall be construed as following river, stream and/or drainage channels or
basins, as applicable; and
E. Whenever any public right-of-way is lawfully vacated, the lands formerly within the
vacated right-of-way shall automatically be subject to the same zoning district
designation that is applicable to lands abutting the vacated area. In cases where the
right-of-way formerly served as a zoning district boundary, the lands formerly within the
vacated right-of-way shall be allocated proportionately between the subject zoning
districts.

Types of Uses
 Permitted Uses (P): Permitted uses are designated in matrix (10-2A-4) with the letter “P”.
These uses may occur without special action by the Hearing Body, subject to development
standards of the zone in which it is located, and other applicable portions of this Code.
 Limited Uses (L): Limited uses are designated in matrix (10-2A-4) with the letter “L”. These
uses are allowed if they comply with the development standards of the zone in which it is
located, and other applicable portions of this Code, including meeting the requirements for
the necessary permits or approvals. These uses include accessory uses, temporary uses,
home occupations, special uses, etc.
 Conditional Uses (CU): Conditional uses are designated in matrix (10-2A-4) with the letters
“CU”. Conditional uses are permitted to locate only after a public hearing and the decision
to grant a permit (conditional use permit) imposing such performance standards as will
make the use compatible with other permitted uses in the same vicinity and zone and ensure
against excessive interference with other permitted uses or imposing excessive demands
upon public utilities and facilities as determined by the Hearing Body. Conditional use
permits require a public hearing before the Hearing Examiner.
 Not Permitted (N): Uses designated in matrix (10-2A-4) with the letter “N” are not permitted.
All uses not specifically authorized by this Code are prohibited.
 Use Determinations: It is recognized that all possible uses and variations of uses cannot
be reasonably listed in a use matrix. The Zoning Administrator may classify uses not
specifically addressed in the matrix consistent with similar uses. Classifications shall also
be consistent with Comprehensive Plan policies.
 Essential Public Facilities (EPF's): Facilities that may have statewide or
regional/countywide significance are listed in the Facilities and Uses column as EPF and
shall additionally be evaluated to determine applicability with the “Spokane County Regional
Siting Process for Essential Public Facilities”, as amended.

are authorized, or a variance is approved by the City.
10-2B-6 Development Setbacks
Building setbacks provide space for private yards, and building separation for fire protection/security,
building maintenance, sunlight, and air circulation. This section is also intended to promote humanscale
design and traffic calming by downplaying the visual presence of garages along the street and
encouraging the use of extra-wide sidewalks and pocket parks in front of markets and other nonresidential
uses. The standards encourage placement of residences close to the street for public safety
and neighborhood security.
Building setbacks are the distance between a building (or other feature of development) and a property
line, right-of-way, auto-court lane, or street, as applicable; however no structures shall be located within
easements. Setbacks for decks and porches are measured from the edge of the deck or porch to the
property line. The setback standards, as listed and illustrated below, apply to primary structures as well
as accessory structures, unless otherwise specified above for Limited or Conditional Uses. A Variance
is required in accordance with Article 10-5B to modify any setback standard. If an existing border
easement is in place, the setback is measured from the back of the border easement, as applicable.

10-2B-8 Building Height
The following building height standards are intended to promote land use compatibility and support the
principle of neighborhood-scale design:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the R-1 Zone shall be no more than 35 feet tall.
Building height may be restricted to less than this maximum when necessary to comply with the
Building Height Transition standard in “C” below.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
building.
Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, roof equipment, flag poles, and
similar features which are not for human occupancy, but may be restricted in height to
protect views. Within residential zones, bell towers, steeples, and similar features are
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐24
included within the maximum height and shall conform to the height requirements of
the R-1 zone.
C. Building Height Transition. To provide compatible building scale and privacy between
developments, taller buildings shall “step-down” to create a building height transition to adjacent
single-story building(s).
1. This standard applies to new and vertically expanded buildings within 12 feet (as
measured horizontally) of an existing single-story building with a height of 20 feet or less,
as shown above.
2. The building height transition standard is met when the height of the taller building (“x”)
does not exceed one (1) foot of height for every one (1) foot of side yard separating the
two buildings (“y”), as shown above up to a maximum 10' required side yard setback
adjacent to the single story building.
10-2B-9 Building Orientation
A. Purpose. The following standards are intended to orient buildings close to streets to promote
human-scale development, slow traffic down, and encourage walking in neighborhoods. Placing
residences and other buildings close to the street also encourages security and safety by having
more “eyes-on-the-street”.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐25
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the R-1 Zone that require Site Design Review
(see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do not receive
the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical equipment; and
similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the R-1 zone are also required to comply with
the standards outlined above in Section 10-2B-3 or 10-2B-4. Buildings that do not require site
design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Building orientation standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall be oriented
to a street. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2B-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Commercial
building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby entrances, or
breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial spaces).
Alternatively, a building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a direct
pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in
accordance with the standards in Article 10-3B – Access and Circulation. In this case,
at least one entrance shall be provided not more than 30 feet from the closest sidewalk
or street.
3. Off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed between buildings
and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse enclosures shall be
oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent practical and shall not be
placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall be screened with a wall
of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3, subsection H.

10-2B-10 Architectural Guidelines and Special Standards
A. Purpose. The architectural guidelines are intended to provide detailed, human-scale design,
while affording flexibility to use a variety of building styles.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the R-1 Zone that require Site Design Review
(see Section 10-4C-2). Limited and Conditional Uses within the R-1 zone are also required to
comply with the standards outlined above in Section 10-2B-3 or 10-2B-4. Buildings that do not
require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall comply with all of the following

1. Building Form.
The continuous horizontal distance (i.e., as measured from end-wall to end-wall) of
individual buildings shall not exceed 160 feet. All buildings shall incorporate design
features such as offsets, balconies, projections, window reveals, or similar elements
to preclude large expanses of uninterrupted building surfaces, as shown in the above
Figure. Along the vertical face of a structure, such features shall occur at a minimum
of every 40 feet, and on each floor shall contain at least two of the following features:

visually distinguish and recognize individuals. For the purposes of granting a
conditional use permit for siting a secure community transition facility, the
Hearing Examiner shall consider an unobstructed visual distance of 600 feet to
be "within line of sight." Through the conditional use process, "line of sight" may
be considered to be less than 600 feet if the applicant can demonstrate that
visual barriers exist or can be created that would reduce the line of sight to less
than 600 feet. The law defines “risk potential activity” or “risk potential facility” to
mean “an activity or facility that provides a higher incidence of risk to the public
from persons conditionally released from the special commitment center.” The
following are considered to be risk potential activities or facilities:
i. Public and private schools;

Facility to provide intensive staffing ratios. In facilities with six or fewer
residents, the facility must provide a ratio of one staff on duty for each
three residents during the night hours (6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.).
ii. Close supervision and escorts. Unless otherwise ordered by the court,
each Secure Community Transition Facility resident must be closely
supervised (on a one-to-one basis) by a trained staff or court- authorized
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐41
escort when the resident leaves the Secure Community Transition
Facility premises for any purpose. The staff/escort must remain with the
resident for the duration of the outing, even when the resident may be
working at a job. Staff and escorts must carry a cellular telephone or a
similar communication device at all times when escorting a resident.
iii. Household security systems. The Secure Community Transition Facility

leave the facility premises only for specified purposes, as authorized by
the court order, and only with prior approval of the resident’s assigned
community corrections officer, treatment provider, and the Secure
Community Transition Facility program manager. Reasons for leaving the
facility may include treatment, employment interviews, employment,
training, and other activities, such as family visits, that are specifically
addressed in the resident’s treatment plan.
vii. Individual electronic monitoring devices. Unless otherwise ordered by the
court, each resident must wear an individual electronic monitoring device.
f. Properties that fail to meet any of these criteria must be removed from further
consideration. The properties that do meet the minimum standards must be
further evaluated to determine which one, among the available properties, is the
most suitable. When a site is selected, preference must be given to properties
that are the farthest removed from risk potential activities or facilities.
g. The use shall be subject to restrictions and conditions as may be imposed by the
Hearing Examiner under Article 10-4H.

Hearing Examiner under Article 10-4H.
10-2C-5 Accessory Structures
Accessory structures are of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use or
structure on the same lot. Typical accessory structures in residential zones include detached garages,
carports, sheds, workshops, green houses, and similar structures, but do not include cargo containers,
which are not permitted. (For standards applicable to Accessory Dwellings, please refer to Section 10-
2C-3). Accessory structures shall comply with all of the following standards and Sections 10-2C-6 for
setbacks and 10-2C-7 for maximum lot coverage:
A. Primary use required. An accessory structure shall only be allowed on lots with another
permitted, limited, or conditional use as defined above, on the same lot.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐43
B. Compliance with land division standards. The owner may be required to remove an accessory
structure as a condition of land division approval when removal of the structure is necessary to
comply with setback standards.
C. Building Height. The height of a detached accessory structure shall not exceed the height of the
primary structure or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater.
D. Buffering. A minimum 6-foot sight obscuring fence shall be required to screen the accessory
structure from dwellings on adjacent lots, unless a similar screen is already provided, the
distance to adjacent dwelling(s) is greater than 50 feet, or the buffer requirement is waived in
acknowledged writing by abutting property owners.
E. Development Standards, Architectural Guidelines, and Design Standards. Accessory structures
must comply with all applicable standards and guidelines for this zone (10-2C-6, 10- 2C-7, 10-
2C-8, 10-2C-9, 10-2C-10, and 10-2C-11), unless specifically exempted, or alternative methods
are authorized, or a variance is approved by the City.
10-2C-6 Development Setbacks
Building setbacks provide space for private yards, and building separation for fire protection/security,
building maintenance, sunlight, and air circulation. This section is also intended to promote humanscale
design and traffic calming by downplaying the visual presence of garages along the street and
encouraging the use of extra-wide sidewalks and pocket parks in front of markets and other nonresidential
uses. The standards encourage placement of residences close to the street for public safety
and neighborhood security.
Building setbacks are the distance between a building (or other feature of development) and a property
line, right-of-way, auto-court lane, or street, as applicable; however, no structures shall be located within
easements. Setbacks for decks and porches are measured from the edge of the deck or porch to the
property line. The setback standards, as listed and illustrated below, apply to primary structures as well
as accessory structures, unless otherwise specified above for Limited or Conditional Uses. A Variance
is required in accordance with Article 10-5B to modify any setback standard. If an existing border
easement is in place, the setback is measured from the back of the border easement, as applicable.

for a range of needed housing, in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
1. The density standards may be averaged over more than one development phase (i.e.,
as in a planned unit development). Duplex and triplex or other multi-family lots used to
comply with the density standard shall be so designated on the final subdivision or short
subdivision plat.
2. The following types of housing categorized under other uses, are exempt from the
density standards: Specialty housing (independent senior, assisted living, nursing home,
convalescent home, Alzheimer's facilities), social service facilities, and bed and
breakfast inns. Additionally, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU's) are exempt due to their
small size and low occupancy level.
B. Maximum Lot Coverage. “Lot Coverage” means all areas of a lot or parcel covered by buildings
(as defined by foundation perimeters) and other structures with surfaces greater than 30 inches
above the finished grade. Compliance with other sections of this code may preclude
development of the maximum lot coverage for some land uses.
C. Restrictions. Structures shall not be placed over an easement that prohibits such placement or

10-2C-8 Building Height
The following building height standards are intended to promote land use compatibility and support the
principle of neighborhood-scale design:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the R-2 Zone shall be no more than 35 feet tall.
Building height may be restricted to less than this maximum when necessary to comply with the
Building Height Transition standard in “C” below.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
building.
Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, roof equipment, flag poles, and
similar features which are not for human occupancy, but may be restricted in height to
protect views. Within residential zones, bell towers, steeples, and similar features are
included within the maximum height and shall conform to the height requirements of the
R-2 zone.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐51
C. Building Height Transition. To provide compatible building scale and privacy between
developments, taller buildings shall “step-down” to create a building height transition to adjacent
single-story building(s).
1. This standard applies to new and vertically expanded buildings within 12 feet (as
measured horizontally) of an existing single-story building with a height of 20 feet or
less, as shown above.
2. The building height transition standard is met when the height of the taller building (“x”)
does not exceed one (1) foot of height for every one (1) foot of side yard separating the
two buildings (“y”), as shown above up to a maximum 10' required side yard setback
adjacent to the single story building.
10-2C-9 Building Orientation
Residential Single Family Attached Townhome or Multi-Family Orientation Example
Non-Residential Orientation Example
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐52
A. Purpose. The following standards are intended to orient buildings close to streets to promote
human-scale development, slow traffic down, and encourage walking in neighborhoods. Placing
residences and other buildings close to the street also encourages security and safety by having
more “eyes-on-the-street”.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the R-2 Zone that require Site Design Review
(see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do not receive
the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical equipment; and
similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the R-2 zone are also required to comply with
the standards outlined above in Section 10-2C-3 or 10-2C-4. Buildings that do not require site
design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Building orientation standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall be oriented
to a street. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2C-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Commercial and
multi-family building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby
entrances, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial
spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a
direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in
accordance with the standards in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. In this case, at
least one entrance shall be provided not more than 30 feet from the closest sidewalk or
street.
3. Off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed between buildings
and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse enclosures shall be
oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent practical and shall not be
placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall be screened with a wall
of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3, subsection H.

E. Development Standards, Architectural Guidelines, and Design Standards. Accessory structures
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐70
must comply with all applicable standards and guidelines for this zone (10-2D-6, 10- 2D-7, 10-
2D-8, 10-2D-9, 10-2D-10, and 10-2D-11), unless specifically exempted, or alternative methods
are authorized, or a variance is approved by the City.
10-2D-6 Development Setbacks
Building setbacks provide space for private yards, and building separation for fire protection/security,
building maintenance, sunlight, and air circulation. This section is also intended to promote humanscale
design and traffic calming by downplaying the visual presence of garages along the street and
encouraging the use of extra-wide sidewalks and pocket parks in front of markets and other nonresidential
uses. The standards encourage placement of residences close to the street for public safety
and neighborhood security.
Building setbacks are measured from perimeter of the structure to the respective property line.
Setbacks for decks and porches are measured from the edge of the deck or porch to the property line.
The setback standards, as listed and illustrated below, apply to primary structures as well as accessory
structures, unless otherwise specified above for Limited or Conditional Uses. A Variance is required in
accordance with Article 10-5B to modify any setback standard. If an existing border easement is in
place, the setback is measured from the back of the border easement.
A. Front Yard Setbacks
1. A minimum setback of 16 feet is required, except that an unenclosed porch may be
within 10 feet, as long as it does not encroach into a public utility easement.
2. Garages and carports shall be accessed from alleys or otherwise recessed behind the
front building elevation by a minimum of 4 feet. Alternatively, garage and carport
entrances may be built flush with the front building elevation when the building is set
back by at least 20 feet.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐71
3. Multi-family housing and other buildings that require Site Design Review (see Section
10-4C-2), shall also comply with the building orientation standards in Section 10-2C-9.
B. Rear YSaertdb acks
1. The minimum rear yard setback shall be 15 feet for street-access lots, and 6 feet for
alley-access lots (except for accessory structures).
2. Accessory structures:
a. Structures 120 square feet or under may be located on the rear and side property
lines, so long as no eave overhangs the property line, the structure is not built
on a permanent foundation, and the abutting property is protected from runoff or
other intrusion.
b. The minimum rear yard setback shall be 5 feet for all other accessory structures
less than 15 feet tall and for accessory structures greater than 15 feet tall, an
additional foot of rear yard setback shall be added per foot of height to a
maximum of 15 feet.
C. Side Yard Setbacks
1. The minimum side yard setback shall be 5 feet on interior side yards and 15 feet on
flanking street yards (street corner yards).
2. When zero-lot line development is permitted, the minimum side yard setbacks shall be
6 feet minimum on one side of the dwelling unit, and no setback required on the
opposite side. (See standards for zero-lot line housing in Section 10-2C-3)
D. Setback Exceptions
The following architectural features are allowed to encroach into the setback yards: Eaves,
chimneys, bay windows, overhangs, and similar architectural features may encroach into
setbacks by no more than 2 feet. Porches, decks and similar structures not exceeding 24 inches
in height may encroach into setbacks by no more than 5 feet, subject to the front yard setback
provisions in “A”. Walls and fences may be placed on property lines, subject to the standards in
Section 10-3C-5 - Landscaping and Fences and Walls. Walls and fences within front yards shall
additionally comply with the vision clearance standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection N.
Interior sideyard setbacks would be 0 feet for dwelling units that are attached by a common
wall.
E. Special Yards - Distance Between Buildings on the Same Lot
To provide usable yard area and allow air circulation and light, the minimum distance between
buildings on the same lot shall be at least 6 feet. This requirement shall also apply to portions
of the same buildings separated from each other by a court, landscaped yard, or other open
space.
10-2D-7 Lot Area, Dimensions, Coverage, & Residential Density
A. Residential Density Standard. The density standards in the following chart shall apply to all new
development. The standards are intended to ensure efficient use of buildable lands and provide
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐72
for a range of needed housing, in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
1. The density standards may be averaged over more than one development phase (i.e.,
as in a planned unit development). Duplex and triplex or other multi-family lots used to
comply with the density standard shall be so designated on the final subdivision or short
subdivision plat.
2. The following types of housing categorized under other uses, are exempt from the
density standards: Specialty housing (independent senior, assisted living, nursing home,
convalescent home, Alzheimer's facilities), social service facilities, and bed and
breakfast inns. Additionally, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU's) are exempt due to their
small size and low occupancy level.
B. Maximum Lot Coverage. “Lot Coverage” means all areas of a lot or parcel covered by buildings
(as defined by foundation perimeters) and other structures with surfaces greater than 30 inches
above the finished grade. Compliance with other sections of this code may preclude
development of the maximum lot coverage for some land uses.
C. Restrictions. Structures shall not be placed over an easement that prohibits such placement or
encroach into the public right-of-way.

10-2D-8 Building Height
The following building height standards are intended to promote land use compatibility and support the
principle of neighborhood-scale design:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the R-3 Zone shall be no more than 35 feet tall.
Building height may be restricted to less than this maximum when necessary to comply with the
Building Height Transition standard in “C” below. Roof equipment and other similar features
visible from a street or I-90 which are necessary to the commercial / industrial operation shall
be screened, and shall not exceed 6 feet in height, which shall be included within the maximum
height. The screen shall consist of a parapet wall or similar aesthetically pleasing architectural
feature, as determined by the Zoning Administrator or designee. Equipment not visible from 5’
above the centerline of the adjoining street will not have to meet screen requirements.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
building.
Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, roof equipment, flag poles, and
similar features which are not for human occupancy, but may be restricted in height to
protect views. Within residential zones, bell towers, steeples, and similar features are
included within the maximum height and shall conform to the height requirements of the
R-3 zone.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐75
C. Building Height Transition. To provide compatible building scale and privacy between
developments, taller buildings shall “step-down” to create a building height transition to adjacent
single-story building(s).
1. This standard applies to new and vertically expanded buildings within 12 feet (as
measured horizontally) of an existing single-story building with a height of 20 feet or
less, as shown above.
2. The building height transition standard is met when the height of the taller building (“x”)
does not exceed one (1) foot of height for every one (1) foot of side yard separating the
two buildings (“y”), as shown above up to a maximum 10' required side yard setback
adjacent to the single story building.
10-2D-9 Building Orientation
Residential Single Family Attached Townhome or Multi-Family Orientation Example
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐76
Non-Residential Orientation Example
A. Purpose. The following standards are intended to orient buildings close to streets to promote
human-scale development, slow traffic down, and encourage walking in neighborhoods. Placing
residences and other buildings close to the street also encourages security and safety by having
more “eyes-on-the-street”.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the R-3 Zone that require Site Design Review
(see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do not receive
the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical equipment; and
similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the R-3 zone are also required to comply with
the standards outlined above in Section 10-2D-3 or 10-2D-4. Buildings that do not require site
design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Building orientation standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall be oriented
to a street. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2D-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Commercial and
multi-family building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby
entrances, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial
spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a
direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in
accordance with the standards in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. In this case, at
least one entrance shall be provided not more than 30 feet from the closest sidewalk or
street.
3. Off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed between buildings
and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse enclosures shall be
oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent practical and shall not be
placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall be screened with a wall
of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3, subsection H.

as in a planned unit development). Multi-family lots used to comply with the density
standard shall be so designated on the final subdivision or short subdivision plat, or final
binding site plan.
2. The following types of housing categorized under other uses, are exempt from the
density standards: Specialty housing (independent senior, assisted living, nursing home,
convalescent home, Alzheimer's facilities), social service facilities, and bed and
breakfast inns. Additionally, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU's) are exempt due to their
small size and low occupancy level.
B. Maximum Lot Coverage. “Lot Coverage” means all areas of a lot or parcel covered by buildings
(as defined by foundation perimeters) and other structures with surfaces greater than 30 inches
above the finished grade. Compliance with other sections of this code may preclude
development of the maximum lot coverage for some land uses.
C. Restrictions. Structures shall not be placed over an easement that prohibits such placement or
encroach into the public right-of-way.

10-2E-8 Building Height
All buildings in the M-1 (Neighborhood Center Mixed-Use) District shall comply with the following
building height standards. The standards are intended to allow for development of appropriately scaled
buildings with a pedestrian friendly character:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the M-1 Zone shall be no more than 35 feet tall. The
maximum height may be increased by 10 feet when housing is provided above the ground floor
(“vertical mixed use”), as shown above. The building height increase for housing shall apply
only to that portion of the building that contains housing. Roof equipment and other similar
features which are necessary to the commercial / industrial operation shall be screened, and
shall not exceed 6 feet in height. The screen shall consist of a parapet wall or similar
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐98
aesthetically pleasing architectural feature, as determined by the Zoning Administrator or
designee. Equipment not visible from 5’ above the centerline of the adjoining street will not have
to meet screen requirements.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
building. Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, bell towers, steeples, roof
equipment, flag poles, and similar features which are not for human occupancy, but may
be restricted in height to protect views.
10-2E-9 Building Orientation
Block Layout Example
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐99
A. Purpose. This section is intended to promote the walkable, pedestrian friendly character of the
M-1 (Neighborhood Center Mixed-Use) District by orienting (placing or locating) buildings close
to streets. Placing buildings close to the street also slows traffic down and provides more “eyes
on the street”, increasing the safety of public spaces. The standards, as listed and illustrated
below, compliment the front yard setback standards in Section 10-2E-6 above.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the M-1 Zone that require Site Design
Review (see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do
not receive the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical
equipment; and similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the M-1 zone are also
required to comply with the standards outlined above in Section 10-2E-3 or 10-2E-4. Buildings
that do not require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Building orientation standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall be oriented
to a street and shall be configured to provide a rear, side, or interior parking area. Pedestrian
pathways shall be provided from the street right-of-way to parking areas between buildings, as
necessary to ensure reasonably safe, direct, and convenient access to building entrances and
off-street parking. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are
met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2E-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Commercial and
multi-family building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby
entrances, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial
spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a
direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in
accordance with the standards in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. At least one
entrance shall be provided not more than 50 feet from the closest sidewalk, street, or
pedestrian path, as depicted in the graphic in Section 10-2E-6 above.
3. Off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed between buildings
and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse enclosures shall be
oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent practical and shall not be
placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall be screened with a wall
of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3, subsection H.

10-2E-10 Architectural Guidelines and Special Standards
A. Purpose. The architectural guidelines are intended to provide detailed, human-scale design,
while affording flexibility to use a variety of building styles.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the M-1 Zone that require Site Design
Review (see Section 10-4C-2). Limited and Conditional Uses within the M-1 zone are also
required to comply with the standards outlined above in Section 10-2E-3 or 10-2E-4. Buildings
that do not require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall comply with all of the following
standards. The graphics provided are intended to show examples of how to comply. Other
building styles and designs can be used to comply, so long as they are consistent with the text
of this section. An architectural feature (i.e., as shown in the graphics) may be used to comply
with more than one standard.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐102
1. Detailed Design.
All buildings shall provide detailed design along the front building elevation (i.e., facing
the street), as applicable. Note: the example shown above is meant to illustrate required
building design elements, and should not be interpreted as a required architectural style.
a. Corner building entrances on corner lots. Alternatively, a building entrance may
be located away from the corner when the building corner is beveled or
incorporates other detailing to reduce the angular appearance of the building at
the street corner. The main entrance(s) to buildings shall be clearly delineated
through architectural design and provide protection for pedestrians.
b. Regularly spaced and similar-shaped windows with window hoods or trim (all
building stories). Buildings that are unable to provide regularly spaced and
similar-shaped windows due to the internal function of the building space (e.g.,
mechanical equipment, manufacturing areas, movie theater viewing areas, light
sensitive laboratories, etc.) or for structural reasons may not be required to meet
this standard; however alternatives to break up blank walls shall be provided.
c. Large display windows on the ground-floor (non-residential uses only). Display
windows shall be framed by bulkheads, piers and a storefront cornice (e.g.,
separates ground-floor from second story, as shown above). Buildings that are
unable to provide large display windows due to the internal function of the
building space (e.g., mechanical equipment, manufacturing areas, movie theater
viewing areas, light sensitive laboratories, etc.) or for structural reasons may not
be required to meet this standard; however alternatives to break up blank walls
shall be provided.
d. Decorative cornice at top of building (flat roof); or eaves provided with pitched
roof.
e. All residential buildings subject to site design review shall also comply with "2"
below.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐103
2. Residential Buildings.
a. The continuous horizontal distance (i.e., as measured from end-wall to end- wall)
of individual buildings shall not exceed 160 feet. All buildings shall incorporate
design features such as offsets, balconies, projections, window reveals, or
similar elements to preclude large expanses of uninterrupted building surfaces,
as shown in the above Figure. Along the vertical face of a structure, such
features shall occur at a minimum of every 40 feet, and on each floor shall
contain at least two of the following features:
i. Recess (e.g., deck, patio, courtyard, entrance or similar feature) that has
a minimum depth of 4 feet;
ii. Extension (e.g., floor area, deck, patio, entrance, or similar feature) that
projects a minimum of 2 feet and runs horizontally for a minimum length
of 4 feet; and/or
iii. Offsets or breaks in roof elevation of 2 feet or greater in height.
b. All building elevations visible from a street right of way shall provide doors,
porches, balconies, and/or windows. A minimum of 50 percent of the front (i.e.,
street-facing) elevation width, and a minimum of 25 percent of the side and rear
building elevation width, as applicable, shall meet this standard. The standard
applies to each full and partial building story.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐104
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐105
c. Residential buildings shall provide detailed design along all elevations (i.e., front,
rear and sides). Detailed design shall be provided by using at least 2 of the
following architectural features on all elevations, as appropriate for the proposed
building type and style (may vary features on rear/side/front elevations):
i. Dormers
ii. Gables
iii. Recessed entries
iv. Covered porch entries
v. Cupolas orto wers
vi. Pillars orp osts

ornamentation, and similar features)
xiii. Decorative cornices and roof lines (e.g., for flat roofs)
xiv. An alternative feature providing visual relief, similar to the above options.
3. Design of Large-Scale Buildings and Developments.
All large-scale buildings and developments shall provide human-scale design by
conforming to the standards in subsections a & b, below. Large-scale buildings and
developments are buildings with greater than 20,000 square feet of enclosed groundfloor
space (i.e., “large-scale”) or multiple-building developments with a combined
ground-floor space (enclosed) greater than 40,000 square feet (e.g., shopping centers,
public/institutional campuses, and similar developments). Multi-tenant buildings shall be
counted as the sum of all tenant spaces within the same building shell.
a. Incorporate changes in building direction (i.e., articulation), and divide large
masses into varying heights and sizes, as shown above. Such changes may
include building offsets; projections; changes in elevation or horizontal direction;
sheltering roofs; terraces; a distinct pattern of divisions in surface materials; and
use of windows, screening trees; small-scale lighting (e.g., wall-mounted lighting,
or up-lighting); and similar features. Note: the example shown below is meant to
illustrate examples of these building design elements, and should not be
interpreted as a required architectural style.
b. Every building elevation adjacent to a street with a horizontal dimension of more
than 100 feet, as measured from end-wall to end-wall, shall have a main building
entrance; except that building elevations that are unable to provide an entrance
due to the internal function of the building space (e.g., mechanical equipment,
areas where the public or employees are not received, etc.) or for structural
reasons may not be required to meet this standard; however alternatives to break
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐106
up blank walls shall be provided. Pathways shall connect all public entrances to
the street right-of-way, in conformance with Article 10- 3B - Access and
Circulation and Section 10-2E-9, subsection C above.
D. Materials & Colors. All proposed building materials should be durable and of good quality and
appropriate to the surroundings. Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant
part of the visual impact of a building. Therefore they should be aesthetically pleasing and
compatible with materials and colors of adjoining buildings and other buildings within the City.

10-2F-6 Development Setbacks
In the M-2 (Community Center Mixed-Use) District, the setback standards are flexible to encourage
public spaces between sidewalks and building entrances (e.g., extra-wide sidewalks, plazas, squares,
outdoor dining areas, and pocket parks). The standards encourage placement of buildings close to the
street to create a vibrant pedestrian environment, to slow traffic down, to provide a storefront character
to the street, and to encourage walking. The standards also encourage the formation of solid blocks of
buildings to create a walkable environment.
Building setbacks are measured from perimeter of the structure to the respective property line.
Setbacks for decks and porches are measured from the edge of the deck or porch to the property line.
The setback standards, as listed below, apply to primary structures as well as accessory structures,
unless otherwise specified above for Limited or Conditional Uses. A Variance is required in accordance
with Article 10-5B to modify any setback standard. If an existing border easement is in place, the
setback is measured from the back of the border easement.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐126
A. Front Yard Setbacks
1. There is no minimum front yard setback required.
2. The maximum allowable front yard setback is 25 feet. This standard is met when a
minimum of 25 percent of the front building elevation is placed no more than 25 feet
back from the front property line, or the back of the border easement, as applicable.
However, no structures shall be constructed within any easements. On parcels with
more than one building, this standard applies to the building located the closest to the
front property line. For developments where more than one building or development pad
is proposed, the building located furthest from the right-of-way shall have no maximum
front yard setback and parking may be located between the buildings furthest from the
right-of-way.
3. The maximum setback may be increased if the increased setback is used for the
following pedestrian or aesthetic amenities associated with the building use (e.g., extrawide
sidewalk, plaza, pocket park, outdoor dining area, courtyard, etc. or additional front
yard landscaping).
B. Rear YSaertdb acks
1. The minimum rear yard setback shall be 5 feet for street-access lots, and 8 feet for alleyaccess
lots (distance from building to rear property line or alley easement) in order to
provide space for parallel parking (except for accessory structures).
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐127
2. Accessory structures:
a. Structures 120 square feet or under may be located on the rear and side property
lines, so long as no eave overhangs the property line, the structure is not built
on a permanent foundation, and the abutting property is protected from runoff or
other intrusion.
b. The minimum rear yard setback shall be 5 feet for all other accessory structures
less than 15 feet tall and for accessory structures greater than 15 feet tall, an
additional foot of rear yard setback shall be added per foot of height to a
maximum of 15 feet.
3. For buildings on through-lots (lots with front and rear frontage onto a street), the front
yard setbacks in “A” shall apply.
C. Side Yard Setbacks
There is no minimum side yard setback required, except that buildings shall conform to the
vision clearance standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection N, and the applicable fire and
building codes for attached structures, fire walls, and related requirements.
D. Setback Exceptions
Eaves, chimneys, bay windows, overhangs, cornices, awnings, canopies, porches, decks,
pergolas, and similar architectural features may encroach into setbacks by no more than 5 feet,
subject to compliance with applicable standards of the Building Code and Fire Code. Walls and
fences may be placed on property lines, subject to the standards in Section 10- 3C-5 -
Landscaping and Fences and Walls. Walls and fences within front yards shall additionally
comply with the vision clearance standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection N. The Zoning
Administrator has the discretion to allow an increase in the maximum setback for public safety
facility access.
E. Special Yards - Distance Between Buildings on the Same Lot
To provide usable yard area and allow air circulation and light, the minimum distance between
buildings on the same lot shall be at least 6 feet. This requirement shall also apply to portions
of the same buildings separated from each other by a court, landscaped yard, or other open
space.
10-2F-7 Lot Area, Dimensions, Coverage, & Residential Density
A. Residential Density Standard. The density standards in the following chart shall apply to all new
development. The standards are intended to ensure efficient use of buildable lands and provide
for a range of needed housing, in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
1. The density standards may be averaged over more than one development phase (i.e.,
as in a planned unit development). Multi-family lots used to comply with the density
standard shall be so designated on the final subdivision or short subdivision plat, or final
binding site plan.
2. The following types of housing categorized under other uses, are exempt from the
density standards: Specialty housing (independent senior, assisted living, nursing home,
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐128
convalescent home, Alzheimer's facilities), social service facilities, and bed and
breakfast inns. Additionally, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU's) are exempt due to their
small size and low occupancy level.
B. Maximum Lot Coverage. “Lot Coverage” means all areas of a lot or parcel covered by buildings
(as defined by foundation perimeters) and other structures with surfaces greater than 30 inches
above the finished grade. Compliance with other sections of this code may preclude
development of the maximum lot coverage for some land uses.
C. Restrictions. Structures shall not be placed over an easement that prohibits such placement or
encroach into the public right-of-way.
D. Exception. The minimum net density standards above may not apply when physical constraints
(e.g., topography) prevent construction in conformance with the standards, as determined by
the Zoning Administrator.

10-2F-8 Building Height
All buildings in the M-2 (Community Center Mixed-Use) District shall comply with the following building
height standards. The standards are intended to allow for development of appropriately- scaled
buildings with a pedestrian friendly character:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the M-2 Zone shall be no more than 50 feet tall. The
maximum height may be increased by 10 feet when residential housing is provided above the
ground floor (“vertical mixed use”), as shown above. The building height increase for housing
shall apply only to that portion of the building that contains housing. Roof equipment and other
similar features which are necessary to the commercial / industrial operation shall be screened,
and shall not exceed 6 feet in height, which shall be included within the maximum height. The
screen shall consist of a parapet wall or similar aesthetically pleasing architectural feature, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator or designee. Equipment not visible from 5’ above the
centerline of the adjoining street will not have to meet screen requirements.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐130
building. Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, bell towers, steeples, roof
equipment, flag poles, and similar features which are not for human occupancy, but may
be restricted in height to protect views.
10-2F-9 Building Orientation
A. Purpose. This section is intended to promote the walkable, pedestrian friendly character of the
M-2 (Community Center Mixed-Use) District by orienting (placing or locating) buildings close to
streets. Placing buildings close to the street also slows traffic down and provides more “eyes on
the street”, increasing the safety of public spaces. The standards, as listed and illustrated below,
compliment the front yard setback standards in Section 10-2F-6 above.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the M-2 Zone that require Site Design
Review (see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do
not receive the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical
equipment; and similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the M-2 zone are also
required to comply with the standards outlined above in Section 10-2F-3 or 10-2F-4. Buildings
that do not require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Building orientation standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall be oriented
to a street and shall be configured to provide a rear, side, or interior parking area. Pedestrian
pathways shall be provided from the street right-of-way to parking areas between buildings, as
necessary to ensure reasonably safe, direct, and convenient access to building entrances and
off-street parking. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are
met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2F-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Commercial and
multi-family building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby
entrances, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial
spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a
direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in
accordance with the standards in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. At least one
entrance shall be provided not more than 50 feet from the closest sidewalk, street, or
pedestrian path, as depicted in the graphic in Section 10-2F-6 above.
3. Off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed between buildings
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐131
and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse enclosures shall be
oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent practical and shall not be
placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall be screened with a wall
of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3, subsection H.
4. On corner lots, buildings and their entrances shall be oriented to the street corner,
whenever possible; parking, driveways, and other vehicle areas shall be prohibited
between buildings and street corners.

smaller buildings (less than 50,000 gross square feet) are located between the
large-scale retail establishment and the street
b. Outparcels with non large-scale retail establishments must be located between
large-scale retail establishments and an arterial or collector street.
c. Access & Traffic
i. Large-scale retail establishments must have at least two approaches with
the main approach located on an arterial or collector street;
ii. Vehicle access must be designed to accommodate peak traffic volumes;
iii. Site layout must provide access connections to adjacent parcels / uses;
and
iv. Off-street parking, drives, and other vehicular areas cannot be placed
between buildings and streets, if prohibited by the Development Code for
the zone.
D. Variances. These standards shall not be changed through a Variance. The Zoning Administrator
may allow the standard to be varied from to address topographic or other physical constraints.

projects a minimum of 2 feet and runs horizontally for a minimum length
of 4 feet; and/or
iii. Offsets or breaks in roof elevation of 2 feet or greater in height.
b. All building elevations visible from a street right of way shall provide doors,
porches, balconies, and/or windows. A minimum of 50 percent of the front (i.e.,
street-facing) elevation width, and a minimum of 25 percent of the side and rear
building elevation width, as applicable, shall meet this standard. The standard
applies to each full and partial building story.
c. Residential buildings shall provide detailed design along all elevations (i.e., front,
rear and sides). Detailed design shall be provided by using at least 2 of the
following architectural features on all elevations, as appropriate for the proposed
building type and style (may vary features on rear/side/front elevations):

3. Design of Large-Scale Buildings and Developments.
All large-scale buildings and developments shall provide human-scale design by
conforming to the standards in subsections a & b, below. Large-scale buildings and
developments are buildings with greater than 20,000 square feet of enclosed groundfloor
space (i.e., “large-scale”) or multiple-building developments with a combined
ground-floor space (enclosed) greater than 40,000 square feet (e.g., shopping centers,
public/institutional campuses, and similar developments). Multi-tenant buildings shall be
counted as the sum of all tenant spaces within the same building shell.
a. Incorporate changes in building direction (i.e., articulation), and divide large
masses into varying heights and sizes, as shown above. Such changes may
include building offsets; projections; changes in elevation or horizontal direction;
sheltering roofs; terraces; a distinct pattern of divisions in surface materials; and
use of windows, screening trees; small-scale lighting (e.g., wall-mounted lighting,
or up-lighting); and similar features. Note: the example shown below is meant to
illustrate examples of these building design elements, and should not be
interpreted as a required architectural style.
b. Every building elevation adjacent to a street with a horizontal dimension of more
than 100 feet, as measured from end-wall to end-wall, shall have a main building
entrance; except that building elevations that are unable to provide an entrance
due to the internal function of the building space (e.g., mechanical equipment,
areas where the public or employees are not received, etc.) or for structural
reasons may not be required to meet this standard; however alternatives to break
up blank walls shall be provided. Pathways shall connect all public entrances to

10-2G-5 Accessory Structures
Accessory structures are of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use or
structure on the same lot. Typical accessory structures in mixed use zones include detached garages,
carports, sheds, workshops, green houses, and similar structures, but do not include cargo containers,
which are not permitted. (For standards applicable to Accessory Dwellings, please refer to Section 10-
2G-3). Accessory structures shall comply with all of the following standards and Sections 10-2G-6 for
setbacks and 10-2G-7 for maximum lot coverage:
A. Primary use required. An accessory structure shall only be allowed on lots with another
permitted, limited, or conditional use as defined above, on the same lot.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐158
B. Compliance with land division standards. The owner may be required to remove an accessory
structure as a condition of land division approval when removal of the structure is necessary
to comply with setback standards.
C. Building Height. The height of a detached accessory structure shall not exceed the height of
the primary structure or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater.
D. Buffering. A minimum 6-foot sight-obscuring fence shall be required to screen the accessory
structure from dwellings on adjacent lots, unless a similar screen is already provided, the
distance to adjacent dwelling(s) is greater than 50 feet, or the buffer requirement is waived in
acknowledged writing by abutting property owners.
E. Development Standards, Architectural Guidelines, and Design Standards. Accessory
structures must comply with all applicable standards and guidelines for this zone (10-2G-6, 10-
2G-7, 10-2G-8, 10-2G-9, 10-2G-10, 10-2G-11, and 10-2G-12), unless specifically exempted,
or alternative methods are authorized, or a variance is approved by the City.
10-2G-6 Development Setbacks
In the M-3 (Central Business District Mixed-Use) District, the setback standards are flexible to
encourage public spaces between sidewalks and building entrances (e.g., extra-wide sidewalks,
plazas, squares, outdoor dining areas, and pocket parks). The standards encourage placement of
buildings close to the street to create a vibrant pedestrian environment, to slow traffic down, to provide
a storefront character to the street, and to encourage walking. The standards also encourage the
formation of solid blocks of buildings to create a walkable environment.
Building setbacks are measured from perimeter of the structure to the respective property line.
Setbacks for decks and porches are measured from the edge of the deck or porch to the property line.
The setback standards, as listed below, apply to primary structures as well as accessory structures,
unless otherwise specified above for Limited or Conditional Uses. A Variance is required in accordance
with Article 10-5B to modify any setback standard. If an existing border easement is in place, the
setback is measured from the back of the border easement.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐159
A. Front Yard Setbacks
1. There is no minimum front yard setback required.
2. The maximum allowable front yard setback is 25 feet. This standard is met when a
minimum of 25 percent of the front building elevation is placed no more than 25 feet
back from the front property line, or the back of the border easement, as applicable.
However, no structures shall be constructed within any easements. On parcels with
more than one building, this standard applies to the building located the closest to the
front property line. For developments where more than one building or development
pad is proposed, the building located furthest from the right-of-way shall have no
maximum front yard setback and parking may be located between the buildings furthest
from the right-of-way.
3. The maximum setback may be increased if the increased setback is used for the
following pedestrian or aesthetic amenities associated with the building use (e.g., extrawide
sidewalk, plaza, pocket park, outdoor dining area, courtyard, etc. or additional
front yard landscaping).
B. Rear YSaertdb acks
1. The minimum rear yard setback shall be 5 feet for street-access lots, and 8 feet for
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐160
alley-access lots (distance from building to rear property line or alley easement) in order
to provide space for parallel parking (except for accessory structures).
2. Accessory structures:
i. Structures 120 square feet or under may be located on the rear and side
property lines, so long as no eave overhangs the property line, the
structure is not built on a permanent foundation, and the abutting
property is protected from runoff or other intrusion.
ii. The minimum rear yard setback shall be 5 feet for all other accessory
structures less than 15 feet tall and for accessory structures greater than
15 feet tall, an additional foot of rear yard setback shall be added per
foot of height to a maximum of 15 feet.
3. For buildings on through-lots (lots with front and rear frontage onto a street), the front
yard setbacks in “A” shall apply.
C. Side Yard Setbacks
There is no minimum side yard setback required, except that buildings shall conform to the
vision clearance standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection N, and the applicable fire and
building codes for attached structures, fire walls, and related requirements.
D. Setback Exceptions
Eaves, chimneys, bay windows, overhangs, cornices, awnings, canopies, porches, decks,
pergolas, and similar architectural features may encroach into setbacks by no more than 5 feet,
subject to compliance with applicable standards of the Building Code and Fire Code. Walls and
fences may be placed on property lines, subject to the standards in Section 10-3C-5 -
Landscaping and Fences and Walls. Walls and fences within front yards shall additionally
comply with the vision clearance standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection N. The Zoning
Administrator has the discretion to allow an increase in the maximum setback for public safety
facility access.
E. Special Yards - Distance Between Buildings on the Same Lot
To provide usable yard area and allow air circulation and light, the minimum distance between
buildings on the same lot shall be at least 6 feet. This requirement shall also apply to portions
of the same buildings separated from each other by a court, landscaped yard, or other open
space.
10-2G-7 Lot Area, Dimensions, Coverage, & Residential Density
A. Residential Density Standard. The density standards in the following chart shall apply to all new
development. The standards are intended to ensure efficient use of buildable lands and provide
for a range of needed housing, in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
1. The density standards may be averaged over more than one development phase (i.e.,
as in a planned unit development). Multi-family lots used to comply with the density
standard shall be so designated on the final subdivision or short subdivision plat, or
final binding site plan.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐161
2. The following types of housing categorized under other uses, are exempt from the
density standards: Specialty housing (independent senior, assisted living, nursing
home, convalescent home, Alzheimer's facilities), social service facilities, and bed and
breakfast inns. Additionally, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU's) are exempt due to their
small size and low occupancy level.
B. Maximum Lot Coverage. “Lot Coverage” means all areas of a lot or parcel covered by buildings
(as defined by foundation perimeters) and other structures with surfaces greater than 30 inches
above the finished grade. Compliance with other sections of this code may preclude
development of the maximum lot coverage for some land uses.
C. Restrictions. Structures shall not be placed over an easement that prohibits such placement or
encroach into the public right-of-way.

10-2G-8 Building Height
All buildings in the M-3 (Central Business District Mixed-Use) District shall comply with the following
building height standards. The standards are intended to allow for development of appropriately scaled
buildings with a pedestrian friendly character:
A. Building Height Standard. Buildings within the M-3 Zone shall be no more than 50 feet tall. The
maximum height may be increased by 10 feet when residential housing is provided above the
ground floor (“vertical mixed use”), as shown above. The building height increase for housing
shall apply only to that portion of the building that contains housing. Roof equipment and other
similar features which are necessary to the commercial / industrial operation shall be screened,
and shall not exceed 6 feet in height, which shall be included within the maximum height. The
screen shall consist of a parapet wall or similar aesthetically pleasing architectural feature, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator or designee. Equipment not visible from 5’ above the
centerline of the adjoining street will not have to meet screen requirements.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐163
building. Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, bell towers, steeples, roof
equipment, flag poles, and similar features which are not for human occupancy, but
may be restricted in height to protect views.
10-2G-9 Building Orientation
Block Layout Example
A. Purpose. This section is intended to promote the walkable, pedestrian friendly character of the
M-3 (Central Business District Mixed-Use) District by orienting (placing or locating) buildings
close to streets. Placing buildings close to the street also slows traffic down and provides more
“eyes on the street”, increasing the safety of public spaces. The standards, as listed and
illustrated below, compliment the front yard setback standards in Section 10-2G-6 above.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the M-3 Zone that require Site Design
Review (see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do
not receive the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical
equipment; and similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the M-3 zone are also
required to comply with the standards outlined above in Section 10-2G-3 or 10-2G-4. Buildings
that do not require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Building orientation standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall be oriented
to a street and shall be configured to provide a rear, side, or interior parking area. Pedestrian
pathways shall be provided from the street right-of-way to parking areas between buildings, as
necessary to ensure reasonably safe, direct, and convenient access to building entrances and
off-street parking. The building orientation standard is met when all of the following criteria are
met:
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2G-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to the street. Commercial and
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐164
multi-family building entrances may include entrances to individual units, lobby
entrances, or breezeway/courtyard entrances (i.e., to a cluster of units or commercial
spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a
direct pedestrian walkway is provided between the building entrance and the street in
accordance with the standards in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. At least one
entrance shall be provided not more than 50 feet from the closest sidewalk, street, or
pedestrian path, as depicted in the graphic in Section 10-2E-6 above.
3. Off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed between buildings
and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse enclosures shall be
oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent practical and shall not be
placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall be screened with a wall
of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3, subsection H.
4. On corner lots, buildings and their entrances shall be oriented to the street corner,
whenever possible; parking, driveways and other vehicle areas shall be prohibited
between buildings and street corners.

April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐165
5. Large-scale retail establishments
a. Large-scale retail establishments shall not be located on corner lots, unless
smaller buildings (less than 50,000 gross square feet) are located between the
large-scale retail establishment and the street
b. Outparcels with non large-scale retail establishments must be located between
large-scale retail establishments and an arterial or collector street.
c. Access & Traffic
i. Large-scale retail establishments must have at least two approaches
with the main approach located on an arterial or collector street;
ii. Vehicle access must be designed to accommodate peak traffic volumes;
iii. Site layout must provide access connections to adjacent parcels / uses;
and
iv. Off-street parking, drives, and other vehicular areas cannot be placed
between buildings and streets, if prohibited by the Development Code
for the zone.
D. Variances. These standards shall not be changed through a Variance. The Zoning
Administrator may allow the standard to be varied from to address topographic or other
physical constraints.
10-2G-10 Architectural Guidelines and Special Standards
A. Purpose. The architectural guidelines are intended to provide detailed, human-scale design,
while affording flexibility to use a variety of building styles.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the M-3 Zone that require Site Design

be located away from the corner when the building corner is beveled or
incorporates other detailing to reduce the angular appearance of the building at
the street corner. The main entrance(s) to buildings shall be clearly delineated
through architectural design and provide protection for pedestrians.
b. Regularly spaced and similar-shaped windows with window hoods or trim (all
building stories). Buildings that are unable to provide regularly spaced and
similar-shaped windows due to the internal function of the building space (e.g.,
mechanical equipment, manufacturing areas, movie theater viewing areas, light
sensitive laboratories, etc.) or for structural reasons may not be required to meet
this standard; however alternatives to break up blank walls shall be provided.
c. Large display windows on the ground-floor (non-residential uses only). Display
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐167
windows shall be framed by bulkheads, piers and a storefront cornice (e.g.,
separates ground-floor from second story, as shown above). Buildings that are
unable to provide large display windows due to the internal function of the
building space (e.g., mechanical equipment, manufacturing areas, movie theater
viewing areas, light sensitive laboratories, etc.) or for structural reasons may not
be required to meet this standard; however alternatives to break up blank walls
shall be provided.
d. Decorative cornice at top of building (flat roof); or eaves provided with pitched
roof.
e. All residential buildings subject to site design review shall also comply with "2"
below.
2. Residential Buildings.
a. The continuous horizontal distance (i.e., as measured from end-wall to endwall)
of individual buildings shall not exceed 160 feet. All buildings shall
incorporate design features such as offsets, balconies, projections, window
reveals, or similar elements to preclude large expanses of uninterrupted
building surfaces, as shown in the above Figure. Along the vertical face of a
structure, such features shall occur at a minimum of every 40 feet, and on each
floor shall contain at least two of the following features:
i. Recess (e.g., deck, patio, courtyard, entrance or similar feature) that
has a minimum depth of 4 feet;
ii. Extension (e.g., floor area, deck, patio, entrance, or similar feature) that
projects a minimum of 2 feet and runs horizontally for a minimum length
of 4 feet; and/or
iii. Offsets or breaks in roof elevation of 2 feet or greater in height.
b. All building elevations visible from a street right of way shall provide doors,
porches, balconies, and/or windows. A minimum of 50 percent of the front (i.e.,
street-facing) elevation width, and a minimum of 25 percent of the side and
rear building elevation width, as applicable, shall meet this standard. The
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐168
standard applies to each full and partial building story.
c. Residential buildings shall provide detailed design along all elevations (i.e.,
front, rear and sides). Detailed design shall be provided by using at least 2 of
the following architectural features on all elevations, as appropriate for the
proposed building type and style (may vary features on rear/side/front
elevations):

options.
3. Design of Large-Scale Buildings and Developments.
All large-scale buildings and developments shall provide human-scale design by
conforming to the standards in subsections a & b, below. Large-scale buildings and
developments are buildings with greater than 20,000 square feet of enclosed groundfloor
space (i.e., “large-scale”) or multiple-building developments with a combined
ground-floor space (enclosed) greater than 40,000 square feet (e.g., shopping centers,
public/institutional campuses, and similar developments). Multi-tenant buildings shall
be counted as the sum of all tenant spaces within the same building shell.
a. Incorporate changes in building direction (i.e., articulation), and divide large
masses into varying heights and sizes, as shown above. Such changes may
include building offsets; projections; changes in elevation or horizontal
direction; sheltering roofs; terraces; a distinct pattern of divisions in surface
materials; and use of windows, screening trees; small-scale lighting (e.g., wallmounted
lighting, or up-lighting); and similar features. Note: the example
shown below is meant to illustrate examples of these building design elements,
and should not be interpreted as a required architectural style.
b. Every building elevation adjacent to a street with a horizontal dimension of more
than 100 feet, as measured from end-wall to end-wall, shall have a main building
entrance; except that building elevations that are unable to provide an entrance
due to the internal function of the building space (e.g., mechanical equipment,
areas where the public or employees are not received, etc.) or for structural
reasons may not be required to meet this standard; however alternatives to
break up blank walls shall be provided. Pathways shall connect all public
entrances to the street right-of-way, in conformance with Article 10-3B - Access

All buildings shall provide detailed design along the front building elevation (i.e., facing
the street), as applicable. Note: the example shown above is meant to illustrate required
building design elements, and should not be interpreted as a required architectural style.
a. Incorporate architectural features such as windows, pedestrian entrances,
building off-sets, projections, detailing, change in materials or similar features, to
break up and articulate large building surfaces and volumes.
b. Corner building entrances on corner lots. A building entrance may be located
away from the corner when the building corner is beveled or incorporates other
detailing to reduce the angular appearance of the building at the street corner.
The main entrance(s) to buildings shall be clearly delineated through
architectural design.
c. Pedestrian-scale building entrances. Recessed entries, canopies, and/or similar
features shall be used at the entries to buildings in order to create a pedestrianscale.

All large-scale buildings and developments shall provide human-scale design by
conforming to the standards in subsections a & b, below. Large-scale buildings and
developments are buildings with greater than 20,000 square feet of enclosed groundfloor
space (i.e., “large-scale”) or multiple-building developments with a combined
ground-floor space (enclosed) greater than 40,000 square feet (e.g., shopping centers,
public/institutional campuses, and similar developments). Multi-tenant buildings shall be
counted as the sum of all tenant spaces within the same building shell.
a. Incorporate changes in building direction (i.e., articulation), and divide large
masses into varying heights and sizes, as shown above. Such changes may
include building offsets; projections; changes in elevation or horizontal direction;
sheltering roofs; terraces; a distinct pattern of divisions in surface materials; and
use of windows, screening trees; small-scale lighting (e.g., wall-mounted lighting,
or up-lighting); and similar features. Note: the example shown above is meant to
illustrate examples of these building design elements, and should not be
interpreted as a required architectural style.

b. Every building elevation adjacent to a street with a horizontal dimension of more
than 100 feet, as measured from end-wall to end-wall, shall have a main building
entrance; except that building elevations that are unable to provide an entrance
due to the internal function of the building space (e.g., mechanical equipment,
areas where the public or employees are not received, etc.) or for structural
reasons may not be required to meet this standard; however alternatives to break
up blank walls shall be provided. Pathways shall connect all public entrances to
the street right-of-way, in conformance with Article 10- 3B - Access and
Circulation.
D. Materials & Colors. All proposed building materials should be durable and of good quality and

(see Section 10-4C-2). Limited and Conditional Uses within the P zone are also required to
comply with the standards outlined above in Section 10-2K-3 or 10-2K-4. Buildings that do not
require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
C. Standards. All buildings which are subject to this Section shall comply with all of the following
standards. The graphics provided are intended to show examples of how to comply. Other
building styles and designs can be used to comply, so long as they are consistent with the text
of this section.
1. Detailed Design.
All buildings shall provide detailed design along the front building elevation (i.e., facing
the street), as applicable. Note: the example shown above is meant to illustrate required
building design elements, and should not be interpreted as a required architectural style.
a. Incorporate architectural features such as windows, pedestrian entrances,
building off-sets, projections, detailing, change in materials or similar features, to
break up and articulate large building surfaces and volumes.
b. Corner building entrances on corner lots. A building entrance may be located
away from the corner when the building corner is beveled or incorporates other
detailing to reduce the angular appearance of the building at the street corner.
c. Pedestrian-scale building entrances. Recessed entries, canopies, and/or similar
features shall be used at the entries to buildings in order to create a pedestrianscale.
2. Design of Large-Scale Buildings and Developments.
All large-scale buildings and developments shall provide human-scale design by
conforming to the standards in subsections a & b, below. Large-scale buildings and
developments are buildings with greater than 20,000 square feet of enclosed groundApril

floor space (i.e., “large-scale”) or multiple-building developments with a combined
ground-floor space (enclosed) greater than 40,000 square feet (e.g., shopping centers,
public/institutional campuses, and similar developments). Multi-tenant buildings shall be
counted as the sum of all tenant spaces within the same building shell.
a. Incorporate changes in building direction (i.e., articulation), and divide large
masses into varying heights and sizes, as shown above. Such changes may
include building offsets; projections; changes in elevation or horizontal direction;
sheltering roofs; terraces; a distinct pattern of divisions in surface materials; and
use of windows, screening trees; small-scale lighting (e.g., wall-mounted lighting,
or up-lighting); and similar features. Note: the example shown above is meant to
illustrate examples of these building design elements, and should not be
interpreted as a required architectural style.
b. Every building elevation adjacent to a street with a horizontal dimension of more
than 100 feet, as measured from end-wall to end-wall, shall have a building
entrance; except that building elevations that are unable to provide an entrance
due to the internal function of the building space (e.g., mechanical equipment,
areas where the public or employees are not received, etc.) may not be required
to meet this standard. Pathways shall connect all entrances to the street rightof-
way, in conformance with Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation.
D. Materials & Colors. All proposed building materials should be durable and of good quality and
appropriate to the surroundings. Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant
part of the visual impact of a building. Therefore they should be aesthetically pleasing and
compatible with materials and colors of adjoining buildings and other buildings within the City.

screened, and shall not exceed 6 feet in height. The screen shall consist of a parapet wall or
similar aesthetically pleasing architectural feature, as determined by the Zoning Administrator
or designee. Equipment not visible from 5’ above the centerline of the adjoining street will not
have to meet screen requirements.
B. Method of Measurement. “Building height” is measured as the vertical distance above a
reference datum measured to the highest point of the roof. The reference datum shall be
selected by either of the following, whichever yields a greater height of building (see above
examples):
1. The elevation of the highest adjoining sidewalk or ground surface within a five-foot
horizontal distance of an exterior wall of the building when such sidewalk or ground
surface is not more than 10 feet above the lowest grade;
2. An elevation 10 feet higher than the lowest grade when the sidewalk or ground surface
described in subsection ‘1’ above is more than 10 feet above the lowest grade. The
height of a stepped or terraced building is the maximum height of any segment of the
building. Not included in the maximum height are: chimneys, bell towers, steeples, roof
equipment, flag poles, and similar features which are not for human occupancy, but may
be restricted in height to protect views.
10-2L-9 Building Orientation
A. Purpose. All of the following standards shall apply to new development within the O Zone in
order to reinforce streets as public spaces, encourage alternative modes of transportation, such
as walking, bicycling, and transit use, and promote the preservation of open space.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the O Zone that require Site Design Review
(see Section 10-4C-2), except that the standard shall not apply to buildings which do not receive
the public (e.g., buildings used solely for storage or for housing mechanical equipment; and
similar uses). Limited and Conditional Uses within the P zone are also required to comply with
the standards outlined above in Section 10-2L-3 or 10-2L-4. Buildings that do not require site
design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.

to a street and shall be configured to provide the majority of the parking in a rear, side, or interior
parking area. Pedestrian pathways shall be provided from the street right-of-way to parking
areas between buildings, as necessary to ensure reasonably safe, direct, and convenient
access to building entrances and off-street parking. The building orientation standard is met
when all of the following criteria are met:
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐246
1. Compliance with the setback standards in Section 10-2L-6.
2. All buildings shall have their primary entrance(s) oriented to a street. Alternatively, a
building may have its entrance oriented to a side yard when a direct pedestrian walkway
is provided between the building entrance and the street in accordance with the
standards in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. In this case, at least one entrance
shall be provided not more than 30 feet from the closest sidewalk or street.
3. The majority of the off-street parking, drives, or other vehicle areas shall not be placed
between buildings and streets, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. Refuse
enclosures shall be oriented away from adjacent structures to the greatest extent
practical and shall not be placed between buildings and streets. Refuse enclosures shall
be screened with a wall of not less than 6 feet in height, as outlined in Section 10-3C-3,
subsection H.
4. On corner lots, buildings and their entrances shall be oriented to the street corner,
whenever possible and parking, driveways and other vehicle areas should not be placed
between buildings and street corners.
5. Preservation of open space shall be considered when locating buildings.
D. Variances. These standards shall not be changed through a Variance. The Zoning Administrator
may allow the standard to be varied from to address topographic or other physical constraints.
10-2L-10 Architectural Guidelines and Special Standards
A. Purpose. The architectural guidelines are intended to provide detailed, human-scale design,
while affording flexibility to use a variety of building styles.
B. Applicability. This section applies to all buildings in the O Zone that require Site Design Review
(see Section 10-4C-2). Limited and Conditional Uses within the O zone are also required to

10-2M-1 Purpose
10-2M-2 Specific Area Plan Maps
10-2M-3 Specific Area Plan Text
10-2M-4 Criteria for Establishing Specific Area Plan Districts
10-2M-5 Specific Area Plan Overlay Districts Adopted
10-2M-1 Purpose
Specific area plan overlay districts (“specific plans”) describe in more detail the type of development
planned for a specific area than is typically found in a comprehensive plan or zone map. The area
covered by a specific plan can include multiple parcels and land owners, or a single large parcel. Some
of the characteristics of specific plans are:
A. Designation of site specific land uses (e.g., for individual parcels);
B. Design standards or a development style specific to a geographic area (e.g., Transit Oriented
Development);
C. Detailed description of public facilities needed to serve development;
D. The plan is adopted through a consensus-based process involving property owners;
E. Streamlined development review for projects that are part of the plan; and
F. May include intergovernmental agreements and complimentary zoning for sites that cross
jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., between city and county).
Specific plans usually focus on some unique feature of the site, such as natural resources, economic
activity, or desired neighborhood character. Specific plans may be used for large undeveloped areas,
or partially developed areas with potential for infill and redevelopment.
Specific plans do not require phasing or a timeframe for development, and an application for future
development (i.e., subdivision and/or site plan) need not accompany the application for specific plan
approval. However, all land use applications for property within the specific plan area are required to
comply with the specific area plan overlay districts policies and regulations.
10-2M-2 Specific Area Plan Maps
Specific Area Plan Overlay District ordinances shall include the following plan maps:
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐250
A. Boundary Map. A boundary map shall be prepared for every Specific Area Plan Overlay District.
The boundary map (i.e., based on parcel boundaries or other surveyed boundaries) shall be
used to delineate areas of the district that lie within the city’s boundaries on the official zoning
map. The zoning map shall identify such areas as “SAP”, and reference the applicable specific
area plan ordinance.
B. Specific Area Plan Map. A Specific Area Plan Map shall designate the land use types and
intensities permitted within the overlay district. The plan shall identify areas for the following
land uses, as applicable:
1. Residential
2. Commercial
3. Industrial
4. Mixed use
5. Open Space
6. Other
The plan shall identify sufficient area for any needed parks, schools, libraries and other public
and facilities based on the City’s Comprehensive Plan and other applicable policies and plans.
C. Conceptual Development Plan. The Specific Area Plan shall provide a conceptual development
plan, with maps indicating the following features:
1. Blocks. A map with the general location and configuration of all blocks (i.e., areas bounded
by streets).
2. Residential Land Use. A map with proposed residential densities, permitted housing types,
and general lot patterns. Specific lot patterns shall be refined during land division approval.
3. Transportation Plan. A transportation plan map shall indicate future street connections to
existing streets, and connections within the plan area. At a minimum, the plan shall indicate
the general alignment of collector and arterial streets, and potential local access street
connections. Final street alignments and design shall be subject to final engineering
approvals. The plan shall also indicate the location of bicycle, pedestrian, and transit
improvements that are necessary to serve the area, in conformance with Article 10-3B and
10-3G.
4. Preliminary Grading and Utilities Plan. The preliminary grading and utilities plan shall
indicate the extent of grading (i.e., cuts and fills) and the general alignment and sizing of
major utility lines necessary to serve the area, including sanitary sewer, water, and storm
drainage. Actual utility alignments and design shall be subject to engineering approvals
through the land division and/or site design review process.
10-2M-3 Specific Area Plan Text
Specific Area Plan Overlay District ordinances shall set forth the following provisions and standards:
A. Name and Purpose of Overlay District. This section shall describe the overlay district in sufficient
detail as to clarify the purpose and intent of the overlay district regulations.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐251
B. Implementation. This section shall describe the required land use application process for
development within the overlay district, including any modifications to the procedures in Chapter
4 (e.g., Type I or Type II application versus Type III, etc.). This section shall also reference
intergovernmental agreements that apply to the plan area (i.e., when part of the plan area lies
outside of the City, within an unincorporated area).
C. Land Use & Development Standards. This section shall specify the City Development Code
requirements that will be applicable or tailored to the SAP (based on Ch.1, Ch.2, Ch.3, and
Ch.6). The existing zones contained within the SAP overlay area shall be identified and an
itemized list of proposed modifications to each of the items listed below shall be included at the
beginning of this section. Please compare proposed changes to existing zoning standards. The
standards proposed to be used for the SAP Overlay shall apply to the entire project duration,
unless an amendment is proposed, as described in Section 10-2M-6 below. Subsequent
changes to the City Development Code after the SAP Overlay proposal is approved shall not
apply to the project.
1. Definitions. Specify any definitions not included in the City Development Code or that
will differ from the City Development Code for the SAP.
2. Land Uses. Identify permitted and prohibited land uses, and uses with special
requirements or review procedures (i.e., site design review, conditional use, etc.).
3. Accessory Structures. Identify whether or not accessory structures will be permitted and
if they are permitted, what the height and other standards will be.
4. Development Setbacks. Identify required building setbacks for front, side, rear, and
flanking yards, as well as setback exceptions and special yards, as applicable.
5. Lot Area, Dimensions, Coverage, & Residential Density. Identify minimum / maximum
lot area, minimum / maximum lot width & depth, minimum lot coverage, and minimum /
maximum residential density, as applicable.
6. Building Height. Identify the building height standards and method of measurement.
7. Building Orientation. Identify the building orientation standards for interior and corner
lots, as well as specific use, as applicable.
8. Architectural Guidelines and Special Standards. Identify the overall detailed design and
human scale components as well as components for specific uses, along with permitted
/ prohibited building materials (roof, siding, and detailing) and permitted / prohibited
colors, as applicable.
9. Pedestrian and Transit Amenities. Identify the pedestrian and transit amenities that will
be incorporated into the SAP site and/or specific buildings, as applicable.
10. Identify any portion of the SAP that is proposed to be different from the requirements of
Chapter 3 (i.e. parking, landscaping, lighting standards, etc.), as applicable.
11. Identify if any portion of the site contains Critical Areas and any SAP standards that are
proposed to be different from the requirements of Chapter 6, as applicable.
The criteria in Section 10-2M-4 shall be used in creating land use and development standards.
D. Additional Information
1. All SAP applications must include an analysis of the number of dwelling units permitted
under the original (pre-SAP) zoning. Although it is not possible to compute a concrete,
single figure, this analysis will make estimates, based on reasonable assumptions about
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐252
open space percentage, street coverage percentage, etc.
2. All SAP applications must include a binding minimum and maximum number of dwelling
units that the SAP will include. These numbers may be higher or lower than the number
of dwelling units contemplated under the original zoning.
3. All SAP applications must include the proposed amount of open space (i.e. maintained
parks, natural areas, etc.)
10-2M-4 Criteria for Establishing Specific Area Plan Overlay Districts
The adoption of the Specific Area Plan Overlay District ordinance shall conform to the following
standards and procedures:
A. Comprehensive Plan Amendment and/or Zoning District Change Required. Specific Area Plan
Overlay Districts are adopted by ordinance as an amendment to both the Comprehensive Plan
and Chapter 2 (Zoning Districts) of this code; except that only a zoning district change shall be
required when the specific area plan is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Specific area
plans that cover unincorporated areas within the UGA shall also require amendment to Spokane
County’s Comprehensive Plan and/or Zoning and shall comply with the Countywide Planning
Policies for joint planning.
B. Specific Area Plan Overlay District Criteria. Specific Area Plan Overlay Districts shall meet the
following minimum standards for adoption, in addition to the amendment criteria in Article 10-
4F:
1. Specific Area. The overlay district is necessary to provide land use or development
standards tailored to a specific geographic area and development program, that cannot
otherwise be provided through conventional zoning.
2. Land Use Compatibility. The overlay district provides equal or greater compatibility with
surrounding land uses than what would likely occur with conventional zoning.
3. Critical Areas. The overlay district provides equal or greater protection to critical areas
than what would likely occur with conventional zoning.
4. Efficient Land Use. The overlay district promotes efficient land use by allowing housing
and commercial development at densities that are equal to or greater than the densities
that would be allowed with conventional zoning. The overlay district may provide for
density transfers or transferable development rights as a method of providing efficient
land use while protecting critical areas.
5. Land Use and Transportation Relationship. The overlay district provides equal or greater
opportunities for alternative modes of transportation (e.g., walking, bicycling, transit)
than what would likely occur with conventional zoning by:
a. encouraging or requiring mixed use development where applicable;
b. providing a master plan with direct and convenient pedestrian and bicycle
connections between all land uses; and
c. providing for transit service where applicable.
6. Design Standards. The design standards of Chapters 2 and 3 shall apply to all
development, unless the SAP provides development design standards (see 10-2M-3C
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 2 Page 2‐253
above) that are equal to or greater than the standards that would be required with
conventional zoning (e.g., building orientation, parking, open space, architectural
guidelines, etc.). Development standards specified in the SAP ordinance are binding,
and take precedence over standards in Chapter 2 or 3.

Article 10-3A — Design Standards Administration
Sections:
10-3A-1 Applicability
10-3A-2 Types of Design Standards
10-3A-1 Applicability
All developments within the City must comply with the provisions of Chapter 3, as well as the article
within Chapter 2 for the zone the development is located. Some developments, such as major projects
requiring land division and/or site design review approval, may require detailed findings demonstrating
compliance with each chapter of the code. For smaller, less complex projects, fewer code provisions
may apply.
10-3A-2 Types of Design Standards
The City’s development design standards are contained in both Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. It is important
to review both chapters, and all relevant code sections within the chapters, to determine which
standards apply. The City may prepare checklists to assist property owners and applicants in
determining which sections apply.
A. Chapter 3. The design standards contained within the following articles apply throughout the
City, for all land use types:
1. Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation
2. Article 10-3C - Landscaping, Street Trees, Fences and Walls
3. Article 10-3D - Vehicle and Bicycle Parking
4. Article 10-3E - Signage Standards
5. Article 10-3F - Other Design Standards
6. Article 10-3G - Public Facilities Standards
7. Article 10-3H - Stormwater Management
8. Article 10-3I - Property Maintenance Standards
B. Chapter 2. Each zoning district (Chapter 2) provides design standards that are specifically
tailored to the zoning district. For example, the R-1 (Single Family Residential) District contains
building design guidelines that are different than those provided in the M-1 (Neighborhood
Center Mixed-Use) District, due to differences in land use, building types, and compatibility
issues. In addition, each district provides special standards that are meant to address the
impacts or characteristics of certain land uses.

Article 10-3B — Access and Circulation
Sections:
10-3B-1 Purpose
10-3B-2 Vehicular Access and Circulation
10-3B-3 Pedestrian Access and Circulation
10-3B-1 Purpose
The purpose of this article is to ensure that developments provide safe and efficient access and
circulation, for pedestrians and vehicles. Section 10-3B-2 provides standards for vehicular access and
circulation. Section 10-3B-3 provides standards for pedestrian access and circulation. Standards for
transportation improvements are provided in Article 10-3G.
10-3B-2 Vehicular Access and Circulation
A. Intent and Purpose. The intent of this article is to manage vehicle access to development
through a connected street system, while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety,
roadway capacity, and efficiency. Access shall be managed to maintain an adequate “level of
service” and to maintain the “functional classification” of roadways, as required by the City’s
Transportation Improvement Program. Major roadways, including arterials and collectors, serve
as the primary system for moving people and goods. “Access management” is a primary
concern on these roads. Local access streets and driveways provide access to individual
properties. Alleys can provide secondary access to properties. If vehicular access and
circulation are not properly designed, these roadways will be unable to accommodate the needs
of development and serve their transportation function. This article attempts to balance the right
of reasonable access to private property with the right of all citizens. It also requires all
developments to construct planned streets (arterials and collectors) and to extend local access
streets. Also see Article 10-3G.
To achieve this policy intent, roadways have been categorized in the Comprehensive Plan by
function and classified for access purposes based upon their level of importance and function,
(see Article 10-3G). Regulations have been applied to these roadways for the purpose of
reducing traffic accidents, personal injury, and property damage attributable to access systems,
and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network. This will protect the
substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for
expensive remedial measures. These regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land,
protect community character, and conserve natural resources by promoting well-designed road
and access systems and preventing the unplanned subdivision of land.
B. Applicability. This article shall apply to all vehicular access and traffic circulation within the City
and to all abutting properties.
C. Approach Permit Required. Access to a public street requires an Approach Permit in
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-4
accordance with the following procedures:
1. Permits for access to City streets shall be subject to review and approval by the City
Engineer based on the standards contained in this article, the provisions of Article 10-
3G, and other applicable City Engineering Design Standards. An approach permit may
be in the form of a permit issued by the City or it may be attached to a land use decision
notice as a condition of approval.
2. Permits for access to State highways shall be subject to review and approval by
Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT).
D. Traffic Study Requirements. The City or other agency with access jurisdiction may require a
traffic study prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed in the State of Washington
to determine access, circulation and other transportation requirements or participation in an
established traffic mitigation plan shall be required. (See also, Article 10-3G)
E. Conditions of Approval. The City may, in the case of new development along arterial or collector
streets, require the closing or consolidation of existing curb cuts or other vehicle access points,
recording of reciprocal access easements (i.e., for shared driveways), development of a
frontage street, installation of traffic control devices, and/or other mitigation as a condition of
granting an approach permit. Access to and from off-street parking areas shall not permit
backing onto a public street, except in Residential Zones.
F. Access Options. When vehicle access is required for development (i.e., for off-street parking,
delivery, service, drive-through facilities, etc.), access shall be provided by one of the following
methods (a minimum of 10 feet per lane is required). These methods are “options” to the
developer/subdivider, unless one method is specifically required by Chapter 2 (i.e., under
“Limited or Conditional Uses”).
1. Option 1. Access is from a private street or driveway connected to an adjoining property
that has direct access to a public street (i.e., “shared driveway”). A public access
easement covering the driveway shall be recorded in this case to assure access to the
closest public street for all users of the private street/drive.
2. Option 2. Access is from a public street adjacent to the development parcel. If practical,
the owner/developer may be required to close or consolidate an existing access point
as a condition of approving a new access. Street accesses shall comply with the access
spacing standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection Section G, below.
3. Subdivisions Fronting Onto an Arterial Street. New residential land divisions fronting
onto an arterial street shall be required to provide alleys or secondary (local or collector)
streets for access to individual lots. When alleys or secondary streets cannot be
constructed due to topographic or other physical constraints, access may be provided
by consolidating driveways for clusters of two or more lots.
4. Double-Frontage Lots. When a lot has frontage onto two or more streets, access shall
be provided first from the street with the lowest classification. For example, access shall
be provided from a local street before a collector or arterial street. Except for corner lots,
the creation of new double-frontage lots shall be prohibited in Residential Zones, unless
topographic or physical constraints require the formation of such lots. When doublefrontage
lots are permitted in Residential Zones, a landscape buffer with trees and/or
shrubs and ground cover not less than 20 feet wide shall be provided between the back
yard fence/wall and the sidewalk or street; maintenance shall be assured by the owner
(i.e., through homeowner’s association, etc.).
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-5
Important cross-references to other code sections:
Chapters 2 and 3 may require buildings placed at or near the front property line and driveways
and parking areas oriented to the side or rear yard. The City may require the dedication of public
right-of-way and construction of a street (e.g., frontage road, alley or other street) when the
development impact is proportionate to the need for such a street, and the street is identified by
the Comprehensive Plan or an adopted Transportation Plan. (Please refer to Article 10-3G)
G. Access Spacing. Driveway accesses shall be separated from other driveways and street
intersections in accordance with the following standards and procedures:
1. Local Access Streets. A minimum of 50 feet separation between driveways and a
minimum of 150 feet between intersections (as measured from the edge of the driveway
/ intersection) shall be required on local access streets (i.e., streets not designated as
collectors or arterials), except as provided in subsection 3, below or unless a shared
driveway, as outlined in Section 10-3B-2, subsection "I" below, is utilized. Single family,
two-family, and three-family uses may not be required to comply with the 50 foot
minimum separation, however compliance with Section 10-3B-2, subsection "K" below
shall be required.
a. Exception. If existing parcel configuration prevents required access spacing or
shared approaches, the access spacing may be reduced, as determined by the
Zoning Administrator.
2. Arterial and Collector Streets. Access spacing on collector and arterial streets, and at
controlled intersections (i.e., with four-way stop sign or traffic signal) shall be determined
based on the policies and standards contained in the City’s Transportation Improvement
Plan and applicable Engineering Design standards. A minimum of 300 feet separation
between driveways shall be required on arterial streets and a minimum of 150 feet
separation between driveways shall be required on collector streets. A minimum of 300
feet separation between intersections on arterial and collector streets shall be required.
a. The City may require additional separation between driveways or intersections
on arterials and collectors designated as Aesthetic Corridors / Boulevards on the
City Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map to allow for landscaped medians,
consistent with street design and traffic safety standards.
b. Exception. If existing parcel configuration prevents required access spacing or
shared approaches, the access spacing may be reduced, as determined by the
Zoning Administrator / Designee. The City also has the discretion to allow a
decrease in the access spacing for public safety.
3. Special Provisions for All Streets. Direct street access may be restricted for some land
uses, in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 2 - Zoning Districts. For example,
access consolidation, shared access, and/or access separation greater than that
specified by subsections 1 and 2, may be required by the City, County, or WSDOT for
the purpose of protecting the function, safety, and operation of the street for all users
(see Section 10-3B-2, subsection ‘I’, below). Where no other alternatives exist, the
permitting agency may allow construction of an access connection along the property
line farthest from an intersection. In such cases, directional connections (i.e., right in/out,
right in only, or right out only) may be required.
H. Number of Access Points. For all housing types, except multi-family, one street access point is
permitted per lot, when alley access cannot otherwise be provided; except that two access
points may be permitted for housing on corner lots (i.e., no more than one access per street),
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-6
subject to the access spacing standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection ‘G’, above. The number
of street access points for multiple family, commercial, industrial, and public/institutional
developments shall be minimized to protect the function, safety, and operation of the street(s)
and sidewalk(s) for all users. Shared access may be required, in conformance with Section 10-
3B-2, subsection 'I', below, in order to maintain the required access spacing, and minimize the
number of access points.
I. Shared Driveways. Except for single family residential, the City shall require shared driveways
as a condition of land division or site design review, as applicable and feasible, for traffic safety
and access management purposes in accordance with the following standards:
1. Shared driveways and frontage streets may be required to consolidate access onto a
collector or arterial street. When shared driveways or frontage streets are required, they
shall be stubbed to adjacent developable parcels to indicate future extension. “Stub”
means that a driveway or street temporarily ends at the property line, but may be
extended in the future as the adjacent parcel develops. “Developable” means that a
parcel is either vacant or it is likely to receive additional development (i.e., due to infill or
redevelopment potential).
2. Access easements (i.e., for the benefit of affected properties) shall be recorded for all
shared driveways, including pathways, at the time of final plat approval (Article 10-4D)
or as a condition of site development approval (Article 10-4C).
3. Exception. Shared driveways are not required when existing development patterns or
physical constraints (e.g., topography, parcel configuration, and similar conditions)
prevent extending the street/driveway in the future.
J. Street Connectivity and Formation of Blocks Required. In order to promote efficient vehicular
and pedestrian circulation throughout the city, land divisions and large site developments shall
produce complete blocks bounded by a connecting network of public and/or private streets, in
accordance with the following standards:
1. Block Length and Perimeter. The maximum block length and perimeter shall not exceed:
600 feet length and 1,600 feet perimeter in Residential and Mixed Use Zones.
2. Street Standards. Public and private streets shall also conform to Article 10-3G, Section
10-3B-3 - Pedestrian Access and Circulation, and applicable Americans With Disabilities
Act (ADA) design standards.
3. Exception. Exceptions to the above standards may be granted when blocks are divided
by one or more pathway(s), in conformance with the provisions of Section 10-3B-3.
Pathways shall be located to minimize out-of-direction travel by pedestrians and may be
designed to accommodate bicycles. The block length and perimeter standards may not
apply when existing development patterns or physical constraints (e.g., topography,
parcel configuration, and similar conditions) prevent construction in conformance with
the standards If a single use requires a parcel larger than the block formation allows, an
exception may be granted.
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-7
K. Driveway Openings. Driveway openings or curb cuts shall be the minimum width necessary to
provide the required number of vehicle travel lanes and shall comply with the City of Liberty
Lake Engineering Design Standards. The following standards (i.e., as measured where the front
property line meets the sidewalk or right-of-way) are required to provide adequate site access,
minimize stormwater runoff, and avoid conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. Approach
width may be increased if it is necessary to provide for shared driveways or public safety, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator or designee:
1. Single family, two-family, and three-family uses shall have a minimum driveway width of
10 feet, and a maximum width of 30 feet
2. Multiple family uses with between 4 and 7 dwelling units shall have a minimum driveway
width of 20 feet, and a maximum width of 30 feet.
3. Multiple family uses with more than 8 dwelling units, and off-street parking areas with 16
or more parking spaces, shall have a minimum driveway width of 24 feet, and a
maximum width of 30 feet. These dimensions may be increased if the Zoning
Administrator determines that more than two lanes are required based on the number
of trips generated or the need for turning lanes.
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-8
4. Driveway widths for all other uses shall not exceed 35 feet, except that driveways
providing direct access to parking spaces shall conform to the parking area standards in
Article 10-3D, or unless approved by the City.
5. Driveway Aprons. Driveway aprons (when required) shall be constructed of concrete
and shall be installed between the street right-of-way and the private drive, as shown
above. Driveway aprons shall conform to ADA standards for sidewalks and pathways.
Examples of Acceptable Driveway Openings Next to Sidewalks/Pathways
L. Fire Access and Parking Area Turn-Arounds. A fire equipment access drive shall be provided
in accordance with the Building and Fire Codes. Parking areas shall provide adequate aisles or
turn-around areas for service and delivery vehicles so that all vehicles may enter the street in a
forward manner.
M. Vertical Clearances. Driveways, private streets, aisles, turn-around areas, and ramps shall have
a minimum vertical clearance of 13' 6” for their entire length and width.
N. Vision Clearance. No signs or structures, or vegetation in excess of three feet in height shall be
placed in “vision clearance areas” or "clear view triangle", as described and shown below. The
minimum vision clearance area may be increased by the City Engineer upon finding that more
sight distance is required (i.e., due to traffic speeds, roadway alignment, etc.). Vision clearance
standards shall be based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) standards. The following examples are based on a typical situation;
however project designers shall be responsible for designing the proposed project to AASHTO
Standards. If the project designer does not have access to this AASHTO guide, the City
Engineer will assist them with determining requirements for the clear view triangle.
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-9
O. Construction. The following development and maintenance standards shall apply to all
driveways and private streets:
1. Surface Options. Driveways, parking areas, aisles, and turn-arounds may be paved with
asphalt, concrete or comparable surfacing, or a durable non-paving material may be
used to reduce stormwater runoff and protect water quality. Paving surfaces shall be
subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. In no case shall graveled surfaces
be used.
2. Stormwater Management. When a paved surface is used, all driveways, parking areas,
aisles, and turn-arounds shall have on-site collection or infiltration of surface waters to
eliminate sheet flow of such waters onto public rights-of-way and abutting property.
Stormwater facilities shall be constructed in conformance with City Engineering Design
Standards.
3. Driveway Aprons. When driveway approaches or “aprons” are required to connect
driveways to the public right-of-way, they shall be paved with concrete surfacing. (See
also, Section 10-3B-2, subsection 'K' above and the City Engineering Design
Standards.)
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-10
10-3B-3 Pedestrian Access and Circulation
Pedestrian Pathway System for Multifamily Development (Typical)
A. Pedestrian Access and Circulation. To ensure safe, direct, and convenient pedestrian
circulation, all developments shall provide a continuous pedestrian and/or multi-use pathway
system. (Pathways only provide for pedestrian circulation. Multi-use pathways accommodate
pedestrians and bicycles.) The system of pathways shall be designed based on the standards
in subsections 1-4, below:
1. Continuous Pathways. The pathway system shall extend throughout the development
site, and connect to all future phases of development, adjacent trails, public parks, and
open space areas whenever possible. The developer may also be required to connect
or stub pathway(s) to adjacent streets and private property, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10-3B-2 - Vehicular Access and Circulation, and Article 10-3G.
2. Safe, Direct, and Convenient Pathways. Pathways within developments shall provide
safe, reasonably direct, and convenient connections between primary building entrances
and all adjacent streets, based on the following definitions:
a. Reasonably direct. A route that does not deviate unnecessarily or a route that
does not involve a significant amount of out-of-direction travel for likely users.
b. Safe and convenient. Bicycle and pedestrian routes that are reasonably free from
hazards and provide a reasonably direct route of travel between destinations.
c. For commercial, industrial, mixed use, public, and institutional buildings, the
“primary entrance” is the main public entrance to the building. In the case where
no public entrance exists, street connections shall be provided to the main
employee entrance.
d. For residential buildings the “primary entrance” is the front door (i.e., facing the
street). For multifamily buildings in which each unit does not have its own exterior
entrance, the “primary entrance” may be a lobby, courtyard, or breezeway which
serves as a common entrance for more than one dwelling.
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-11
3. Connections Within Development. For all developments subject to Site Design Review,
pathways shall connect all building entrances to one another. In addition, pathways shall
connect all parking areas, storage areas, recreational facilities, and common areas (as
applicable), and adjacent developments to the site, as applicable.
4. Street Connectivity. Pathways (for pedestrians and bicycles) shall be provided at or near
mid-block where the block length exceeds the length required by Section 10-3B- 2,
subsection 'J'. Pathways shall also be provided where cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets
are planned, to connect the ends of the streets together, to other streets, and/or to other
developments, as applicable. Pathways used to comply with these standards shall
conform to all of the following criteria:
a. Multi-use or shared pathways (i.e., for pedestrians and bicyclists) are no less
than 10 feet wide and located within a 20-foot-wide right-of-way or easement that
allows access for emergency vehicles;
b. If the streets within the subdivision or neighborhood are lighted, the pathways
shall also be lighted;
c. Stairs or switchback paths using a narrower right-of-way/easement may be
required in lieu of a multi-use pathway where grades are steep;
d. The City may require landscaping within the pathway easement/right-of-way for
screening and the privacy of adjoining properties;
e. The City Engineer may determine that a pathway is impractical due to: physical
or topographic conditions (e.g., freeways, railroads, extremely steep slopes,
critical areas, and similar physical constraints); buildings or other existing
development on adjacent properties that physically prevent a connection now or
in the future, considering the potential for redevelopment; and sites where the
provisions of recorded leases, easements, covenants, restrictions, or other
agreements recorded as of the effective date of this Code prohibit the pathway
connection.
Pathway Standards (Typical)
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-12
B. Design and Construction. Pathways shall conform to all of the standards in 1-5 below:
1. Vehicle/Pathway Separation. Where pathways are parallel and adjacent to a driveway
or street (public or private), they shall be raised 6 inches and curbed, or separated from
the driveway/street by a 5-foot minimum strip with bollards, a landscape berm, or other
physical barrier. If a raised path is used, the ends of the raised portions must be
equipped with curb ramps. This standard may not apply to re-construction of existing
roadways.
2. Housing/Pathway Separation. Pedestrian pathways shall be separated a minimum of 5
feet from all residential living areas on the ground-floor, except at building entrances.
Separation is measured as measured from the pathway edge to the closest dwelling
unit. The separation area shall be landscaped in conformance with the provisions of
Article 10-3C. No pathway/building separation is required for commercial, industrial,
public, or institutional uses.
3. Crosswalks. Where pathways cross a parking area, driveway, or street (“crosswalk”),
they shall be clearly marked with contrasting paving materials, humps/raised crossings,
or painted striping. An example of contrasting paving material is the use of a concrete
crosswalk through an asphalt driveway. If painted striping is used, it shall consist of
thermo-plastic striping or similar type of durable application. Crosswalks within parking
areas may be removed at the discretion of the City Engineer.
4. Sidewalk & Pathway Surface. Sidewalks shall be concrete and at least 6' wide, unless
otherwise specified by this Code. Pathway surfaces shall be concrete, asphalt, brick/
masonry pavers, or other durable surface, at least 10 feet wide. (See also the applicable
City Transportation Standards related to pathways). Additionally, sidewalk and pathway
design shall conform to the requirements of Section 10-3G-2 - Transportation
Improvements, the City Engineering Design Standards, the Liberty Lake Trail System
Plan and Parks, Recreation, Open Space, and Trails Plan, as applicable.
5. Accessible routes. Pathways shall comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act,
which requires accessible routes of travel.

Article 10-3C — Landscaping, Street Trees, Fences, and Walls
Sections:
10-3C-1 Purpose
10-3C-2 Landscape Conservation
10-3C-3 New Landscaping
10-3C-4 Street Trees
10-3C-5 Fences and Walls
10-3C-1 Purpose
The purpose of this article is to promote community health, safety and welfare by protecting natural
vegetation, and setting development standards for landscaping, street trees, fences and walls.
Together, these elements of the natural and built environment maintain and protect property values,
enhance the City’s appearance and character, visually unify the City and its neighborhoods, and
promote proper plant selection and provide for continuous maintenance so that plant materials can
flourish. Trees provide climate control through shading during summer months and wind screening
during winter, and trees and other plants can also buffer pedestrians from traffic. Walls, fences, trees
and other landscape materials also provide vital screening and buffering between land uses.
Landscaped areas help to control stormwater drainage and can improve water quality, as compared to
paved or built surfaces. The article is organized into the following sections:
A. 10-3C-2 Landscape Conservation - prevents the indiscriminate removal of significant trees
and other vegetation, including vegetation associated with streams, wetlands and other
protected natural resource and critical areas.
B. 10-3C-3 New Landscaping - sets standards for and requires site landscaping and buffering for
parking and maneuvering areas, and between different zones. (Note that other landscaping
standards may be provided in Chapter 2 - Zoning Districts, for specific types of development.)
C. 10-3C-4 Street Trees - sets standards for and requires planting of trees along all streets for
shading, comfort, and aesthetic purposes.
D. 10-3C-5 Fences and Walls - sets standards for new fences and walls, including maximum
allowable height and materials, to promote security, personal safety, privacy, and aesthetics.
(Note that other fence and wall standards may be provided in Chapter 2 - Zoning Districts, for
specific types of development.)
10-3C-2 Landscape Conservation
A. Applicability. All development sites containing Significant Vegetation, as defined below, shall
comply with the standards of this Section. The purpose of this Section is to incorporate
significant native vegetation into the landscapes of development and protect vegetation
associated with streams, wetlands and other protected natural resource and critical areas. The
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-14
use of mature, native vegetation within developments is a preferred alternative to removal of
vegetation and re-planting. Mature landscaping provides summer shade and wind breaks, and
allows for water conservation due to larger plants having established root systems.
B. Significant Vegetation.
1. Significant Trees and Shrubs - All trees within the public right of way with a trunk
diameter of 12 inches or greater, as measured 4 feet above the ground (DBH), and all
plants within the drip line of such trees and shrubs, shall be protected, if practical and
as applicable. Additionally, individual trees and shrubs with a trunk diameter of 12 inches
or greater should be protected, if practical. Other trees may be deemed significant, when
nominated by the property owner or City staff and designated by the City Council as
“Heritage Trees” (i.e., by virtue of site, rarity, historical significance, etc.)
2. Natural Resource / Critical Areas - Trees and shrubs on sites that have been designated
as “Critical Areas” or natural resource areas, in accordance with Chapter 6 (e.g., due to
slope, natural resource areas, wildlife habitat, etc.) shall be protected.
3. Exception - Protection shall not be required for plants listed as non-native, Class A
weeds by the Spokane County Noxious Weed Control Board or for non-native invasive
plants.
C. Mapping and Protection Required. All significant trees within the right of way and all Heritage
Trees shall be mapped individually and identified by species and size (diameter at 4 feet above
grade, or “DBH”). A “protection” area shall be defined around the edge of all branches (drip-line)
of each tree (drip lines may overlap between trees). The City also may require an inventory,
survey, or assessment prepared by a qualified professional when necessary to determine
vegetation boundaries, building setbacks, and other protection or mitigation requirements. Other
significant vegetation should be identified as existing vegetation on required landscape plans
with their size and species, if the trees will be preserved as a portion of the required landscaping.
D. Protection Standards. All of the following protection standards shall apply to significant
vegetation identified in B above, other vegetation should comply whenever practical:
1. Protection of Significant Vegetation - Significant vegetation shall be retained whenever
practical, as determined by the City. Preservation may become impractical when it would
prevent reasonable development of public streets, utilities, or land uses permitted by the
applicable zoning district and relocation of the vegetation or replacement with equivalent
vegetation with the closest DBH for trees or commercially available nursery size
available in the Spokane/ Coeur d’Alene metro region shall be required within the
development or if not possible, then relocated or replaced within another area in the
City.
2. Protection of Natural Resource / Critical Areas - Natural Resource / Critical Areas shall
be protected in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 6.
3. Conservation Easements and Dedications - When necessary to implement the
Comprehensive Plan, the City may require dedication of land or recordation of a
conservation easement to protect specific areas, including groves of significant trees or
Heritage Trees.
E. Construction. All areas of significant vegetation shall be protected prior to, during, and after
construction. Grading and operation of vehicles and heavy equipment is prohibited within
significant vegetation areas, except as approved by the City for installation of utilities or streets.
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-15
Such approval shall only be granted after finding that there is no other reasonable alternative to
avoid the protected area, and any required mitigation is provided in conformance with Chapter 6
and Subsection D above.

Article 10-3D — Vehicle and Bicycle Parking
Sections:
10-3D-1 Purpose
10-3D-2 Applicability
10-3D-3 Vehicle Parking Standards
10-3D-4 Bicycle Parking Standards
10-3D-5 Loading Space Standards
10-3D-1 Purpose
The purpose of this article is to provide basic and flexible standards for development of vehicle and
bicycle parking. The design of parking areas is critically important to the viability of some commercial
areas, pedestrian and driver safety, the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets, and community
image and livability. Historically, some communities have required more parking than is necessary for
some land uses, paving extensive areas of land that could be put to better use. Because vehicle parking
facilities can occupy large amounts of land, they must be planned and designed carefully to use the
land efficiently while maintaining the visual character of the community. This article recognizes that
each development has unique parking needs by providing a flexible approach for determining parking
space requirements (i.e., “minimum” and “performance-based” standards). This article also provides
standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation, commuting, and
general transportation. Children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles
throughout the community.
10-3D-2 Applicability
All new development shall comply with the provisions of this article.
10-3D-3 Vehicle Parking Standards
A. Vehicle Parking Minimum Standards. The number of required off-street vehicle parking spaces
shall be determined in accordance with the following standards. Off-street parking spaces may
include spaces in garages, carports, parking lots, and/or driveways if vehicles are not parked in
a vehicle travel lane (including emergency or fire access lanes), public right-of- way, pathway,
or landscape area. The City encourages locating parking lots to the rear or side of buildings to
enhance streetscapes and promote pedestrian access. Required parking spaces shall be
calculated for primary and accessory uses.

City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-29
C. Unspecified Uses. Where a use is not specifically listed in subsection "A" above, parking
requirements shall be determined by finding that a use is similar to those listed in terms of
parking needs or by utilizing the ITE Parking Manual. For all non-residential uses or for special
cases involving new residential developments, the required minimum parking amount shall be
determined by the City. For determination by the City, the Applicant shall supply:
1. Documentation regarding actual parking demand for the proposed use; or
2. Technical studies relating the parking need for the proposed use; or
3. Required parking for the proposed use as determined by other comparable jurisdictions.
D. Credit for On-Street Parking. The amount of off-street parking required may be reduced by one
off-street parking space for every on-street parking space provided adjacent to the development
in the Mixed Use Zones. The following constitutes an on-street parking space (stalls shall meet
minimum dimension requirements in section "E" below, except for aisle width which shall
conform to the City of Liberty Lake Right of Way and Street Design Standards for motor vehicle
travel lanes (see Article 10-3G):
1. 0 degree / parallel parking;
2. 30 degree diagonal parking;
3. 45 degree diagonal parking;
4. 60 degree diagonal parking;
5. 90 degree (perpendicular) parking;
6. Curb space must be connected to the lot which contains the use;
7. Parking spaces that would not obstruct a required clear vision area, nor any other
parking that violates any law or street standard; and
8. On-street parking spaces credited for a specific use may not be used exclusively by that
use, but shall be available for general public use at all times. Signs or actions limiting
general public use of on-street spaces is prohibited.
E. Credit for Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking may substitute for up to ten percent of required
parking. For every five non-required bicycle parking spaces that meet the short or long-term
bicycle parking standards, the motor vehicle parking requirement is reduced by one space.
Existing parking may be converted to take advantage of this provision.
F. Change of Use. When a change in the use of a building or site is proposed, the Applicant must
provide documentation for City review and approval demonstrating how the parking
requirements for the proposal will be met. This may include, the provision of additional onsite
parking, shared parking, credit for on-street parking and/or a variance, in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
G. Parking Stall Standard Dimensions and Compact Car Parking. All parking stalls shall be
improved to conform to City standards for surfacing, stormwater management, and striping, and
provide dimensions in accordance with the following table. Up to 15% of the required parking
may be designed and labeled as compact. Compact stalls are 1’ narrower and 2’ shorter than
standard stalls (i.e. a 9’ x 18’ standard stall would be a 8’ x 16’ compact stall). Compact stalls
shall include landscape islands as required by Article 10-3C of this Code, except they can be 9’

City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-31
the parking area to the use shall be measured from the nearest parking space to a
building entrance, following a sidewalk or other pedestrian route. The right to use the
off-site parking must be evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, easement, or similar
written instrument.
3. Mixed uses. If more than one type of land use occupies a single structure or parcel of
land, the total requirements for off-street automobile parking shall be the sum of the
requirements for all uses, unless it can be shown that the peak parking demands are
actually less (i.e., the uses operate on different days or at different times of the day). In
that case, the total requirements shall be reduced accordingly.
4. Shared parking. Required parking facilities for two or more uses, structures, or parcels
of land may be satisfied by the same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that the
owners or operators show that the need for parking facilities does not materially overlap
(e.g., uses primarily of a daytime versus nighttime nature), and provided that the right of
joint use is evidenced by a recorded deed, lease, contract, or similar written instrument
establishing the joint use. The required parking in the Light Industrial (I) Zone
classification can be reduced by 30% where parking facilities for 2 or more uses,
structures or parcels of land are shared by a recorded instrument establishing joint use
and access.
5. Availability of facilities. Owners of off-street parking facilities may post a sign indicating
that all parking on the site is available only for residents, customers and/or employees,
as applicable. Signs shall conform to the standards of Article 10-3E.

10-3D-4 Bicycle Parking Standards
All uses which are subject to Site Design Review (see Section 10-4C-2) shall provide bicycle parking,
in conformance with the following guidelines, which are evaluated during Site Design Review. Buildings
that do not require site design review are encouraged to incorporate these standards.
A. Number of Bicycle Parking Spaces. Unless specified in 1-7 below, at least one bicycle parking
space shall be supplied per 50 required vehicle parking spaces with a minimum of 2 spaces
provided. Generally, a bike rack(s) would be installed that have the capacity to accommodate
the required number of spaces. Providing sheltered spaces (under an eave, overhang,
independent structure, or similar cover) is encouraged.
The following additional standards apply to specific types of development:
1. Multi-Family Residences.
Provide one bicycle parking space for every unit (structures with 4 or more units).
2. Parking Structures and Park & Ride Facilities.
All parking structures shall provide a minimum of one bicycle parking space for every
10 motor vehicle parking spaces.
3. Elementary and middle schools, both private and public.
Provide one bicycle parking space for every 10 students that the school is designed to
accommodate.
4. High schools, both private and public.
Provide one bicycle parking space for every 20 students that the school is designed to
accommodate.
5. Colleges and trade schools.
Provide one bicycle parking space for every 10 motor vehicle spaces plus one space for
every dormitory unit.
6. Mixed Use Zones.
Within the M-1, M-2, and M-3 zones, individual businesses shall provide their own
bicycle parking, or spaces may be clustered between businesses to serve up to six (6)
bicycles. One bicycle parking space shall be provided per 25 required vehicle spaces
with a minimum of 5 spaces provided. Bicycle parking spaces should be located in front
of the businesses, either on the sidewalks or in specially constructed areas such as
pedestrian curb extensions. Inverted "U" style racks are recommended. Bicycle parking
shall not interfere with pedestrian passage, leaving a clear area of at least 36 inches
between bicycles and other existing and potential obstructions.
7. Multiple Uses.
For buildings with multiple uses (such as a commercial or mixed use center), bicycle
parking standards shall be calculated by using the total number of motor vehicle parking
spaces required for the entire development. One bicycle parking space per 25 motor
vehicle parking spaces is recommended, with a minimum of 5 spaces.
B. Exemptions. This section does not apply to single family, two-family, and three-family housing
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-33
(attached, detached or manufactured housing), home occupations, accessory dwelling units, or
other developments with fewer than 10 required vehicle parking spaces.
C. Location and Design. Bicycle parking shall be conveniently located with respect to both the
street right-of-way and at least one building entrance (e.g., no farther away than the closest
parking space). It should be incorporated whenever possible into building design and
coordinated with the design of street furniture when it is provided. Street furniture includes
benches, street lights, planters, and other pedestrian amenities.
D. Visibility and Security. Bicycle parking shall be visible to cyclists from street sidewalks or
building entrances, so that it provides sufficient security from theft and damage.
E. Options for Storage. Bicycle parking requirements for long-term and employee parking can be
met by providing a bicycle storage room, bicycle lockers, racks, or other secure storage space
inside or outside of the building.
F. Lighting. Bicycle parking shall be at least as well-lit as vehicle parking for security.
G. Reserved Areas. Areas set aside for bicycle parking shall be clearly marked and reserved for
bicycle parking only.

shall be located so as to not conflict with vision clearance standards (Section 10-3B-2,
subsection N).
10-3D-5 Loading Space Standards
It is the intent of this section to require all future commercial, business, institutional, or industrial
development to provide off-street loading facilities in order to guarantee full utilization of existing rights
of way to accommodate present and future traffic demands. Off-street loading facilities are intended to
provide adequate space to accommodate outside deliveries from large vehicles which cannot be
functionally served by normal parking stalls. Off-street loading facilities must be located in such a
manner that service vehicles do not block or intrude into public rights of way or block driveways or
parking area circulation.
A. Location and Design.
1. All off-street loading spaces shall be designed to minimize impacts on adjacent
properties.
2. In all cases, loading facilities shall be located on the same lot as the structure they are
designed to serve. Required yards cannot be used for loading. Off-street loading space
shall not be included in an area used to satisfy off-street parking requirements.
3. Loading spaces shall be designed and located so vehicles using these spaces do not
project into any public right-of-way or otherwise extend beyond property lines.
4. Loading spaces shall be designed and built so no vehicles are required to back to or
from an adjacent street, except for minor access for heavy trucking in industrial zones
on local access streets.
5. When a proposed structure is intended to be used concurrently for different purposes,
final determination of required loading spaces shall be made by the Zoning
April 13, 2020
City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 3 Page 3-34
Administrator, provided the loading requirement for the combined uses shall not be less
than the total requirement for each separate use.
B. Required Off-Street Loading Spaces. The minimum number of off-street loading spaces shall
be required according to the following table, unless the number is reduced by the Zoning
Administrator.

safety, and community identity and by providing opportunities for Liberty Lake businesses,
residents and property owners to appropriately display signage.
B. The regulations for signs have the following specific objectives:
1. To have signs that attract and invite rather than demand the public’s attention along the
City’s streetscapes.

April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-52
C. Sign Area Calculations. Sign area is the total area of a sign visible from any on viewpoint or
direction, excluding the sign support structure, and its size shall be calculated using the
methods described in items 1-4 below.
1. A wall sign shall be calculated by measuring the area created by drawing imaginary
straight lines around the entire copy or grouping of such letters, words or symbols, and
then multiplying A x B as illustrated in figure 3 below.
2. The sign area of a freestanding sign consisting of one sign shall be calculated as shown
in Figure 4 below. The sign area of a freestanding sign consisting of more than one (1)
sign shall be computed by adding together the total area(s) of all signs as shown in
Figure 5 below.
3. The sign area for multiple-sided signs shall be calculated as follows:
a. The total sign area for a two-sided (back to back) sign shall be calculated using
one (1) face, therefore allowing both faces to be of equal size (for example, a
two-sided sign has two faces with 18 square feet per side, therefore the sign
area is 18 square feet).
b. The sign area for a three-sided sign shall be equal to the total area of signage
permitted for a two-sided sign, for example, in item 3a above, a two-sided sign
is allowed 18 square feet of sign area per side which equals 36 total square
feet. If a three-sided sign is used instead of a one-sided or two-sided sign, the
three-sided sign may allocate the 36 total square feet among three sides,
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-53
therefore allowing three sides with 12 square feet per face for a total of 36
square feet of sign area.
4. The sign area of a monument sign consisting of a sign with a solid base shall be
calculated as shown in Figure 6 below. The sign area of a monument sign consisting of
signage within the base area shall be calculated as shown in Figure 7 below.
D. Maintenance of Signs. Signs that have been approved or that have been issued a permit shall
be maintained by the owner or person in possession of the property on which the sign is
located. Maintenance shall be such that the signage continues to conform to the conditions
imposed by the sign permit.
1. A damaged sign shall be repaired within thirty (30) days.
2. A sign, which has been damaged, to such extent that it may pose a hazard to passersby
shall be repaired or removed immediately.
E. Lighting. Internal and external sign illumination shall be of low intensity. External sign
illumination shall be down shielded and confined to the sign to minimize impacts to the
surrounding area. Illuminated Signs require an electrical permit that is obtainable from the
Washington State Department of Labor & Industries.

or non-wooden poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design
criteria:
a. Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures (including disconnect
switches and other appurtenant devices) shall be fully concealed within the
pole, unless such concealment is otherwise technically infeasible, or is
incompatible with the pole design, then the equipment enclosures must be
painted or otherwise camouflaged to appear as an integral part of the pole or
flush-mounted to the pole, meaning not more than 12 inches off of the pole, or
the minimum needed to achieve safety clearances and antenna tile needs, and
must be the minimum size necessary for the intended purpose, not to exceed
the volumetric dimensions of small wireless facilities.
b. The farthest point of any equipment enclosure may not extend more than 28
inches from the face of the pole.
c. All conduit, cables, wires, and fiber must be routed internally in the light pole,
when technically feasible. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires, and

antennas) shall only be permitted if the applicant can demonstrate that it is
technically infeasible to locate the equipment cabinet underground or at the
base of the pole.
e. An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than ten feet above
the height of the existing pole and the diameter may not exceed 18 inches,
measured at the top of the pole, unless the applicant can demonstrate that
more space is needed. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design
so that they appear as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or
painted to match the pole, if technically feasible, and shall be shrouded or
screened to blend with the pole except for canister antennas which shall not
require screening, if technically feasible. All cabling and mounting
hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall
be fully concealed and integrated with the pole.
f. An omnidirectional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing or
replacement non-wooden pole. Such antenna shall be no more than four (4)
feet in height, 18 inches in diameter, and must be mounted directly on the top
of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as
close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed
within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-65
g. Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is
replacing or the neighboring pole design standards utilized within the
contiguous right-of-way.

j. The height of the luminaire on a replacement pole shall match the height of the
luminaire on the pole that is being replaced.
k. The use of the pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered
secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole
serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the
pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small
wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment
shall be removed.
l. Exceptions to these standards may be granted by the zoning administrator (or
designee) upon the applicant’s demonstration that the strict application of such
standards are technically infeasible in a specific circumstance, and the
exception granted is the minimum exception necessary to address the
technical challenge.
2. Wooden Pole Standard. Small wireless facilities located on wooden poles shall conform
to the following design criteria:
a. The wooden pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a taller pole
for the purpose of accommodating a small wireless facility; provided, however,
that the replacement pole shall not exceed a height that is a maximum of 10
feet taller than the existing pole, unless a further height increase is required
and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height extension is
the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or
clearance from electrical and wire line facilities.
b. Replacement wooden poles must either match the approximate color and
materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used
by the pole owner in the city.

the utility pole, including wireless equipment associated with the antenna, and
any preexisting associated equipment on the pole, may not exceed 28 cubic
feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more
closely integrate with the pole design and do not cumulatively exceed 28 cubic
feet.
k. Mid-pole primary equipment cabinets (not including cabinets housing
antennas) shall only be permitted if the applicant can demonstrate that it is
technically infeasible to locate the equipment cabinet underground, at the
base, or near the top the pole.
l. An applicant who desires to enclose both its antennas and equipment within
one unified enclosure may do so; provided, that such enclosure is the minimum
size necessary for its intended purpose and the enclosure and all other
wireless equipment associated with the pole, including wireless equipment
associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the
pole does not exceed 28 cubic feet. The unified enclosure may not be placed
more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is

m. The visual effect of the small wireless facility on all other aspects of the
appearance of the wooden pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent
possible.
n. The use of the wooden pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be
considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function
of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes
unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of
accommodating the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall
be removed.
o. The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the city’s setback and
sidewalk clearance requirements and shall not be more than a 25 percent
increase of the existing utility pole measured at the base of the pole.
p. All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of the
pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The
number of conduit shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to
accommodate the small wireless facility.
q. Exceptions to these standards may be granted by the zoning administrator (or
designee) upon the applicant’s demonstration that the strict application of such
standards are technically infeasible in a specific circumstance, and the
exception granted is the minimum exception necessary to address the
technical challenge.
3. Wireless Only Pole Standard. All pole-mounted transmission equipment shall be
collocated on existing poles or replacement poles, unless permitted based on the
required justification for a new wireless only pole. A wireless only pole may be
permitted if the applicant submits a new pole justification report demonstrating to the
reasonable satisfaction of the zoning administrator that no pole currently exists within
the right-of-way within a 250-foot radius of the proposed new pole that is available for
use by the applicant and that would provide substantially equivalent functionality. If so
demonstrated, such new pole shall comply with the following design standards, in
addition to the other requirements detailed in this section. Wireless only poles shall:
a. Resemble existing poles in the right-of-way near that location, with the
exception of pole designs that are scheduled to be removed and not replaced;
if no existing poles are located in the right-of-way near this location, the new
wireless pole shall be a non-wooden pole; and,
b. Antennas and the associated facility equipment enclosures (including
disconnect features and other appurtenant equipment) shall be fully concealed
within the pole, unless such concealment is otherwise technically infeasible;
and,
c. Be located at least 180 feet from any existing pole, unless the applicant
demonstrates to the zoning administrator’s (or designee’s) reasonable
satisfaction that (i) the minimum separation requirement cannot be satisfied for
technical reasons and (ii) placement of the small wireless facility at a distance
less than 180 feet from an existing pole will meet the intent of reducing visual
clutter to the greatest extent practicable.
d. Exceptions to these standards may be granted by the zoning administrator (or
designee) upon the applicant’s demonstration that the strict application of such
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-68
standards are technically infeasible in a specific circumstance, and the
exception granted is the minimum exception necessary to address the
technical challenge.
E. Strand Mounted Facilities. Small wireless facilities mounted on cables strung between
existing poles shall only be permitted if the applicant has successfully demonstrated that
collocation of the proposed facility on an existing structure or a wireless only pole is technically
infeasible or inadequate for network objectives in that specific area. If so permitted based
upon such demonstration, the following standards shall apply in addition to all other
requirements of this section:
1. Each strand-mounted facility shall not exceed three cubic feet in volume;
2. Pole-mounted equipment for strand-mounted facilities shall meet the requirements for
pole-mounted small wireless;
3. Only one strand-mounted facility is permitted per cable between any two existing
poles;
4. The strand-mounted device shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest pole
and in no event more than six feet from the pole unless a greater distance is technically
necessary or required by the pole owner for safety clearance;
5. No strand-mounted device shall be located in or above the portion of the roadway
open to vehicular traffic; and,
6. Strand-mounted devices shall be installed to cause the least visual impact, including
by utilizing the minimum amount of exterior cabling or wires (other than the original
strand) necessary to meet the technological needs of the facility.
7. Exceptions to these standards may be granted by the zoning administrator (or
designee) upon the applicant’s demonstration that the strict application of such
standards are technically infeasible in a specific circumstance, and the exception
granted is the minimum exception necessary to address the technical challenge.
F. Traffic Signal Mounted Facilities. Small wireless facilities are not permitted on traffic signals
poles unless denial of the siting is demonstrated to be a prohibition or effective prohibition of
the applicant’s ability to provide telecommunications service in violation of 47 USC 253 and
332.
G. Standards for Facilities Attached to Existing Buildings. Small wireless facilities attached to
existing buildings shall conform to the following design criteria:
1. Small wireless facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do
not interrupt the building’s architectural theme.
2. The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is discouraged.
3. New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation
that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the architecture of the existing
building.
4. Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order
to provide the smallest offset from the building.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-69
5. Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to
conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual
impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited.
6. Small wireless facilities shall be painted or colored, and textured to match the adjacent
building surfaces.

10-3G-9 Installation
10-3G-1 Purpose and Applicability
A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide planning and design standards for public and
private transportation facilities and utilities. Streets are the most common public spaces,
touching virtually every parcel of land. Therefore, one of the primary purposes of this article is
to provide standards for attractive and safe streets that can accommodate vehicle traffic from
planned growth, and provide a range of transportation options, including options for driving,
walking, transit, and bicycling. This article is also intended to implement the City’s
Transportation Improvement Plan.
Important cross-reference to other standards: The City requires that streets provide direct
and convenient access, including regular intersections. Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation,
provides standards for intersections and blocks, and requires pedestrian access ways to break
up long blocks. Several references within this article refer to the City of Liberty Lake
Engineering Design Standards which is available from the City Engineer.
B. When Standards Apply. Unless otherwise provided, the standard specifications for
construction, reconstruction, or repair of transportation facilities, utilities, and other public
improvements within the City shall occur in accordance with the standards of this article and
the City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards. No development may occur unless the
public facilities related to development comply with the public facility requirements.
C. Standard Specifications. The City Engineer shall establish standard construction specifications
consistent with the concepts of this article and application of engineering principles. These
specifications shall be contained in the City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards and
they are incorporated in this code by reference.
D. Conditions of Development Approval. No development may occur unless required public
facilities are in place or guaranteed, in conformance with the provisions of this Code.
Improvements required as a condition of development approval, when not voluntarily accepted
by the applicant, shall be roughly proportional to the impact of development. Findings in the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-71
development approval shall indicate how the required improvements are roughly proportional
to the impact.
10-3G-2 Transportation Improvements
A. Development Standards. No development shall occur unless the development has frontage or
approved access to a public street, in conformance with the provisions of Article 10- 3B -
Access and Circulation, and the following standards are met:
1. Streets within or adjacent to a development shall be improved in accordance with the
Transportation Improvement Plan, the provisions of this article, and the City of Liberty
Lake Engineering Design Standards.
2. Development of new streets, and additional street width or improvements planned as a
portion of an existing street, shall be improved in accordance with this article and the
City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards. Public streets shall be dedicated to
the applicable city, county or state jurisdiction;
3. New streets and drives connected to a collector or arterial street shall be paved; and
4. The City may accept a future improvement guarantee [e.g., owner agrees not to object
against the formation of a local improvement district in the future in lieu of street
improvements if one or more of the following conditions exist:
a. A partial improvement may create a potential safety hazard to motorists or
pedestrians;
b. Due to the developed condition of adjacent properties it is unlikely that street
improvements would be extended in the foreseeable future and the
improvement associated with the project under review does not, by itself,
provide increased street safety or capacity, or improved pedestrian circulation;
c. The improvement would be in conflict with an adopted capital facility plan; or
d. The improvement is associated with an approved land division on property
zoned residential and the proposed land division does not create any new
streets.
5. Privately owned and maintained streets may be allowed, but are not encouraged.
However, private streets must meet all the design and construction standards required
for public streets. A homeowner's or property owner's association must be established
to provide for street repair and maintenance.
B. Creation of Rights-of-Way for Streets and Related Purposes. Streets shall be created through
the approval and recording of a final plat, binding site plan, or short plat; except the City may
approve the creation of a street by acceptance of a deed, provided that the street is deemed
essential by the City Council for the purpose of implementing the Transportation Improvement
Plan, and the deeded right-of-way conforms to the standards of this Code and the City of
Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards. All deeds of dedication shall be in a form
prescribed by the zoning administrator and shall name "the public," as grantee.
C. Creation of Access Easements. The City may approve an access easement established by
deed when the easement is necessary to provide for access and circulation in conformance
with Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation. Access easements shall be created and
maintained in accordance with the Fire Code.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-72
D. Street Location, Width, and Grade. Except as noted below, the location, width, and grade of
all streets shall conform to the Transportation Improvement Plan, as applicable, the City of
Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards; and an approved street plan or subdivision plat.
Street location, width, and grade shall be determined in relation to existing and planned streets,
topographic conditions, public convenience, and safety, and in appropriate relation to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets:
1. Street grades shall be approved by the City Engineer in accordance with the City of
Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards; and
2. Where the location of a street is not shown in an existing street plan (See subsection
‘G’), the location of streets in a development shall either:
a. Provide for the continuation and connection of existing streets in the
surrounding areas, conforming to the street standards of this article and the City
of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards, or
b. Conform to a street plan adopted by the City Council, if it is impractical to
connect with existing street patterns because of particular topographical or
other existing conditions of the land. Such a plan shall be based on the type of
land use to be served, the volume of traffic, the capacity of adjoining streets,
and the need for public convenience and safety.
E. Minimum Rights-of-Way and Street Sections. Street rights-of-way and improvements shall be
the widths listed in the City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards. Where a range of
width is indicated, the width shall be determined by the decision-making authority based upon
the following factors:
1. Street classification in the Transportation Improvement Plan;
2. Anticipated traffic generation;
3. On-street parking needs;
4. Sidewalk and bikeway requirements based on anticipated level of use;
5. Requirements for placement of utilities;
6. Street lighting;
7. Minimize or prevent drainage, slope, and critical area impacts, as identified by the
Comprehensive Plan;
8. Street tree location, as provided for in Section 10-3C-4;
9. Protection of significant vegetation, as provided for in Section 10-3C-2;
10. Safety and comfort for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians;
11. Street furnishings (e.g., benches, lighting, bus shelters, etc.), when provided;
12. Access needs for emergency vehicles; and
13. Transition between different street widths (i.e., existing streets and new streets), as
applicable.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-73
F. Traffic Signals and Traffic Calming Features.
1. Traffic-calming features, such as traffic circles, curb extensions, narrow residential
streets, and special paving may be used to slow traffic in neighborhoods and areas with
high pedestrian traffic.
2. Traffic signals shall be required with development when traffic signal warrants are met.
The location of traffic signals shall be noted on approved street plans. Where a
proposed street intersection will result in an immediate need for a traffic signal, a signal
meeting approved specifications shall be installed. The developer’s cost and the timing
of improvements shall be included as a condition of development approval.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-74
Traffic Calming Features
G. Future Street Plan and Extension of Streets.
1. A future street plan shall be filed by the applicant in conjunction with an application for
a subdivision in order to facilitate orderly development of the street system. The plan
shall show the pattern of existing and proposed future streets from the boundaries of
the proposed land division and shall include other parcels within 400 feet surrounding
and adjacent to the proposed land division. The street plan is not binding; rather it is
intended to show potential future street extensions with future development.
2. Streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the parcel or tract to be developed,
when the Zoning Administrator determines that the extension is necessary to give
street access to, or permit a satisfactory future division of, adjoining land. The point
where the streets temporarily end shall conform to a-c, below:
a. These extended streets or street stubs to adjoining properties are not
considered to be cul-de-sacs since they are intended to continue as through
streets when the adjoining property is developed.
b. A barricade (e.g., fence, bollards, boulders or similar vehicle barrier) shall be
constructed at the end of the street by the subdivider and shall not be removed
until authorized by the City or other applicable agency with jurisdiction over the
street. The cost of the barricade shall be included in the street construction
cost.
c. Temporary turnarounds (e.g., hammerhead or bulb-shaped configuration) shall
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-75
be constructed for stub streets over 150 feet in length and must be paved
according to the adjoining street standard.
H. Street Alignment and Connections.
1. Staggering of streets making "T" intersections at collectors and arterials shall not be
designed so that jogs of less than 300 feet on such streets are created, as measured
from the centerline of the street.
2. Spacing between local street intersections shall have a minimum separation of 125
feet, except where more closely spaced intersections are designed to provide an open
space, pocket park, common area, or similar neighborhood amenity. This standard
applies to four-way and three-way (off-set) intersections.
3. All local and collector streets which abut a development site shall be extended within
the site to provide through circulation unless prevented by environmental or
topographical constraints, existing development patterns, or compliance with other
standards in this code. This exception applies when it is not possible to redesign or
reconfigure the street pattern to provide required extensions. In the case of
environmental or topographical constraints, the mere presence of a constraint is not
sufficient to show that a street connection is not possible. The applicant must show why
the environmental or topographic constraint precludes some reasonable street
connection.
4. Proposed streets or street extensions shall be located to provide direct access to
existing or planned commercial services and other neighborhood facilities, such as
schools, shopping areas, parks, and transit facilities.
5. In order to promote efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation throughout the city, the
design of subdivisions and alignment of new streets shall conform to the standards in
Section 10-3B-2, subsection 'J'.
I. Sidewalks, Planter Strips, Bicycle Lanes. Sidewalks, planter strips, and bicycle lanes shall be
installed in conformance with the standards in Section 10-3G-2, Section 10-3B-3, Section 10-
3C-4, applicable provisions of the Transportation Improvement Plan, the Comprehensive Plan,
adopted street plans, and the City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards. Separated
sidewalks with planters shall be required along both sides of streets in all new developments,
unless existing sidewalks prohibit the use of separated sidewalks or physical constraints (e.g.,
topography) prevent construction in conformance with the standards, as determined by P&CD
and additional sidewalks or pathways will be required within the development or the City. The
use of urban streetscapes is encouraged in mixed use zones and designs shall be reviewed
for compliance with the intent of the street tree and sidewalk standards. Maintenance of
sidewalks, curbs, and planter strips is the continuing obligation of the adjacent property owner
and sidewalks shall be kept free of obstructions to pedestrians at all times.
J. Intersection Angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at an angle as near to a right
angle as practical, except where topography requires a lesser angle or where a reduced angle
is necessary to provide an open space, pocket park, common area, or similar neighborhood
amenity. See the City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards for details.
K. Existing Rights-of-Way. Whenever existing rights-of-way adjacent to or within a tract are of less
than standard width, additional rights-of-way shall be provided at the time of subdivision or
development, subject to the provision of this article.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-76
L. Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac should be no more than 200 feet long and shall only be used when
environmental or topographical constraints, existing development patterns, or compliance with
other standards in this code preclude street extension and through circulation.
M. Grades and Curves. Grades shall not exceed standards in the City of Liberty Lake Engineering
Design Standards.
N. Curbs, Curb Cuts, Ramps, and Driveway approaches. Concrete curbs, curb cuts, wheelchair,
bicycle ramps, and driveway approaches shall be constructed in accordance with standards
specified in Article 10-3B - Access and Circulation and the City of Liberty Lake Engineering
Design Standards.
O. Streets Adjacent to Railroad Right-of-Way. Wherever the proposed development contains or
is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the land shall be created.
New railroad crossings and modifications to existing crossings are subject to review and
approval by the Washington State Department of Transportation.
P. Development Adjoining Arterial Streets. Where a development adjoins or is crossed by an
existing or proposed arterial street, the development design shall separate residential access
and through traffic, and shall minimize traffic conflicts. The design shall include one or more of
the following:
1. A parallel access street along the arterial with a landscape buffer separating the two
streets;
2. Deep lots abutting the arterial or major collector to provide adequate buffering with
frontage along another street. Double-frontage lots shall conform to the buffering
standards in Section 10-3B-2, subsection F(4);
3. Screen planting at the rear or side property line to be contained in a non-access
reservation (e.g., public easement or tract) along the arterial; or
4. Other treatment suitable to meet the objectives of this subsection;
5. If a lot has access to two streets with different classifications, primary access shall be
from the lower classification street, in conformance with Section 10-3B-2.
Q. Alleys, Public or Private. Alleys shall conform to the standards in this Code and the City of
Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards. Alleys shall be provided off Local Access or
Collector Streets only, not Arterials, and shall connect to a Local Access or Collector street at
both ends.
R. Private Streets. Private streets shall not be used to avoid connections with public streets. Gated
communities (i.e., where a gate limits access to a development from a public street) are
prohibited, unless the streets conform to the public street standards in the City of Liberty Lake
Engineering Design Standards.
S. Street Names & Addresses. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets in Spokane County, except extensions of existing streets
may be permitted. Street names, signs, and numbers shall conform to the established pattern
in the City. Addresses shall be assigned by the City and provided off streets only. If a building
does not have street frontage (e.g. common area or pedestrian path frontage), then the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 3 Page 3-77
address shall be provided based on the street connection point for vehicular access and
appropriate signage shall be provided for public safety. Exceptions may be granted by the
Zoning Administrator for specific situations, including auto-court lanes.
T. Survey Monuments. Upon completion of a street improvement and prior to acceptance by the
City, it shall be the responsibility of the developer's registered professional land surveyor to
provide certification to the City that all boundary and interior monuments shall be reestablished
and protected.
U. Street Signs. The city, county, or state with jurisdiction shall install all signs for traffic control
and street names, unless it is delegated to the developer. The cost of signs required for new
development shall be the responsibility of the developer. Street name signs shall be installed
at all street intersections. Stop signs and other signs may be required.
V. Mail Boxes. Plans for mail boxes to be used shall be approved by the United States Postal
Service.
W. Street Light Standards. Street lights shall be installed for all new development by the developer
/ applicant to encourage a pedestrian friendly environment and enhance community safety and
business exposure. Final lighting fixture selection and location shall be made by the City based
on developer / applicant proposals. The developer / applicant should coordinate with Avista
Utilities for style / fixture selection. All street light electrical installations including wiring,
conduit, and power connections shall be located underground. A plan shall be provided
showing the proposed fixture types and locations along with light fixture specification sheets
and each fixture shall be equipped with a photocell. Current AASHTO Roadway Lighting
Design Guidelines, or equivalent guidelines shall be utilized. The City Engineer shall make the
final determination of the lighting category applied to a site.
X. Street Cross-Sections. The final lift of asphalt or concrete pavement shall be placed on all new
constructed public roadways prior to final City acceptance of the roadway and within one year
of the conditional acceptance of the roadway, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
Street construction shall comply with the City of Liberty Lake Engineering Design Standards.
Street improvements shall be in place prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy on
any structure.

Permits
Sections:
10-4A-1 Introduction
10-4A-2 Concurrency
10-4A-1 Introduction
Chapter 4 provides all of the application requirements and procedures for obtaining permits required
by this Code. Please refer to Article 10-4B below to determine which land use permits and procedures
are required, and the decision-making body for a particular type of permit application.
10-4A-2 Concurrency
A. Concurrency Facilities and Services.
1. Applicability. The following facilities and services must be evaluated for Concurrency:
a. Public Water
b. Public Sewer
c. Transportation
d. Stormwater
e. Law Enforcement
f. Parks and Open Space
g. Libraries
h. Solid Waste Disposal
i. Street Cleaning
j. Public Transit

Concurrency Services. Concurrency requirements for public water and public sewer
service are detailed in Section 10-4A-2, subsection F below. A financial guarantee for
required improvements can be used to "final a project", but transportation facilities
serving a development must be constructed prior to occupancy. Applicable
permit/project applications shall require Transportation Concurrency Review,
described below. A Concurrency Certificate shall be issued to development proposals
that pass the Transportation Concurrency Review.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-3
3. Indirect Concurrency.
Stormwater, Law Enforcement, Parks and Open Space, Libraries, Solid Waste
Disposal, Street Cleaning, Public Transit, Fire and Emergency Services, and Public
Schools shall be considered Indirect Concurrency Services. The City of Liberty Lake
shall demonstrate the adequacy of Indirect Concurrency services through the Capital
Facilities Plan (CFP). The CFP will be updated annually, at which time all Indirect
Concurrency Services will be evaluated for adequacy. The evaluation will include an
analysis of population, Level of Service, and land use trends in order to anticipate
demand for services and determine needed improvements. If any Indirect
Concurrency Services are found to be inadequate, the City will adjust plans to lessen
the demand for services, include a project in the CFP to address the deficiency, or
adjust the Level of Service.
B. Transportation Concurrency and Review.
1. The following project permits/project applications shall be subject to Transportation
Concurrency Review.
a. Plats and Binding Site Plans
b. Short Plats
c. Zone Changes with site plans
d. Planned Unit Developments
e. Commercial/Industrial building permits
f. Residential building permits over 4 units
g. Conditional Use Permits
h. Manufactured Home Parks
i. Extension of time (see exemption No. 2.b.)
j. Change of conditions
A Certificate of Concurrency, issued by the City, shall be required prior to approval
of the above applications, if applicable.

a. Project permits that were issued, or project applications that were determined
to be complete (see RCW 36.70B) prior to the effective date of these
Concurrency Regulations.
b. Any project permit that will have insignificant transportation impact, and that
will not change the traffic volumes and flow patterns in the peak travel periods,
as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
c. The following project actions:
i. Boundary line adjustments;
ii. Final Plats/ Final PUD’s/ Final Short Plats/ Final Binding Site Plans;
iii. Temporary Use Permits;
iv. Variances.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-4
d. Proposed project permits/project applications that do not create additional
impacts on transportation facilities. Such projects may include but are not
limited to:
i. Any addition or accessory structure to a residence with no change or
increase in the number of dwelling units, up to 4 units;
ii. Interior renovations with no change in use or increase in number of
dwelling units, up to 4 units;
iii. Any addition, remodel, or interior completion of a structure for use(s)
with the same or less intensity as the existing use or a previously
approved use.
C. Transportation Concurrency Review Procedures.
1. Applicability. All project permits, except for those exempt, shall apply for
Transportation Concurrency Review at the time applications for project permits are
submitted. Inquiries about availability of capacity on transportation facilities or
applicable mitigation fees may be made prior to project permit applications, but
responses to such inquiries are advisory only and available capacity can only be
reserved through a Concurrency Certificate as set forth in these regulations. These
procedures may not apply if a transportation mitigation plan is adopted that specifies
procedures for transportation mitigation.
2. Procedures.
a. Applications for Transportation Concurrency Review shall be submitted on
forms provided by the City.
b. Transportation Concurrency Review shall be performed for the specific
property, uses, densities, and intensities based on the information provided by
the Applicant/Property Owner. The Applicant/Property Owner shall specify
densities and intensities that are consistent with the uses allowed.
c. The City shall issue a Concurrency Determination, if a mitigation fee is not
being utilized.
d. The City shall notify the Applicant/Property Owner of the results of the
Concurrency Determination or of the applicable required mitigation fees within
30 days of receipt of Application for Transportation Concurrency Review. If
additional information is needed to determine Concurrency, such additional
information may be requested by the City. Such request shall not make the
original project application deemed incomplete.
e. The project permit may be conditioned as necessary to ensure that an
improvement relied upon to demonstrate Concurrency will be completed.
f. If the proposed project fails the Concurrency Test and the project permit cannot
be conditioned to accomplish concurrency, the project permit(s) shall be
denied.
g. If the proposed project passes the Concurrency Test, the City shall issue a
Concurrency Certificate to the Applicant/Property Owner. The Certificate shall
be used to maintain an accounting of traffic impacts on City Streets and the
capacity that has been reserved or the mitigation fee that is required to be paid.
h. If the project permit has been withdrawn, expires, or is otherwise cancelled, the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-5
Concurrency Certificate shall automatically be voided.
3. Relation to Other Requirements.
Compliance with or exemption from the requirements of these regulations shall not
exempt a project from compliance with all other City, County, State, and Federal
regulations.
4. Concurrency Certificate.
a. A Concurrency Certificate shall only be issued upon payment of any
concurrency or mitigation fee due.
b. A Concurrency Certificate shall apply only to the specific land uses, densities,
intensities, and project described in the application and project permit.
c. A Concurrency Certificate is not transferable to other property, but may be
transferred to new owners of the same property.
d. A Concurrency Certificate shall remain valid so long as the accompanying
project permit has not expired or been revoked.
e. A Concurrency Certificate is valid for any modification of the permits for which
the Certificate was issued so long as such modification does not require the
Applicant to obtain a new project permit.
f. Any capacity that is not used because the full extent of the development is not
built shall be returned to the pool of available capacity.
5. Concurrency Certificate and Mitigation Fees.
Fees for issuing Concurrency Certificates shall be based on an adopted fee schedule.
Mitigation fees shall be based on the adopted mitigation plan.
D. Phased Development. When a project is proposed in phases or construction is expected to
extend over some period of time, the Applicant/Property Owner may offer a schedule of
occupancy that will be used by the City to determine the schedule of transportation
improvements that must be completed, or financially guaranteed, prior to the finaling of each
phase. However, the required transportation improvements shall be determined by analyzing
the traffic impacts estimated to be generated by the fully completed project.
E. Transportation Concurrency Test Procedures.
1. Highway Capacity Manual methods selected by the City Engineer shall be used to
analyze project impacts to intersections.
2. Level of Service information in the Capital Facilities Plan, which is updated annually,
shall be used as a starting reference to analyze project impacts.
3. Level of Service information shall be updated as necessary to account for traffic levels
resulting from the following:
a. traffic from newly constructed projects;
b. projects for which traffic impacts have been tentatively reserved;
c. projects for which a Concurrency Certificate has been awarded; and
d. non-project, general background traffic increases.
e. Level of Service information shall also be updated as necessary as a result of
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-6
any discontinued Concurrency Certificates, funded road projects, or new Level
of Service analysis.
4. Each City intersection affected by the proposed projects shall be reviewed and
analyzed for Concurrency. The Applicant/Property Owner may be required to provide
a traffic analysis if existing information does not provide adequate information for the
Concurrency assessment.
5. Project proposals shall pass the Concurrency Test if:
a. the transportation impacts from the proposed project does not decrease the
Level of Service of affected intersections below the adopted standards; or
b. the Applicant/Property Owner agrees to modify the project or provide
transportation improvements and/or binding financial commitments that will
result in the Level of Service of each deficient intersection meeting or
exceeding the adopted standards.
F. Water and Sewer Concurrency. New development shall not be approved unless the proposal
can demonstrate the availability of public water and sewer services consistent with adopted
Levels of Service, and consistent with the definition for Concurrency in the City
Comprehensive Plan. New development must:
1. Be connected to a public sewer at the time of occupancy.
2. Developer-financed extensions of public sewer may be allowed provided capacity and
infrastructure needs are adequately addressed. For purposes of this section, new
development shall include plats, short plats, binding site plans, manufactured home
park site development plans, planned unit development, and zoning reclassifications.
Conditional use permits shall also be considered new development if the proposed
use would result in an increased amount of wastewater generated on the site. New
development not requiring sewer and/or water service (e.g. cellular towers) is exempt
from this section.
G. Applicability to Vested Projects. These regulations shall not apply to land use applications
vested in accordance with state and local law.
H. Conflicts Between Provisions. This article shall apply as an overlay and in addition to other
adopted plans, ordinances, and regulations affecting lands in the City. In the event of any
conflict between this article and an adopted mitigation plan or impact fee ordinance, the
provisions of the adopted mitigation plan or impact fee ordinance shall prevail. In the event of
any conflict between this article and any other ordinances, and/or regulations, the provisions
of this article shall prevail. In the event of any conflict between this article and any
development agreement which has been executed under RCW 36.70B.170, prior to the
adoption of the Development Code, the development agreement or provisions therein shall
govern and prevail during the term of the agreement.

10-4B-1 Purpose
The purpose of this article is to establish standard decision-making procedures that will enable the
City, the applicant, and the public to reasonably review applications and participate in the local
decision-making process in a timely and effective way. The City utilizes a consolidated project permit
process which provides for integrated processing of multiple discretionary permits issued by the City
of Liberty Lake related to a specific project and environmental review on that project. Consolidated
project review also provides for coordinated meetings and hearings associated with the project. Most
project permits can be processed between a 60 and 120 day timeframe. Applicants that promptly
prepare and supply required items will aid in expediting the overall process.
10-4B-2 Determination of Procedure Type
The Zoning Administrator or his or her designee shall determine the proper procedure type for all
permit applications according to the set procedure types outlined in this article. Where no procedure
type is specified for a particular project permit application, the Zoning Administrator or his or her
designee shall determine the appropriate procedure type based upon the procedure used for similar
permits. If there is a question as to the appropriate procedure type, the Zoning Administrator or his or
her designee, shall resolve it in favor of the procedure type that provides the greatest opportunity for
public notice and participation. The procedures for Administrative Interpretations are outlined in Article
10-4G and appeals of Notice of Violations are covered in Section 10-1D-8.
10-4B-3 Project Procedure Types
Land use and development permit applications shall be decided by using the procedures contained
in this article. Building permits may need to be reviewed for compliance with design standards,
zoning, etc., however the permit is issued pursuant to Title 9, Building Regulations.
Additionally, some projects may need to be reviewed for compliance with other Titles within the City
Municipal Code. Specific procedures for certain types of permits are contained in Section 10-4B-4.
The procedure “type” assigned to each permit governs the decision-making process for that permit.
There are five types of permit/decision-making procedures: Exempt, Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type
IV. These procedures types and the projects associated with each procedure type are described in
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-8
subsections A-E below.
A. Exempt Projects. Exempt projects do not require project permit review processes because
they are generally smaller scale permits or administrative actions by the City that are not
required to go through public notice provisions, full agency review, or State Environmental
Policy Act (SEPA) review. Decisions on Exempt Projects are made by the Zoning
Administrator and depending on the type and complexity of the project, review time can vary,
however, it is the City's goal to process projects as quickly as possible. The following projects
are exempt from the full project permit review process:
1. Accessory Dwelling Units
2. Administrative Interpretations and Minor Modifications
3. Approach Permits
4. Class A Variance
5. Commercial, Industrial, Grading, & other building permits that may require a site plan
review meeting and design review, but do not require SEPA or the required SEPA
review has been conducted by another public agency.
6. Major modifications to existing Commercial, Industrial, Grading, & other building
permits that may require a site plan review meeting and design review, but do not
require SEPA or the required SEPA review has been conducted by another public
agency.
7. Mechanical & Plumbing Permits
8. Boundary Line Adjustments
9. Home Occupation Permits
10. Public Assembly Permits
11. Right of Way Permits
12. Sign & Temporary Sign Permits
13. Temporary Use Permits
14. Street Vacations (Requires a final City Council approval)
15. Small Wireless Facilities Permit
B. Type I Projects. Type I project permits are generally administrative decisions that usually
require SEPA with minimal notice requirements, and decisions are made by the Zoning
Administrator or his or her designee, without a public hearing. The Type I procedure is used
when there are clear and objective approval criteria, and applying City standards and criteria
requires no use of discretion. The following projects are classified as Type I projects:
1. Commercial, Industrial, Grading, & other building permits that require SEPA
2. Major modifications to existing Commercial, Industrial, Grading, & other building
permits that require SEPA.
3. Manufactured Home Parks
4. Preliminary Binding Site Plans (BSP) or Change of Conditions to an existing BSP
5. Shoreline Substantial Development Permits, Shoreline Conditional Uses, and
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-9
Shoreline Variances
6. Short Plats
7. Top Soil Removals
C. Type II Projects. Type II project permit decisions are Hearing Examiner decisions that require
an 'open record' public hearing before the Hearing Examiner, full public notice, and they may
or may not require SEPA. Appeals are reviewed by the Spokane County Superior Court. The
following projects are classified as Type II projects:
1. Conditional Use Permits or major modifications to an existing permit
2. Revocation of a Shoreline Permit
3. Special Use Permits
4. Class B Variances
5. Preliminary Plats and major modifications (change of conditions) to existing plats
6. Property Rezones (individual properties)
D. Type III Projects. Type III project permit decisions are City Council decisions that require an
'open record' public hearing before the Hearing Examiner and approval by the City Council
after an additional 'closed record' public hearing where the Council reviews the Hearing
Examiner's recommendation and the public record. Type III projects may or may not require
SEPA and project decisions generally use discretionary approval criteria. Appeals are
reviewed by the Spokane County Superior Court. The following projects are classified as Type
III projects:
1. Preliminary Planned Unit Developments (PUD) and major modifications to approved
PUD’s
E. Type IV Projects. Type IV procedures apply to legislative matters and Type IV projects are
not project permits. Legislative matters involve the creation, revision, or large-scale
implementation of public policy (e.g., adoption of land use regulations, zone changes, and
comprehensive plan amendments which apply to entire districts). Type IV matters are
considered initially by the Planning Commission with final decisions made by the City Council.
The project permit 120 day process timeline shall not apply to Type IV projects and Type IV
projects shall only be reviewed once a year. See Section 10-4B-5 for specific information
governing Type IV projects. The following projects are classified as Type IV projects:
1. Comprehensive Plan Amendments
2. Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map Amendments
3. Development Regulations Amendments
4. Official Zoning Map Amendments (area-wide)
10-4B-4 Project Permit Review Process & Timeline
The following procedures outline a chronological process for local review of project permits with
specifics for each project type being specified. Some review process steps may not apply to all project
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-10
types or some processes may be waived at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator and as allowed
by state law. See Table 4-A on Page 21 for review process requirements. Although Type IV projects
may utilize some of the process steps, they are not project permits. If applicable, as a part of the
review process and notice provisions for project permits, all plats, short plats, development permits,
and building permits issued for development activities on, or within five hundred feet of, lands
designated as agricultural lands, forest lands, or mineral resource lands, shall contain a notice that
the subject property is within or near designated agricultural lands, forest lands, or mineral resource
lands on which a variety of commercial activities may occur that are not compatible with residential
development for certain periods of limited duration. The notice for mineral resource lands shall also
inform that an application might be made for mining- related activities, including mining, extraction,
washing, crushing, stockpiling, blasting, transporting, and recycling of minerals. The review process
typically includes:
A. Pre-Application Conferences.
Pre-application conferences provide permit applicants with information regarding what
general requirements must be met to process an application packet and the project permit
review process. At pre-application conferences, the City will, as applicable:
1. Cite the comprehensive plan policies and map designations applicable to the proposal;
2. Cite the development code provisions, including substantive and procedural
requirements applicable to the proposal;
3. Provide available technical data and assistance which will aid the applicant;
4. Identify other governmental policies and regulations that relate to the application;
5. Reasonably identify other opportunities or constraints concerning the application; and,
6. When drawings are provided prior to the pre-application conference, feedback from
the design review subcommittee may be provided, if applicable.
B. Submittal of Application Packet and SEPA Checklist (as applicable).
The City of Liberty Lake does not allow delayed submittals and encourages preliminary
application packets and SEPA Checklists to be submitted at or before the Pre-Application
Conference in order to expedite the review process, if possible. Some Type I project permits
can be processed in less than sixty (60) calendar days. Type II and Type III project permits
usually take between ninety (90) and one hundred twenty (120) calendar days to process.
Applicants that promptly supply and prepare required items will aid in expediting the overall
process. The following outlines the minimum application requirements.
1. Application shall be made on forms provided by the City and shall include information
requested on the application form which addresses the criteria with sufficient detail for
review and action.
2. Required submittals for each project shall be supplied with the completed application,
including a City of Liberty Lake SEPA Checklist, if applicable.
3. Fees shall be established by the City per the adopted City fee schedule.
C. Determination of Completeness (DOC).
The Determination of Completeness (DOC) is issued to permit applicants to advise them that
the necessary paperwork has been submitted, including complete application packets and a
SEPA checklist (if applicable) or what items need to be submitted to make the application
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-11
packet complete. The “procedural submission requirements“ of the City have been met so
City departments and other public agencies can begin review of an application packet, or if all
required application packet documents have not been included, what is still needed.
Preliminary SEPA review, if applicable, is also conducted during this phase.
Within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receiving a project permit application, unless the
City is waiting for the applicant to provide additional documents or information, the Zoning
Administrator shall mail or provide in person a written determination to the applicant, stating
either:
1. That the application is complete; or
2. That the application is incomplete and what is necessary to make the application
complete.
a. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the applicant has submitted the
required additional information to the Zoning Administrator, the applicant shall
be notified whether the application is complete or what additional information
is still necessary to make the application complete.
b. If the applicant fails to submit the required additional information to the Zoning
Administrator within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the City requested
the information, the application shall be considered expired and the project
shall be required to re-start the project permit process as defined above in
Section 10-4B-4. One (1) extension may be granted by the Zoning
Administrator provided that:
i. There have been no changes to the applicable Code provisions since
the application was originally submitted. If there have been changes to
the applicable Code provisions and the application does not comply
with those changes, then the extension shall not be granted; in this
case, the project shall be required to re-start the project permit process;
ii. The applicant demonstrates that failure to submit the required
additional information was beyond the applicant’s control (i.e. waiting
for plan revisions from architects or engineers, etc.); and,
iii. The applicant has requested the extension prior to the sixty (60)
calendar day expiration date.
3. Additionally, to the extent known, the Zoning Administrator shall identify other
agencies of local, state, or federal governments that may have jurisdiction over some
aspect of the application and as applicable, the DOC may include:
a. A preliminary determination of those development regulations that will be used
for project mitigation;
b. A preliminary determination of consistency, as provided under RCW
36.70B.040; or,
c. Other information or required studies that the City chooses to include.
4. Issuance of a DOC shall not preclude the City from requesting additional information
or studies either at the time of the determination of completeness or subsequently if
new information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur.
5. Changes or additions to the application after the issuance of a Determination of
Completeness.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-12
Once an application is deemed complete:
a. All documents and other evidence changed or added by the applicant shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator or his or her designee at least fourteen
(14) calendar days prior to the mailing of the Notice of Hearing, if possible.
Documents or other evidence submitted after that date may be received by the
Zoning Administrator or his or her designee, and transmitted to the Hearing
Examiner, but may be too late to include with the staff report and
recommendation;
b. When documents or other evidence are submitted by the applicant during the
review period, but after the application is deemed complete, the assigned
review person or body shall determine whether or not the new documents or
other evidence submitted by the applicant significantly change the application;
c. If the assigned reviewer determines that the new documents or other evidence
significantly change the application, the reviewer shall submit to the applicant
and the Hearing Examiner a written determination that a significant change in
the application has occurred. In the alternate, the reviewer may inform the
applicant either in writing, or orally at a public hearing, that such changes may
constitute a significant change (see “4”, below), and allow the applicant to
withdraw the new materials submitted, in order to avoid a determination of
significant change;
d. If the applicant's new materials are determined to constitute a significant
change in an application that was previously deemed complete, the City shall
take one of the following actions, at the request of the applicant:
i. Suspend the existing application and allow the applicant to submit a
new application with the proposed significant changes. Before the
existing application can be suspended, the applicant must consent in
writing to waive the 120-day timeline on the existing application. If the
applicant does not consent, the City shall not select this option; or
ii. Reject the new documents or other evidence that has been determined
to constitute a significant change, and continue to process the existing
application without considering the materials that would constitute a
significant change. The City will complete its decision making process
without considering the new evidence.
e. If a new application is submitted by the applicant, that application shall be
subject to a separate check for acceptance and completeness and will be
subject to the standards and criteria in effect at the time the new application is
accepted.
D. Notice of Application (NOA).
The City shall provide a Notice of Application (NOA) to the public, and the departments and
agencies with jurisdiction that an application has been submitted and that the opportunity for
comment is available within the defined fourteen (14) calendar day comment period. Notice
occurs via mail, posting on the City website, publication in the official City newspaper, and onsite
signage, as applicable. The NOA is completed within 14 days of the DOC and provides
for a 14-day comment period. During this phase, preliminary State Environmental Policy Act
(SEPA) threshold determination would also be covered (if applicable).
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-13
When the City is the lead agency for SEPA, the Optional Determination of Nonsignificance
"Optional DNS" process may be used where the SEPA checklist is routed for comment with
the NOA and the Zoning Administrator may make a preliminary SEPA threshold determination
concurrently with the NOA. The NOA may also be combined with a scoping notice for a
determination of significance (DS) or the Zoning Administrator may issue a determination of
significance and scoping notice prior to the NOA. If the optional DNS process mentioned is
not being used, a Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS) or Mitigated Determination of
Nonsignificance (MDNS) threshold determination must be issued after the NOA. For Type III
and Type IV projects, if the SEPA threshold determination requires public notice, the City shall
issue the threshold decision at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the open record
predecision hearing before the Hearing Examiner or Planning Commission, as applicable.
1. The Notice of Application shall contain the following, as applicable:
a. The date of application, the date of the Determination of Completeness, and
the date of the Notice of Application;
b. A description of the proposed project action and a list of the project permits
included in the application and, if applicable, a list of any studies requested
under the DOC.
c. The identification of other permits not included in the application to the extent
known by the City;
d. The identification of existing environmental documents that evaluate the
proposed project and the location where the application and any studies can
be reviewed;
e. A statement of the public comment period, which shall be not less than fourteen
(14) nor more than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of the Notice of
Application, and statements of the right of any person to comment on the
application, receive notice of, and participate in any hearings, request a copy
of the decision once made, and any appeal rights.
f. The date, time, place, and type of hearing, if applicable and scheduled at the
date of the NOA;
g. A statement of the preliminary determination, if one has been made at the time
of notice, of those development regulations that will be used for project
mitigation, and of consistency as provided in RCW 36.70B.040; and,
h. Any other information determined appropriate by the City.

commercial, industrial, or mixed use zoned properties as provided in RCW 58.17.035.
3. Short subdivisions involve the division or redivision of land into four or fewer lots,
tracts, parcels, sites, or divisions for the purpose of sale, lease, or transfer of
ownership. A short plat is the map or representation of a short subdivision.
4. Boundary line adjustments involve modifications to lot lines or parcel boundaries which
do not result in the creation of new lots (includes consolidation of lots).
B. Carry out the City’s Comprehensive Plan visions, goals, and policies;
C. To prevent the overcrowding of land;
D. To lessen congestion in the streets and highways;
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-42
E. To promote effective use of land;
F. To promote safe and convenient travel by the public on streets and highways;
G. To provide for adequate light and air;
H. To facilitate adequate provision for water, sewerage, parks and recreation areas, sites for
schools and school grounds and other public requirements;
I. To provide for proper ingress and egress;
J. To provide for the expeditious review and approval of proposed subdivisions which
conform to City zoning standards, plans, and policies;
K. To adequately provide for the housing and commercial needs of citizens; and
L. To require uniform monumenting of land subdivisions and conveyancing by accurate legal
description.
10-4D-2 General Requirements
A. Compliance With Article 10-4B. Projects shall comply with Article 10-4B, Types of Applications
and Review Procedures on page 4-6 of this Code.
B. Compliance With RCW 58.17. All subdivision, binding site plan, and short subdivision
proposals shall be in conformance to state regulations set forth in the Revised Code of
Washington (RCW), 58.17, Plats - Subdivisions - Dedications.
C. Subdivision & Short Plat Approval Through Two-step Process. Applications for subdivision or
short plat approval shall be processed through a two-step process: the preliminary plat, BSP,
or short plat and the final plat or short plat.
1. The preliminary plat or short plat is a clear and approximate drawing of a proposed
subdivision, binding site plan, or short subdivision showing the general layout of
streets and alleys, lots, blocks, and other elements consistent with the requirements
of this article. The preliminary plat or short plat shall be the basis for the approval or
disapproval of the general layout of a subdivision, binding site plan, or short
subdivision. The preliminary plat or short plat shall be approved before the final plat or
short plat can be submitted for approval consideration; and
2. The final plat or short plat is the final drawing of the subdivision or short subdivision
and contains a dedication prepared for filing for record with the county auditor and
containing all elements and requirements set forth in this article. The final plat or short
plat shall include all conditions of approval of the preliminary plat or short plat.
D. Future Re-division Plan. When subdividing or short subdividing tracts into large lots (i.e.,
greater than two times or 200 percent the minimum lot size allowed by the underlying zoning
district), the City shall require that the lots be of such size, shape, and orientation as to
facilitate future re-division in accordance with the requirements of the zoning district and this
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-43
Code. A re- division plan shall be submitted which identifies:
1. Potential future lot division(s) in conformance with the housing and density standards
of Chapter 2;
2. Potential street right-of-way alignments to serve future development of the property
and connect to adjacent properties, including existing or planned rights-of-way.
3. A disclaimer that the plan is a conceptual plan intended to show potential future
development. It shall not be binding on the City or property owners, except as may be
required through conditions of land division approval. For example, dedication and
improvement of rights-of-way within the future plan area may be required to provide
needed secondary access and circulation.
E. Density. The following shall be used to calculate gross and net density for residential uses:
1. Gross Density is units or lots per acre.
Gross density = total lots / gross area of site
2. Net Density is units or lots per acre minus the area public or private right of way,
parks, common open space, and any other nonresidential use.
Net density = total lots / (gross area of site - right of way - parks - common open space
- any other nonresidential use)
F. Temporary Sales Office. A temporary sales office in conjunction with a subdivision may be
approved as set forth in Article 10-4I, Temporary Uses.
G. Environmental. All subdivisions, binding site plans, and short subdivisions shall be designed
based on the need to minimize the risk of flood damage. No new building lots shall be created
entirely within a floodway. All new lots shall be buildable without requiring development within
the floodway. Development in a 100-year flood plain shall comply with Federal Emergency
Management Agency requirements, including filling to elevate structures above the base flood
elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining such approvals from the appropriate
agency before City approval of the final plat, BSP, or short plat, if applicable. Additionally, if
required, projects shall be reviewed for compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act
(SEPA) and any other applicable environmental regulations as defined in state law or Chapter
6 of this Code.
1. Determination of Base Flood Elevation. Where a development site is located in or near
areas prone to inundation, and the base flood elevation has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be prepared by a qualified
professional, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
H. Need for Adequate Utilities. All lots created through land division shall have adequate public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems.
I. Need for Adequate Drainage. All subdivision and short subdivision proposals shall have
adequate surface water drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. Water quality
or quantity control improvements may be required; and
J. Floodplain, Park, and Open Space Dedications. All new land divisions shall be reviewed by
the City for parks and open space concurrency requirements. The City shall evaluate
individual development proposals and determine whether the dedication of land is justified
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-44
based on the development's impact to the park and/or trail system, consistent with Article 10-
3G. Where land filling and/or development is allowed within or adjacent to the 100-year flood
plain outside the zero-foot rise flood plain, and the Comprehensive Plan designates the
subject flood plain for park, open space, or trail use, the City may require the dedication of
sufficient open land area for a greenway adjoining or within the flood plain. When practicable,
this area shall include portions at a suitable elevation for the construction of a
pedestrian/bicycle pathway within the flood plain in accordance with the City’s adopted trails
plan or pedestrian and bikeway plans, as applicable.
K. Exemptions. The provisions of this article shall not apply to:
1. Cemeteries and other burial plots while used for that purpose;
2. Divisions made by testamentary provisions, or the laws of descent;
3. A division for the purpose of lease when no residential structure other than
manufactured / mobile homes or travel trailers are permitted to be placed upon the
land when the City has approved a binding site plan for the use of the land;
4. A division for the purpose of leasing land for facilities providing personal wireless
services while used for that purpose. "Personal wireless services" means any federally
licensed personal wireless service. "Facilities" means unstaffed facilities that are used
for the transmission or reception, or both, of wireless communication services
including, but not necessarily limited to, antenna arrays, transmission cables,
equipment shelters, and support structures.
10-4D-3 Approvals Process
A. Review of Preliminary Plat or Short Plat. Review of a preliminary plat shall be processed by
means of a Type II procedure, as governed by Article 10-4B. Review of a preliminary short
plat shall be processed by means of a Type I procedure, as governed by Article 10-4B. All
preliminary plats and short plats shall be reviewed using approval criteria contained in Section
10-4D-5. An application for a preliminary plat shall be processed simultaneously with
applications for rezones, variances, planned unit developments, and similar quasi-judicial or
administrative actions to the extent that procedural requirements applicable to these actions
permit simultaneous processing. Contiguous parcels that have one or more common owners,
one or more persons who have an interest in the entity that owns or has an ownership interest
in contiguous parcels, or a developer who intends to develop contiguous properties within a
five year period, must comply with the plat / subdivision requirements of this Code if the total
number of resultant lots will exceed four in number. The short plat / short subdivision process
shall not be used as a mechanism to avoid the requirements of the plat / subdivision
requirements where there are adjacent parcels under common ownership, as described
herein, that, but for the property boundaries, would be required to comply with the plat /
subdivision requirements. Multiple short plat applications shall not be utilized as a substitute
for comprehensive subdividing in accordance with the requirements of this Code.
B. Review of Final Plat or Short Plat. Review of a final plat for a subdivision or short plat shall
be processed administratively using the approval criteria in Section 10-4D-7.
1. For plats, the following signatures, as applicable, shall be on the face of the plat.

10-4E-1 Purpose
A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to implement the goals and policies of the City of Liberty
Lake Comprehensive Plan by promoting creativity in site layout and design, allowing flexibility
in the application of the standards for residential and mixed use development in order to
protect and enhance environmental features, encouraging the development of affordable
housing, and providing other public benefits. This article provides performance criteria to
encourage flexibility in the choice of the types of living units available to the public through the
planned unit development (PUD) process. More specifically, it is the purpose of this article to:
1. Encourage innovative planning that results in more mixed use development, improved
protection of open spaces, and greater housing and transportation options;
2. Encourage developments that recognize the relationship between buildings, their use,
open space, and transportation options, providing varied opportunities for innovative
and diversified living environments;
3. Facilitate the efficient use of land;
4. Promote an economic arrangement of land use, buildings, circulation systems, open
space, and utilities;
5. Preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing landscape features and
amenities, that may not otherwise be protected through conventional development;
6. Encourage energy conservation and improved air and water quality.
10-4E-2 Applicability
The planned unit development (PUD) designation is an overlay which may be applied over the City’s
zoning districts, as identified in the adopted zoning matrix. Existing subdivisions and lots of record on
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-73
which no development has yet occurred or where adequate vacant land exists within an existing
development to meet the standards and criteria of this article are eligible for PUD approval as changes
of condition to the original plat, short plat, or BSP and would be processed in the same manner as a
new land division application. An applicant may propose to develop a project as a PUD in compliance
with the requirements of this article, subject to confirmation by the City.
10-4E-3 Review and Approvals Process
A. Review Steps. There are three required steps to potential PUD approval:
1. Submittal of required PUD exhibits or information, concurrent with requirements for
plats, short plats, or BSP's (see Article 10-4D above), as applicable.
2. Adherence to the project permit processing steps in Article 10-4B; and
3. The approval of preliminary subdivision plat(s), short subdivision plats, or binding site
plans accompanied by PUD overlay, as applicable.
B. Approval Process.
1. The Subdivision Plat, Short Subdivision Plat, or Binding Site Plan, as applicable, and
the Planned Unit Development (PUD) shall be reviewed together, if applicable. The
Type III procedure in Article 10-4B, the submission requirements in Section 10-4E-7,
and the approval criteria in Section 10-4E-8, shall be used for the review of a
preliminary Planned Unit Development.
2. The project shall either be approved, approved with modifications/conditions, or
denied.
10-4E-4 Allowed Uses
The following uses may be permitted in an approved PUD:
1. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning district (Chapter 2);
2. Any use that the Comprehensive Plan specifically states is appropriate in the area that
includes the subject property and limited or conditional use requirements may be
modified if the modification is to meet the purpose of a PUD.
10-4E-5 Code Provision Modifications
A. The City may utilize a PUD to modify any of the provisions of the code if it can be demonstrated
that it furthers the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan and meets the purpose of a
PUD except the following:
1. The City may not modify any of the provisions of this Article; and
2. The City may not modify any provision of this code that specifically states that its
requirements are not subject to modifications under a PUD; and
3. The City may not modify any of the procedural provisions of this code; and
4. The City may not modify any provision pertaining to the installation and maintenance
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-74

improvements; and
6. The City may not modify any provision regulating signs; and
7. The City may not modify any provision that would be detrimental to the public health,
safety, or welfare.
B. Other Provisions of the City Municipal Code.
All other provisions of the City Municipal Code shall apply, except as modified by this article.
C. More than one overlay. When more than one overlay applies to the development (i.e. Specific
Area Plan Overlay Zone and a PUD), and standards conflict between the overlays, the more
restrictive standards shall apply (i.e., those which afford the greatest protection to identified
resources and amenities, compatibility between land uses, etc.), as determined by the Zoning
Administrator /designee.
10-4E-6 Density
The housing density standards shall be determined based on the densities in Chapter 2, provided
that the net density shall not exceed 30 du/acre. When allowed by the Comprehensive Plan, the City
may authorize a density bonus above the density allowed by Chapter 2 or this Title, as an incentive
to increase or enhance open space, protect critical areas, provide unique architectural character,
incorporate a mix of uses, and or accomplish other purposes of the zone. The density bonus shall
not result in the allowable density exceeding 10 percent of the allowable density in Chapter 2.

preferred siting location for the zone in which it is located (as detailed in City
Development Code §10-2, Zoning District Regulations), a siting justification report
shall be required to justify the need for the proposed facility location and design,
consistent with the siting hierarchy established for that zone, and standards as
established in City Development Code §10-3F-4.
5 The applicant may specify multiple sites in one small wireless permit application for
processing, if all proposed small wireless facilities in a batch are subject to the same
process type, utilize the same concealment technique, and are located on the same
type of facility (such as the same light standard), and within either the public right-ofway
or upon private property.
6. The applicant shall provide written authorization of the owner of any pole or structure
for the installation of its small wireless facilities on such pole or structure. For Cityowned
poles or structures, the applicant shall submit proof of a valid lease agreement
from the City.

detailed in City Development Code §10-6A-3, the applicant shall submit a completed
SEPA checklist.
9. The applicant shall submit a sworn affidavit signed by a radio frequency (RF) engineer
with knowledge of the proposed project affirming that the small wireless deployment,
as proposed, will be compliant with all FCC and other governmental regulations in
connection with human exposure to radio frequency emissions for every frequency at
which the small wireless facility will operate. If additional transmission facilities
necessary to the small wireless facility, such as microwave backhaul, are to be
provided by a third party, then the small wireless permit shall be conditioned on an RF
certification showing the cumulative impact of the RF emissions of the entire
installation. The applicant may provide one emissions report for the entire small
wireless deployment included in the application, if the applicant is using the same small
wireless facility configuration for all installations within that batch, or may submit one
emissions report for each facility installation identified in the batch.

subsection shall commence on the date of submission of the original
application, whether or not complete; provided, that the running of the maximum
time period shall be tolled upon timely issuance by the department of a notice
that the application is incomplete. The maximum review period shall restart on
the date that the applicant has provided the department with all of the
information required for a complete application.
G. Right-of-way permit required. A right-of-way permit shall be required for any work occurring
within the right-of-way that requires excavation, trenching, lane blockage, lane closure,
flagging or re-routing of traffic during installation, deployment, or ordinary maintenance and
repair activities, whether or not a Small wireless Communications Facility Permit is required.
The right-of-way permit will require inspections prior to and upon completion of work, to verify
that the site has been restored to its original condition and/or the approved restoration
conditions as may be required by the right-of-way permit.
H. SEPA. Proposals that are not categorically exempt from SEPA review shall comply with
SEPA, prior to and as a condition of permit issuance. When required, SEPA review shall be
conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in City Code §10-6A. SEPA review
shall occur concurrently with the permit review process prescribed in this chapter.
I. Denial. If the permit application is denied, the reasons for the denial shall be stated in writing
and supported by substantial evidence.
J. Suspension or Denial of Application for Lack of Compliance. The department may suspend
review of or deny a complete application for a small wireless permit if the department has
issued to the applicant a notice of violation related to any existing permitted facilities and the
applicant has not corrected the deficiency within the reasonable deadline required in the
notice of violation, as provided in City Code §10-1D.
K. Wireless Only Poles-. Wireless only poles may be permitted on a limited basis, subject to
siting criteria detailed in §10-2.
L. Annual Registration- All owners and providers with active small wireless facility permits within
the City of Liberty Lake shall be required to file an annual registration application on a form
provided the City, by January 31 of each calendar year.
1. The registration application will identify all active small wireless facilities within the
provider’s network within the City of Liberty Lake, identify any facilities that are no
longer in active use, and will include evidence that the FCC permits for all of the
applicant’s active small wireless facilities within the City are current and in good
standing. The applicant will provide an affidavit attesting that all small wireless
facilities within the provider’s network in the City of Liberty Lake, individually and
collectively, are in good working order and compliant with all FCC and other
governmental regulations in connection with human exposure to radio frequency
emissions for every frequency at which said facilities are operating. At the time of
registration, the owners and providers will also provide update/current performance
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-100
bonds and insurance, as required by their Franchise Agreement with the City of Liberty
Lake.
2. If the Franchise Agreement expressly addressing small wireless facilities within the
right-of-way is due to expire within the calendar year, the applicant will be required to
submit an application for renewal of the Franchise Agreement, providing all required
information, as detailed in Liberty Lake Municipal Code §8-8, and additionally, shall be
required to submit an updated certification from a certified radio frequency engineer
that all of the applicant’s small wireless facilities within the provider’s network in the
City of Liberty Lake, individually and collectively, are compliant with all FCC and other
governmental regulations in connection with human exposure to radio frequency
emissions for every frequency at which said facilities are operating.
M. Maintenance Requirements. The applicant shall maintain a permitted small wireless facility
to standards that may be imposed by the City at the time of the granting of a permit. Such
maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, maintenance of the paint, structural integrity,
etc. Small wireless communication facilities that fall into a state of disrepair, exceed the FCC
standards for RF emissions, have not been in active use for a period of six consecutive
months, or have permits that have lapsed for a period of more than 90 days, shall be removed,
at the expense of the owner. Failure for the owner to act within a reasonable notice period
shall cause the City to contract for the removal of said facilities, with proceeds from required
performance bond to cover the costs of said removal.
N. Ordinary Maintenance and Repair. For the purpose of this section, “ordinary maintenance
and repair” shall mean inspections, testing and/or repair of small wireless communication
facilities that maintain functional capacity, aesthetic and structural integrity of the facility and/or
the associated support structure, pole or tower, which does not require damaging or disturbing
any portion of the Public ROW. Ordinary maintenance or repair of an existing, permitted small
wireless facility does not require notice to, or approval of, the City, excepting a Right-of Way
permit, if the work necessitates a lane closure. Work that triggers the requirements of
paragraph N of this subsection shall not be considered “ordinary maintenance or repair” for
purposes of this section.
O. Material Changes to Permitted Small Wireless Facilities. A small wireless permit is required
prior to making material changes to permitted small wireless facilities. For the purpose of this
section, “Material change” shall be defined as:
1. Replacing transmission equipment at a permitted small wireless facility that increases
the overall volume or height or general appearance of the small wireless facility; or,
2. Adding new transmission equipment to a permitted small wireless facility.
P. Replacement and removal of transmission equipment. A permittee may replace or remove
transmission equipment used at a permitted small wireless facility without obtaining a small
wireless permit, consistent with paragraph M of this subsection, when:
1. Such replacement equipment is the same or smaller in size than the previously
permitted equipment that is being replaced; and,
2. The overall height of the facility (measured from the ground to the top of the highest
component of the facility) is not increased.

10-4J-3 Quasi-Judicial Amendments
10-4J-4 Conditions of Approval
10-4J-5 Record of Amendments
10-4J-6 Transportation Planning Rule Compliance
10-4J-1 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards and procedures for legislative and quasi- judicial
amendments to this Code and the zoning district map. These will be referred to as “map and text
amendments.” Amendments may be necessary from time to time to reflect changing community
conditions, needs and desires, to correct mistakes, or to address changes in the law.
10-4J-2 Legislative Amendments
Legislative amendments are policy decisions made by City Council, after receiving a
recommendation from the Planning Commission. They are reviewed using the Type IV procedure in
Article 10-4B and the amendment process must follow the adopted GMA Public Participation
Program Handbook, in addition, they shall conform to Section 10-4J-6, as applicable.
10-4J-3 Quasi-Judicial Amendments
A. Quasi-Judicial Amendments. Quasi-judicial amendments are those that involve the
application of adopted policy to a specific development application or Code revision. Quasijudicial
map amendments, also known as property rezones shall follow the Type II project
procedure, as governed by Article 10-4B, using standards of approval in Subsection “D”
below. The approval authority shall be as follows:
1. The Planning Commission shall review and comment on zoning district map changes
prior to the Technical Review meeting for the project, and their comments shall be
added to the staff report prepared for the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner's
decision shall be a recommendation to the City Council who shall decide such
applications;
2. If the Comprehensive Plan land use map needs to be updated to match a property
rezone, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council
on an application for a comprehensive plan map amendment, which is a Type IV
process, and would be reviewed during the yearly amendment process, unless the
amendment is declared an emergency. The City Council shall decide such
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-102
applications; and
3. Property rezones and Comprehensive Plan land use map amendments should be
conducted concurrently during the yearly amendment process to keep consistency
between zoning districts and land use categories, and the amendment process must
follow the adopted GMA Public Participation Program Handbook.
B. Criteria for Quasi-Judicial Amendments. A recommendation or a decision to approve, approve
with conditions, or to deny an application for a quasi-judicial amendment shall be based on all
of the following criteria:
1. Demonstration of compliance with all applicable comprehensive plan policies and map
designations. Where this criterion cannot be met, a comprehensive plan amendment
shall be a prerequisite to approval;
2. Demonstration of compliance with all applicable standards and criteria of this Code,
and other applicable implementing ordinances; and
3. Evidence of change in the neighborhood or community or a mistake or inconsistency
in the comprehensive plan or zoning district map regarding the property which is the
subject of the application, and the provisions of Section 10-4J-6, as applicable.
10-4J-4 Conditions of Approval
A quasi-judicial decision may be for denial, approval, or approval with conditions. A legislative
decision may be approved or denied.
10-4J-5 Record of Amendments
The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of amendments to the text of this Code and the
zoning districts map in a format convenient for public use.
10-4J-6 Transportation Planning Rule Compliance
A. When a development application includes a proposed Comprehensive Plan amendment or
zoning district change, the proposal shall be reviewed to determine whether it significantly
affects a transportation facility. A significant affect would do one or more of the following:
1. Change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility.
This would occur, for example, when a proposal causes future traffic to exceed the
capacity of “collector” street classification, requiring a change in the classification to
an “arterial” street, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan and Transportation
Improvement Plan;
2. Change the standards implementing a functional classification system;
3. Allow types or levels of land use that would result in levels of travel or access what are
inconsistent with the functional classification of a transportation facility; or
4. Reduce the level of service of the facility below the minimum acceptable level identified
in the Comprehensive Plan and Transportation Improvement Plan.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 4 Page 4-103
B. Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan and land use standards which significantly affect a
transportation facility shall assure that allowed land uses are consistent with the function,
capacity, and level of service of the facility identified in the Comprehensive Plan and
Transportation Improvement Plan (also see Section 10-4A-2 Concurrency). This shall be
accomplished by one of the following remedies:
1. Limiting allowed land uses to be consistent with the planned function of the
transportation facility; or
2. Amending the Comprehensive Plan and Transportation Improvement Plan to ensure
that existing, improved, or new transportation facilities are adequate to support the
proposed land uses; or
3. Altering land use designations, densities, or design requirements to reduce demand
for automobile travel and meet travel needs through other modes of transportation.

Article 10-5A — Introduction
Sections:
10-5A-1 Purpose
10-5A-1 Purpose
This Article provides standards and procedures for variances and non-conforming situations (i.e.,
existing uses or development that do not comply with the Code). This code cannot provide standards
to fit every potential development situation. The City’s varied geography, and complexities of land
development, require flexibility. Chapter 5 provides that flexibility, while maintaining the purposes and
intent of the Code. The variance procedures provide relief from specific code provisions when they
have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other codes.
The standards for non-conforming uses and development are intended to provide some relief from code
requirements for older developments that do not comply.

Article 10-5B — Variances
Sections:
10-5B-1 Purpose
10-5B-2 Class A Variance
10-5B-3 Class B Variance
10-5B-4 Variance Application and Appeals
10-5B-2 Class A Variance
A. Class A Variances. The following variances are reviewed using an Exempt Project procedure,
as governed by Article 10-4B, using the approval criteria in Subsection B, below:
1. Front yard setbacks - up to a 10 percent change to the front yard setback standard in
the zoning district.
2. Interior setbacks - up to a 10 percent reduction of the dimensional standards for the side
and rear yard setbacks required in the zoning district.
3. Lot coverage - up to 10 percent increase of the maximum lot coverage required in the
zoning district.
4. Landscape area - up to 10 percent reduction in landscape area (overall area or interior
parking lot landscape area).
5. Variance to minimum housing density standard (Chapter 2) - The Zoning Administrator
may approve a variance after finding that the minimum housing density provided in
Chapter 2 cannot be achieved due to physical constraints that limit the division of land
or site development. “Physical constraint” means steep topography, critical areas
(Chapter 6), unusual parcel configuration, or a similar constraint. The variances
approved shall be the minimum variance necessary to address the specific physical
constraint on the development.
6. Variance to Vehicular Access and Circulation Standards (Article 10-3B) - Where
vehicular access and circulation cannot be reasonably designed to conform to Code
standards within a particular parcel, shared access with an adjoining property shall be
considered. If shared access in conjunction with another parcel is not feasible, the
Zoning Administrator may grant a variance to the access requirements after finding the
following:
a. There is not adequate physical space for shared access, or the owners of
abutting properties do not agree to execute a joint access easement;
b. There are no other alternative access points on the street in question or from
another street;
c. The access separation requirements cannot be met;
d. The request is the minimum adjustment required to provide adequate access;
e. The approved access or access approved with conditions will result in a safe
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 5 Page 5-4
access; and
f. The visual clearance requirements will be met.
7. Variances to Street Tree Requirements (Article 10-3C) - The Zoning Administrator may
approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for a variance to the street tree
requirements in Article 10-3C, after finding the following:
a. Installation of the tree would interfere with existing utility lines;
b. The tree would cause visual clearance problems; or
c. There is not adequate space in which to plant a street tree; and
d. Replacement landscaping is provided elsewhere on the site (e.g., parking lot
area trees).
8. Variance to Parking Standards (Article 10-3D) - The Zoning Administrator may approve
variances to the minimum or maximum standards for off-street parking in Article 10-3D
upon finding the following:
a. The individual characteristics of the use at that location require more or less
parking than is generally required for a use of this type and intensity;
b. The need for additional parking cannot reasonably be met through provision of
on-street parking or shared parking with adjacent or nearby uses; and
c. All other parking design and building orientation standards are met, in
conformance with the standards in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.
d. The City may approve a reduction of required bicycle parking per Section 10-
3D-4, if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed use by its nature would
be reasonably anticipated to generate a lesser need for bicycle parking.
9. Variances to transportation improvement requirements (Article 10-3G).The Zoning
Administrator may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a variance to the
transportation improvement standards of Article 10-3G, based on the following:
a. Required improvements are not feasible due to topographic constraints or
constraints posed by critical areas.
B. Class A Variance Approval Criteria. A Class A Variance shall be granted if the applicant
demonstrates compliance with the requirements of each variance listed above and all of the
following criteria:
1. The variance requested is required due to the lot configuration, or other conditions of
the site;
2. The variance does not result in the removal of significant vegetation, and/or results in
preserving a tree or trees on the site or avoiding wetland impacts, if trees or wetlands
are present in the development area;
3. The variance will not result in violation(s) of Chapter 3, or other design standards.
10-5B-3 Class B Variance
A. Class B Variances. Class B variances shall be reviewed using a Type II Project procedure, in
accordance with Article 10-4B.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 5 Page 5-5
1. Class B variances may be granted if the applicant shows that, owing to special and
unusual circumstances related to a specific property, the literal application of the
standards of the applicable zoning district would create a hardship to development
which is peculiar to the lot size or shape, topography, critical areas (Chapter 6), or
other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no
control, and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity (e.g., the same
zoning district); except that no variances to “permitted uses” shall be granted.
2. Applicability.
a. The variance standards are intended to apply to individual platted and
recorded lots only.
b. An applicant who proposes to vary a specification standard for lots yet to be
created through a subdivision process may not utilize the Class B variance
procedure.
c. A variance shall not be approved which would vary the “permitted uses” of a
zoning district (Chapter 2).
B. Approvals Process and Criteria.
1. Class B variances shall be processed using a Type II Project procedure, in accordance
with Article 10-4B, using the approval criteria in subsection 2, below. In addition to the
requirements contained in Article 10-4B, the applicant shall provide a written narrative
or letter describing his/her reasoning for the variance, why it is required, alternatives
considered, and compliance with the criteria in subsection 2.
2. The City shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a variance
based on finding that all of the following criteria are satisfied:
a. The proposed variance will not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this
Code, to any other applicable policies and standards, and to other properties in
the same zoning district or vicinity;
b. A hardship to development exists which is peculiar to the lot size or shape,
topography, critical areas (Chapter 6), or other similar circumstances related to
the property over which the applicant has no control, and which are not
applicable to other properties in the vicinity (e.g., the same zoning district);
c. The use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and City
standards will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible
while permitting reasonable economic use of the land;
d. Existing physical and natural systems, such as but not limited to traffic, drainage,
natural resources, and parks will not be adversely affected any more than would
occur if the development occurred as specified by the subject Code standard;
e. The hardship is not self-imposed; and
f. The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the
hardship.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 5 Page 5-6
10-5B-4 Variance Application and Appeals (Class A or Class B)
The variance application shall conform to the requirements for Exempt or Type II applications (Article
10-4B), as applicable. In addition, the applicant shall provide a narrative or letter explaining the reason
for his/her request, alternatives considered, and why the subject standard cannot be met without the
variance. Appeals to variance decisions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of Article
10-4B.

Article 10-5C — Non-Conforming Uses and Development
Sections:
10-5C-1 Non-Conforming Uses
10-5C-2 Non-conforming Development
10-5C-3 Non-Conforming Lots
10-5C-4 Appeals
10-5C-1 Non-Conforming Uses
Where at the time of adoption of this Code a use of land exists which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this Code and was lawful at the time it was established, the use may be
continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
A. Expansion Prohibited. No such nonconforming use is enlarged, increased, or extended to
occupy a greater area of land or space than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Code. No additional structure, building, or sign shall be constructed on the
lot in connection with such nonconforming use of land;
B. Location. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the
lot other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Code;
C. Discontinuation or Abandonment. The nonconforming use of land is not discontinued for any
reason for a period of more than 12 months. For purposes of calculating the 12 month period,
a use is discontinued or abandoned upon the occurrence of the first of any of the following
events:
1. On the date when the use of land is physically vacated;
2. On the date the use ceases to be actively involved in the sale of merchandise or the
provision of services;
3. On the date of termination of any lease or contract under which the nonconforming use
has occupied the land; or
4. On the date a request for final reading of water and power meters is made to the
applicable utility districts.
D. Application of Code Criteria and Standards. If the use is discontinued or abandoned for any
reason for a period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the
applicable standards and criteria specified by this Code for the zoning district in which such land
is located, Chapter 3, and other applicable portions of this Code.
E. A business that is a non-conforming use may transfer ownership and keep its non- conforming
status as long as the provisions above are met.
F. Non-conforming land use may be replaced by a conforming land use. When land use is brought
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 5 Page 5-8
into compliance with the current code, it may not thereafter revert to or resume a nonconforming
land use, except where land has been developed and the land use resumes its
specific previous use and does not expand on its non-conformity.
10-5C-2 Non-Conforming Development
Previously built structures (including signs) that do not conform to the current codes may remain,
provided that the structure was originally constructed and remains in conformity with the then existing
codes, subject to the following provisions:
A. Nonconforming structures may not be altered in such a manner that would increase their
nonconformity under the current code; however nonconforming structures may be changed in
a manner that satisfies the current Development Code requirements or decreases the
nonconformity to those requirements. Where it is determined that implementation of the current
code is impractical, the applicability of the code requirements shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator or designee. Normal upkeep, repairs, maintenance, strengthening or restoration
to a safe condition of any nonconforming structure or part thereof shall be permitted subject to
the provisions of this section. Additionally, alterations required by law or the order of a public
agency in order to meet health and safety regulations shall be permitted;
B. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any
means to an extent more than 50 percent of its replacement cost, as determined by the building
code, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the Development Code unless compliance
with this Development Code is not practical, as determined by the Zoning Administrator or
designee; and
C. Should such structure be moved for any reason and by any distance, it shall thereafter conform
to the regulations of the Development Code. Nonconforming signage removed for building or
signage structure maintenance may be replaced after the maintenance has been completed
provided no changes have been made that would increase the nonconformity of the signage.
D. Conforming uses may continue to operate in a non-conforming structure as long as the
provisions above are met.
E. Nothing in this section shall prevent the full restoration by reconstruction of a structure which is
either listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Register of
Historic Places, the Washington State Cultural Resource Inventory, the Washington State
Historic Barn Registry, the City of Liberty Lake Cultural and Historical Heritage/Resources, or
an equivalent Register of Historic Places, or is listed in a council-approved historical survey
meeting the standards of the State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation.
“Restoration” means reconstruction of the historic or culturally significant structure with
as nearly the same visual design appearance and materials as is consistent with full
compliance with the State Building Code. The reconstruction of all such historic or
culturally significant structures shall comply with the life safety provisions of the State
Building Code.

10-5C-3 Non-Conforming Lots
A. A nonconforming lot is one which met applicable zoning ordinance standards as to size, width,
depth and other dimensional regulations at the date on which it was created but which, due to
the passage of a zoning ordinance, the amendment thereof, or the annexation of property to the
city, no longer conforms to the current provisions of the Development Code. A lot which was not
legally created in accordance with the laws of the local governmental entity in which it was
located at the date of the creation is an illegal lot and will not be recognized for development.
B. Legally created lots that do not conform to the current codes are considered nonconforming lots
of record and are legally buildable except as provided below:
1. To be legally buildable, a lot must be in compliance with the rules and regulations of the
health district. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this section and those
rules of the health district, the more restrictive rules shall apply.
2. A structure on a nonconforming lot of record must meet Development Code
requirements for the zone in which the property is located; with the exception of
minimum density standards. Where it is determined that implementation of the current
code is impractical, the applicability of the code requirements shall be determined by the
Zoning Administrator or designee.
3. A lot line adjustment shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit when a
nonconforming and conforming lot are abutting each other and under common
ownership, and a lot line adjustment will result in both legal lots being in conformance
with area, building setbacks, critical area regulations, and other applicable Development
Code requirements.
4. Where two or more abutting nonconforming lots of record are under common ownership
and they are aggregated into one lot. For that single aggregated lot to be subdivided, all
lots created shall conform to Development Code requirements.
10-5C-4 Appeals
Decisions on Non-Conforming Uses and Development can be appealable in the same manner as an
Administrative Interpretation.

1. For public proposals, the head (administrative official) of the department making
the proposal shall be the responsible official. For private proposals, the head
administrative official) of the department with primary responsibility for approving
the permits and licenses for the proposal shall be the responsible official. When
multiple officials have permitting authority, the assignment of responsibility shall
be reached by agreement.
2. For all proposals for which the City of Liberty Lake is the lead agency, the
responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping
and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and
perform any other functions assigned to the "lead agency" or "responsible
official" by those sections of the SEPA rules that are adopted by reference in
Section 10-6A-2, subsection "A" above.
3. The City of Liberty Lake shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-4
(Chapter 197-11 WAC) and make them available in accordance with Chapter
42.17 RCW.
C. Lead Agency Determination and Agency Responsibilities.
1. The department within the City of Liberty Lake receiving an application for or
initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead
agency for that proposal under sections 197-11-050, 197-11-253, and 197-11-
922 through 197-11- 940 WAC unless the lead agency has been previously
determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in
the process of determining the lead agency.
2. When the City of Liberty Lake is the lead agency for a proposal, the department
receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall
supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an
EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.
3. When the City of Liberty Lake is not the lead agency for a proposal, all
departments of the City of Liberty Lake shall use and consider, as appropriate,
either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the
proposal. No City of Liberty Lake department shall prepare or require preparation
of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency unless required
under section 197-11-600 WAC. In some cases, the City of Liberty Lake may
conduct supplemental environmental review under section 197-11-600 WAC.
4. If the City of Liberty Lake or any of its departments receives a lead agency
determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria
of section 197-11-253, or sections 197-11-922 through 197-11-940 WAC, it may
object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally
making the determination and resolved within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the
determination or the City of Liberty Lake must petition the Department of Ecology
for a lead agency determination under section 197-11-946 WAC within the fifteen
(15) day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the City of Liberty Lake may
be initiated by the potential responsible official.
5. Departments of the City of Liberty Lake are authorized to make agreements as
to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under sections
197-11-942 and 197-11-944 WAC, provided that the responsible official and any
department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement
approve the agreement.
6. Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall
require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies
have jurisdiction over the proposal (that is, which agencies require nonexempt
licenses).
D. Other Timing and Additional Considerations Applicable to the SEPA Process.
1. The following time limits shall apply when there is no established agency
procedure.
a. Threshold determinations - When the responsible official requires further
information from the applicant or consultation with other agencies with
jurisdiction:
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-5
i. the responsible official should request such further information
within seven (7) days of receiving an adequate application and
completed environmental checklist;
ii. the responsible official shall wait no longer than fourteen (14)
days for a consulted agency to respond;
iii. the responsible official should complete the threshold
determination within seven (7) days of receiving the requested
information from the applicant or the consulted agency.
b. When the responsible official must initiate further studies, including field
investigations, to obtain the information to make the threshold
determination, the responsible official should complete the studies within
thirty (30) days of receiving an adequate application and a completed
checklist.
c. The responsible official shall complete threshold determinations on
actions where the applicant recommends in writing that an EIS be
prepared within seven (7) days.
2. For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or Final Environmental Impact Statement
(FEIS) for the proposal shall accompany the department’s staff recommendation
to any advisory or final action body.
3. If the only action is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires
detailed project plans and specifications, the City of Liberty Lake may provide
the applicant with the opportunity for environmental review under SEPA before
requiring the applicant to submit such detailed project plans and specifications,
however, generally the City utilizes a consolidated project permit process.
a. The City of Liberty Lake may specify the amount of detail needed from
the applicant for such early environmental review, consistent with
sections 197-11- 100 and 197-11-335 WAC.
b. This subsection does not preclude an applicant from preliminary
discussions or exploration of ideas and options prior to commencing
formal environmental review.
10-6A-3 Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determinations
A. Purpose and Adoption By Reference. This section contains the rules for deciding
whether a proposal has a "probable significant adverse environmental impact" requiring
an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This section also contains
rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The City of Liberty
Lake adopts the following sections by reference, as supplemented in this section.

B. Flexible Thresholds for Categorical Exemptions. In addition to those exemptions
identified in Section 10-6A-9 (Categorical Exemptions), the City of Liberty Lake
establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under section 197-
11-800(1)(c) WAC, based on local conditions.
1. For residential dwelling units in section 197-11-800(1)(b)(i) WAC: up to 20
dwelling units.
2. For agricultural structures in section 197-11-800(1)(b)(ii) WAC: up to 20,000
square feet.
3. For office, school, commercial, recreational, service, or storage buildings in
section 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii) WAC: up to 12,000 square feet and up to 40 parking
spaces.
4. For parking lots in section 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv) WAC: up to 40 parking spaces.
5. For landfills and excavations in section 197-11-800(1)(b)(v) WAC: up to 500
cubic yards.
C. Categorical Exemptions App- licability.
1. If a proposal fits within any of the provisions in Section 10-6A-9 (Categorical
Exemptions) and this section, the proposal shall be categorically exempt from
the threshold determination requirements (section 197-11-720 WAC), except
when the proposal is a segment of a proposal that includes:
a. a series of actions, physically or functionally related to each other, some
of which are categorically exempt and some of which are not; or
b. a series of exempt actions that are physically or functionally related to
each other, and that together may have a probable significant adverse
environmental impact in the judgment of an agency with jurisdiction. If so,
that agency shall be the lead agency unless the agencies with jurisdiction
agree that another agency should be the lead agency. Agencies may
petition the department of ecology to resolve disputes (section 197-11-
946 WAC).
For such proposals, the agency or applicant may proceed with the exempt
aspects of the proposals, prior to conducting environmental review, provided the
requirements of section 197-11-070 WAC are met. See Section 10-6A-11 for an
informational matrix of exempt and nonexempt activities.
2. The lead agency is not required to document that a proposal is categorically
exempt. The lead agency may note on an application that a proposal is
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-7
categorically exempt or place such a determination in the agency’s files.
D. Use Exoefm ptions.
1. Each department within the City of Liberty Lake that receives an application for
a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the
proposal, shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The
department's determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not
subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural
requirements of this section applies to the proposal. The City of Liberty Lake shall
not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.
2. In determining whether a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain
the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses
required (section 197-11-060 WAC). If a proposal includes exempt and
nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the
license application that triggers the department's consideration is exempt.
3. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the City of Liberty
Lake may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural
requirements of this section, except that the City of Liberty Lake shall not
authorize:
a. any nonexempt action;
b. any action that would limit the choice of alternatives for environmental
review;
c. any action that would have a probable significant adverse environmental
impact.
4. A responsible official may withhold approval of an exempt action that would
modify the environment, when such modification would result in a probable
significant adverse impact or would limit the choice of alternatives for
environmental review.
5. A responsible official may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead
to an applicant making substantial financial expenditures when there is some
doubt that the entire proposal (i.e. subdivision) may not be approved.
E. Environmental Checklist.
1. A completed environmental checklist shall be filed prior to or at the same time
as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not exempted
in this section; except a checklist is not needed if the City of Liberty Lake and the
applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or
SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The checklist shall be
in the form provided by the City, which shall be based on the form in section 197-
11-960 WAC with questions potentially being added or modified.
2. For private proposals, the City of Liberty Lake will require the applicant to
complete the environmental checklist. For public proposals, the department
initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that
proposal.
3. The City of Liberty Lake may require that City staff, and not the private applicant,
complete all, or part of, the environmental checklist for a private proposal if the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-8
applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on
proposals currently under consideration, or if the City of Liberty Lake has
technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private
applicant. The applicant shall reimburse the City of Liberty Lake for time and
effort so expended.
4. During the review of the environmental checklist, the staff of the City of Liberty
Lake may make such changes or additions to the environmental checklist as are
necessary to make it an accurate statement. Alternatively, the staff may return
the checklist to the applicant for revisions and/or additional information.
5. For projects submitted under an approved planned action under section 197-11-
168 WAC, the City of Liberty Lake shall use its existing environmental checklist
form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in section 197-
11-315 WAC. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and
adopted along with, or as part of, a planned action ordinance, or developed after
the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental
checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a thirty
(30) days review prior to use.
F. Mitigated Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS).
1. As provided in this section and in section 197-11-350 WAC, the responsible
official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the
responsible official or on changes to or clarification of, the proposal made by the
applicant.
2. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under
section 197-11-350 WAC. The request must:
a. follow submission of a complete permit application and environmental
checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead
agency; and
b. precede the agency's actual threshold determination for the proposal.
3. The responsible official or a designee shall respond in writing to the request for
early notice within fourteen (14) days unless otherwise agreed to. Response
must:
a. state whether the City of Liberty Lake currently considers issuance of a
DS likely, and if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern
leading the City of Liberty Lake to consider a DS; and
b. state that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the
indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit
application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.
4. As much as possible, the lead agency should assist the applicant with
identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation
measures.
5. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised
or amended environmental checklist, the responsible official shall base the
threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make
the determination within fourteen (14) days of receiving the changed or clarified
proposal unless otherwise established by agency procedures.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-9
a. If the responsible official indicated specific mitigation measures in the
response to the request for early notice and the applicant changed or
clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the
responsible official shall issue and circulate a DNS pursuant to section
197-11-340(2) WAC.
b. If the responsible official indicated areas of concern but did not indicate
specific mitigation measures that would allow the issuance of a DNS, the
responsible official shall make the threshold determination, issuing a
DNS or DS as appropriate.
c. The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or
conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example,
proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are
inadequate, whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or
"construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y-location" are
adequate.
d. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be
incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies, or
other documents.
6. A mitigated DNS is issued either under section 197-11-340(2) WAC requiring a
fourteen (14) day comment period unless otherwise established by agency
procedure and public notice pursuant to Section 10-6A-5, subsection "B", or
under section 197- 11-355 WAC, which may require no additional comment
period beyond the comment period on the notice of application.
7. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed
conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same
manner as any term or condition of the permit or enforced in any manner
specifically prescribed by the City of Liberty Lake.
8. If the City of Liberty Lake’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not
include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the
proposal, the City of Liberty Lake should evaluate the threshold determination to
assure consistency with section 197-11-340(3)(a) WAC (withdrawal of DNS).
9. The City of Liberty Lake’s written response under this section shall not be
construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion
of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for
early notice, shall not bind the City of Liberty Lake to consider the clarifications
or changes in its threshold determination.

197-11-460 ISSUANCE OF FEIS
B. Preparation of EIS – Additional Consideration.
1. Preparation of the Draft and Final EIS (DEIS and FEIS) and a Draft and Final
Supplemental EIS (SEIS) is the responsibility of the lead agency under the
direction of the responsible official. No matter who participates in the preparation
of the EIS, it is the EIS of the City of Liberty Lake. The responsible official shall
be satisfied that the EIS complies with the provisions of this section and Chapter
197-11 WAC before issuing the EIS.
2. The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by the City of Liberty
Lake staff, the applicant or its agent, or by an outside consultant retained by
either an applicant or the lead agency.
a. For public projects, the responsible official shall determine when an
outside consultant should prepare the EIS based on available staff,
expertise, resources and public interest to adequately assess and
evaluate the impacts of the projects.
b. For projects initiated by a private applicant, the preparation of an EIS
shall be under the direction of the responsible official. The responsible
official shall notify the applicant of the procedures for an EIS preparation,
including approval of the DEIS, FEIS, and SEIS prior to distribution. All
costs of preparing the EIS shall be borne by the applicant.
3. If a person other than the lead agency is preparing the EIS, the responsible
official shall:
a. assure that the EIS is prepared in a responsible manner and with
appropriate methodology;
b. be responsible for scoping and preparation of a scoping report pursuant
to section 197-11-408 WAC (the responsible official may include
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-11
consultants in the scoping process);
c. coordinate any areas of research and examination to be undertaken, as
well as the organization of the resulting document
d. meet with the persons preparing the EIS and review draft sections of the
EIS to assure the completeness, accuracy, and objectivity of the EIS;
e. allow any person preparing an EIS access to all relevant public records
of the lead agency, pursuant to Chapter 42.17 RCW (Public Disclosure
and Public Records Law);
f. assist in obtaining any information on file with another agency that is
needed by the person preparing the EIS.
4. The lead agency may require an applicant to provide information the lead agency
does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not
required to supply information that is not required under this ordinance or that is
being requested from another agency. (This does not apply to information the
lead agency may request under another ordinance or statute.)
5. Any person, firm, or corporation assisting in the preparation of an EIS for private
projects shall have expertise and experience in preparing environmental impact
statements and shall be approved in writing by the responsible official before
participating in the EIS process. The lead agency may create and maintain an
EIS list of Qualified Consultants to assist in determining the expertise and
experience of consultants using, but not limited to, the following procedures.
a. Annually or biannually placing a legal notice in the City’s official
newspaper requesting Statement of Qualifications (SOQ). Interested
consultants will be required to submit an application package for
consideration to be placed on the list.
b. The City of Liberty Lake will review the SOQs and place those
consultant firms who are determined to meet the minimum
qualifications on the list. Those qualifications include, but are not limited
to:
i. possessing a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the
procedural and substantive requirements of SEPA and related
regulations;
ii. possessing adequate technical and administrative capacity to
produce EIS documents and/or associated technical
documents;
6. The private applicant shall compensate the lead agency for its administrative
costs incurred with the development, production, and processing of the EIS, in
accordance with the adopted City Fee Schedule.
C. Additional Elements To Be Covered In An EIS.
1. The table of contents shall include the list of elements of the environment
(section 197-11-444 WAC), indicating those elements or portions of elements
that do not involve significant adverse impacts (reference section 197-11-
440[3][b] WAC).
2. The lead agency may include, at its discretion, in an EIS or its appendix, the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-12
analysis of any impact relevant to the agency's decision, whether or not the
impact is an environmental one. The inclusion of such analysis may or may not
be based upon comments received during the scoping process. The provision
for combining documents may be used (section 197-11-640 WAC). The EIS shall
comply with the format requirements of sections 197-11-400 through 197-11-500
WAC. The decision whether to include such information and the adequacy of any
such additional analysis shall not be used in determining whether an EIS meets
the requirements of SEPA.
3. If the lead agency chooses to include a cost/benefit analysis in an EIS, such
analysis shall be consistent with section 197-11-450 WAC.
10-6A-5 Commenting

appeals of decisions or actions conditioned or denied on the basis of SEPA by a
non elected official shall be appealable in accordance with Section 10-6A-7,
subsection "C" below.
C. Appeals.
1. The City of Liberty Lake establishes the following appeal procedures under
section 43.21C.060, 43.21C.075, and 43.21C.080 RCW and section 197-11-680
WAC. Persons considering either administrative or judicial appeal of any
decision that involves SEPA are advised to read these statutory and
administrative rule provisions.
2. Appeal of the intermediate steps under SEPA (e.g., lead agency determination,
scoping, draft EIS adequacy) shall not be allowed.
3. Appeals of SEPA procedures shall be limited to review of a final threshold
determination (DS, DNS or Mitigated DNS) or Final EIS. These appeals may
occur prior to the City of Liberty Lake’s final decision on a proposed action.
4. Only one administrative appeal of a threshold determination or of the adequacy
of an EIS is allowed; successive administrative appeals within the City are not
allowed. This limitation does not apply to administrative appeals before another
agency. This limitation also does not apply to closed record appeals authorized
in subsection C-5 below.
5. A closed record appeal is allowed to the City Council of any decision by the City
of Liberty Lake Hearing Examiner conditioning or denying a proposal under
authority of SEPA, if the Hearing Examiner’s decision on the underlying
governmental action is subject to a closed record appeal to the City Council. The
appeal shall be consolidated with any appeal of the underlying governmental
action.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-17
6. Except as provided in subsection C-5 and C-7, any allowed appeals of
procedural and substantive determinations under SEPA shall be consolidated
with a hearing on, or appeal of, the underlying governmental action in a single
open record hearing before the City of Liberty Lake Hearing Examiner. The
hearing or appeal shall be one at which the City of Liberty Lake Hearing
Examiner will render a decision on the proposed action. For example, an appeal
of the adequacy of an EIS must be consolidated with a hearing on or appeal of
the City of Liberty Lake’s decision on the proposed action, if both proceedings
are allowed in the City’s procedures. If the City of Liberty Lake’s procedures do
not provide for a hearing on or appeal of the underlying governmental action,
such agency shall not hold a SEPA administrative appeal, except as allowed in
subsection C-7 below.
7. The following appeals of SEPA procedural or substantive determinations shall
not be consolidated with a hearing on or appeal of the underlying action

conduct its review under SEPA, including any appeals of its procedural
determinations, prior to submitting an application for a project permit.
Subsequent appeals of substantive determinations by an agency with
jurisdiction over the proposed project shall be allowed under the SEPA
appeal procedures of the agency with jurisdiction.
c. An appeal of a procedural determination made by the City of Liberty Lake
on a nonproject action.
d. An appeal where the underlying action is a ministerial permit decision
that does not require a public hearing.
8. For threshold determinations issued prior to a decision on a project action, any
administrative appeal allowed under Section 10-6A-7, subsection "C" shall be
filed within fourteen (14) days after the determination has been made and is
appealable. Any administrative appeal of a procedural or substantive
determination under SEPA issued at the same time as the decision on the project
action shall be filed within fourteen (14) days after notice of the decision has
been made and is appealable. In order to allow public comment on a DNS prior
to requiring an administrative appeal to be filed, this appeal period shall be
extended for an additional seven (7) days if the appeal is of a DNS for which
public comment period is required under the provisions of this ordinance or
chapter 197-11 WAC. Nothing in this subsection alters the requirements of
Section 10-6A-7, subsections "C-6 and C-7".
9. Procedural determinations made by the responsible official shall be entitled to
substantial weight in any appeal proceeding.
10. For any appeal under this section, the City of Liberty Lake shall provide for the
preparation of a record for use in any subsequent appeal proceedings, which
record shall consist at a minimum the following.
a. Findings and conclusions.
b. Testimony undero ath.
c. A taped, electronically recorded, or written transcript.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-18

comply with section 43.21C.075 RCW and section 197-11-680(4) WAC.

680(5) WAC of the date and place for commencing a judicial appeal if
there is a time limit established by statute or such agency’s regulations
for commencing a judicial appeal of the underlying governmental action.
b. Pursuant to section 43.21C.080 RCW, notice of any action taken by the
City of Liberty Lake may be publicized by such agency or the applicant
for, or the proponent of, such action. The form of the notice shall

10-6B-1 General Provisions
A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to implement the overall critical areas goals, and
the specific goals and policies for wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat, geo-hazard areas,
and critical aquifer recharge areas contained in the City of Liberty Lake Comprehensive
Plan, Chapter 9 Natural Environment. The specific goals for wetlands, fish and wildlife
habitat, geo- hazard areas, and critical aquifer recharge areas are listed below.
Furthermore, it is expressly the purpose of this article to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the general public.
1. Wetlands.
a. Ensure “no net loss” of wetland functions, value, and quantity as a result
of land use activities and establish a long-term goal of measurable gain
of wetlands function and value;
b. Establish wetland management programs that include identification of
wetlands and a classification system; and
c. Protect and enhance wetlands so that they are able to perform their
natural functions and maintain their beneficial values.
2. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas.
a. Identify fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and their ecosystems.
Recognize the multiple values of fish and wildlife habitat conservation
areas and educate people as to these values.
b. Protect, maintain, and improve critical fish and wildlife habitat
conservation areas and habitats of local importance through a variety of
methods including public ownership of the most critical areas and
incentives for privately owned land.
c. The City of Liberty Lake shall strive to minimize fragmentation of habitat
by protecting important fish and wildlife areas and open space; and by
interconnecting corridors to form a continuous network of fish and wildlife
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-27
habitat and ecosystems with adjacent areas.
d. The City of Liberty Lake shall strive to ensure that priority fish and wildlife
species as identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife
and species of local importance do not become imperiled due to land use
changes, habitat alteration, and other human activities.
3. Geologically HazardousA reas.
a. Development should be discouraged in geologically hazardous areas
unless it can be demonstrated that a hazard area can be developed
consistent with public health and safety. Development permits may be
conditioned to mitigate certain hazards.
b. Geologically hazardous areas may be used as open space for recreation,
rangeland, forest, wildlife habitat, and other uses as appropriate.
4. Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas.
a. Prevent degradation of groundwater quality in Liberty Lake area
aquifers.
b. Protect groundwater quality from development impacts.
c. Mitigate the effects of natural or un-natural events that lower aquifer
water quality below minimum state standards.
d. Secure adequate water quantity for the residents of the City of Liberty
Lake without artificially over-allocating available resources to any single
customer or group of customers.
e. Provide public information programs for land users to demonstrate how
to protect critical aquifer recharge areas from degradation.
f. Consistently enforce regulations, effectively monitor compliance, and
provide regulatory incentives to protect critical aquifer recharge areas.
g. Regularly update critical aquifer recharge area protection measures so
they are effective, enforceable, and equitable.
5. General purpose of this article.
a. To protect the public health, safety, and welfare by preserving, protecting,
restoring and managing through the regulation of development and other
activities within wetland, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas,
geologically hazardous areas and critical aquifer recharge areas;
b. To recognize wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and
geologically hazardous areas and critical aquifer recharge areas as
important natural resources which provide significant environmental
functions and values including: vital importance to critical fish and wildlife
habitat, surface and ground water quality, aquifer recharge, flood control,
shoreline anchorage and erosion control, scientific research and
education, open space, aesthetic values, historic and cultural
preservation, passive recreation and contribute to quality of life currently
enjoyed by citizens of Liberty Lake;
c. To maintain consistency with state and federal protective measures;
d. To avoid duplication and over-regulation by limiting regulatory
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-28
applicability to those developments and activities with significant impacts;
e. To identify and protect wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation
areas, geologically hazardous areas and critical aquifer recharge areas
without violating any citizen’s constitutional rights;
f. To alert appraisers, assessors, owners and potential buyer or lessees of
property to the development limitation within wetlands, fish and wildlife
habitat conservation areas, and geologically hazardous areas;
g. To prevent degradation of critical aquifer recharge areas.
B. Intent.
1. The intent of these regulations is to avoid, or in appropriate circumstances, to
minimize, rectify, reduce or compensate for impacts arising from land
development and other activities affecting wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat
conservation areas, geologically hazardous areas, and critical aquifer recharge
areas; and to maintain and enhance the biological and physical functions and
values of these areas.
2. Development shall not impact wetlands, however, if impacts do occur, mitigation
may be implemented to achieve no net loss of wetlands in terms of acreage,
function, and value.
3. It is recognized that land development will not always be compatible with
preservation of fish and wildlife and their habitats. Some wildlife will be eliminated
as development occurs. It is the intent of these regulations to preserve wildlife
when possible through thoughtful planning and consideration of wildlife needs.
4. It is the intent of these regulations to allow development in geo-hazard areas
only when hazards can be mitigated to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
5. In addition, the intent of these regulations is to recognize that property rights and
public services are an essential component of our legal and economic
environment. Where such rights and public services are seriously compromised
by the regulations contained in this article, impacts may be permitted provided
there is appropriate mitigation.
C. Applicability. This article shall apply to all areas within the City of Liberty Lake and the
obligation to comply with any requirements within the scope and provisions of this article
is with the owner of the property or land. No action shall be undertaken by any person
which impacts critical aquifer recharge areas or results in any alteration of a wetland,
fish and wildlife habitat or geologically hazardous area as defined in this Code except in
conformance with this article. Uses and activities listed in subsection "D" below are
allowed in wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat areas, geologically hazardous areas and
their buffer areas only if:
1. The use or activity is in compliance with the requirements of this article, and
2. The use or activity is in compliance with all other applicable provisions of the City
Code. Uses and activities listed in listed in subsection "D" below shall conform
with requirements in this article for protecting critical aquifer recharge areas.

10-6B-2 Emergency Permits & Reasonable Use Exceptions
A. Emergency Activities - Temporary Emergency Permit.
1. Criteria for Granting a Temporary Emergency Permit. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this article or any other laws to the contrary, the Zoning
Administrator may issue a temporary emergency wetlands permit or allow
regulated uses or activities in a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or
geologically hazardous area if:
a. The Zoning Administrator determines that an imminent threat to public
health, safety, or the environment will occur if an emergency permit is not
granted; and
b. The threat or loss may occur before a wetlands permit or fish and wildlife
habitat conservation area review can be issued or conditioned under the
procedures otherwise required by this article.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-33
2. Conditions of Emergency Permit. Any emergency permit granted shall:

emergency activity, not to exceed ninety days without re-application; and
c. Require the restoration of any wetland, fish and wildlife habitat
conservation area or geologically hazardous area altered as a result of
the emergency activity within ninety days following the emergency repair,
or during the growing season after the emergency repair.
B. Reasonable EUxscee ption.
1. Requirements. If an applicant for a development proposal demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that application of the standards of this
article would deny all reasonable use of the property, development as
conditioned shall be allowed. The applicant shall pay a fee, as established in the
adopted City Fee Schedule, which may cover mailing and processing and submit
documentation on forms provided by City demonstrating all of the following to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator:

off the property; and
d. Any alteration to the wetland, fish and wildlife habitat, or geo-hazard area
is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property;
and
e. The inability of the applicant to derive reasonable use is not the result of
actions by the applicant in subdividing the property or adjusting boundary
lines thereby creating the undevelopable condition after the effective date
this Code.
2. Decision. The Zoning Administrator shall include findings on each of the evaluation
criteria listed above in a written decision. The written decision shall be mailed to
the applicant and adjacent property owners, including property owners across
public rights-of-way or private easements. The written decision shall include
conditions necessary to serve the purposes of the article and shall provide an
appeal procedure as contained in Section 10-6B-1, subsections "H" and "I" of this

would restrict regulated activities as defined by this article to an area of
the property where no significant effect on the wetland is likely;
b. The building envelope(s) shall be recorded on the property with the
Spokane County auditor’s office that contain such restrictions to ensure
compliance with this article;
c. A statement shall be recorded on the property which contains the
following language “The property is subject to building envelope
restrictions which were placed on the property to protect wetland and
wetland buffer areas. An actual wetland determination, wetland boundary
determination, wetland rating, and wetlands report as provided for in this
article has not been completed and the property owner is subject to the
provisions of this article.”
d. The Zoning Administrator, in modifying the requirement for a wetland
report shall consider but not be limited to the following: i) evidence of the
wetland location; ii) the proposal and its proximity to the wetland and

d. Category 4 wetlands, minimum wetland buffer area width is twenty-five
feet.
2. Increased Wetland Buffer Area Width. The City may require increased buffer
area widths on a case-by-case basis by the Zoning Administrator when a larger
buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values. This determination
shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably
related to protection of the functions and values of the wetland. The
documentation must include but not be limited to the following criteria:
a. The wetland is used by a plant or animal species listed by the federal
government or the state as endangered, threatened, candidate,
sensitive, monitored, or documented priority species or habitats, or
essential or outstanding habitat for those species or has unusual nesting
or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or
b. The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control
measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or
c. The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than
thirty percent.
3. Reduction of Standard Wetland Buffer Area Width. The department may reduce
the standard wetland buffer area width on a case-by-case basis by the Zoning
Administrator where it can be demonstrated that:
a. The adjacent land has a high quality vegetative buffer, has less than
fifteen percent slopes, and no direct or indirect, short-term or long-term,
adverse impacts to wetlands will result from a regulated activity. The City
may require long-term monitoring of the project and subsequent
corrective actions if adverse impacts to wetlands are discovered; or
b. The project includes a buffer enhancement plan using native vegetation
which substantiates that an enhanced buffer will improve the functional
attributes of the buffer to provide additional protection for wetland
functions and values. An enhanced buffer shall not result in greater than
a twenty-five percent reduction in the buffer width or be less than twentyfive
feet.
4. Standard Buffer Width Averaging. Standard wetland buffer areas may be
modified by averaging buffer widths or a combination of averaging and reduction.
Wetland buffer width averaging shall be allowed only when all of the following
apply:
a. Averaging will provide the necessary biological, chemical, and physical
support necessary to protect the wetland in question, taking into account
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-39
the type, intensity, scale, and landscape location of the proposed land
use;
b. The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical
characteristics which justify the averaging;
c. The land uses causing the least disturbance would be located adjacent
to areas where the buffer width is reduced, and that such land uses are
guaranteed in perpetuity by covenant, deed restriction, easement, or
other legally binding mechanism;
d. Width averaging will not adversely impact the wetland’s functions and
values;
e. The total area contained within the wetland buffer after averaging is no
less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging. In
no instance shall the buffer width be reduced by more than fifty percent
of the standard buffer or be less than twenty-five feet.
5. Wetland Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified, wetland buffer
areas shall be retained in their natural condition. Where buffer disturbances have
occurred, revegetation with native vegetation shall be required.
6. Permitted Uses in a Wetland Buffer Area. Regulated activities shall not be
allowed in a buffer area except for the following:
a. Activities having minimal adverse impacts on buffers and no adverse
impacts on wetlands. These may include low intensity, passive
recreational activities such as pedestrian/bike trails which should be
setback fifty feet from the wetland boundary if possible and shall be a
maximum of fourteen feet in width, nonpermanent wildlife watching
blinds, short term scientific or education activities, and sports fishing or
hunting (refer to Section 10-6B-1, subsection "D").
b. Motorized vehicles shall not be allowed in wetland buffer areas except as
part of an approved mitigation plan or permitted activity such as noxious
weed control.
D. Wetland Mitigation.
1. Mitigation Options. New development shall not impact wetlands and permits
shall not be conditioned to allow for wetland impact. Wetland alteration from
development or other activities should not cause adverse impacts to the wetland
or its buffer area. If adverse impacts do occur, restoration, creation, or
enhancement of the wetlands will be made to offset the impacts. An appropriate
mitigation plan shall be prepared that provides for mitigation measures as
outlined below. Wetland mitigation means the use of any or all of the following
actions listed in descending order of preference:
a. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking certain action or parts of an
action;
b. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and
its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking
affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;
c. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-40
environment;
d. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and
maintenance operations during the life of the action;
e. Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing
substitute resources or environments; or
f. Monitoring the impact and the compensation project and taking
appropriate corrective measures. Mitigation may include a combination
of the above measures.
2. Wetlands Mitigation Ratios. Any person who degrades wetlands shall restore,
create, or enhance equivalent areas or greater areas of wetlands than those
altered in order to compensate for loss of wetland acreage or functions according
to the following ratios:
Category Wetland Area
Impacted
Wetland Replacement
Area Required
Category I 1 to 6
Category II or III
Forested 1 to 3
Scrub-shrub 1 to 3
Emergent 1 1.5
Category IV 1 to 1.25
3. Wetland Enhancement. Any person who degrades wetlands may propose to
enhance existing wetlands in order to compensate for wetland losses. Proposals
to enhance wetlands shall identify how enhancement conforms to the overall
goals and requirements of the wetlands protection program. A wetlands
enhancement compensation project shall be considered, provided that
enhancement for one function and value will not degrade another function or
value. Acreage replacement ratios may be increased up to one hundred percent
to recognize existing functional values. Category I wetlands shall not be
enhanced.
4. Increased Replacement Ratio. The standard replacement ratio may be
increased under the following circumstances:
a. High degree of uncertainty as to the probable success of the proposed
restoration or creation;
b. Significant period of time between destruction and replication of wetland
functions;
c. Projected losses in functional value and other uses, such as recreation,
scientific research, and education, are relatively high;
d. Not possible to create or restore same type of wetland;
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-41
e. Off-site compensation is offered.
5. Decreased Replacement Ratio. The standard replacement ratio may be
decreased under the following circumstances:
a. Scientifically supported evidence which demonstrates that no net loss of
wetland function or value is attained under the decreased ratio.
b. In all cases a minimum acreage replacement ratio of 1:1 shall be
required.
6. In-Kind/Out-Of-Kind Mitigation. In-kind mitigation shall be provided except when
the following apply:
a. The wetland system is already degraded and out-of-kind replacement will
result in a wetland with greater functional value; or
b. Technical problems such as exotic vegetation and changes in watershed
hydrology make implementation of in-kind mitigation impossible. Where
out-of- kind replacement is accepted, greater acreage replacement ratios
may be required to compensate for lost functional values.
7. On-Site/Off-Site Mitigation. On-site mitigation shall be provided except when the
following apply:
a. The hydrology and ecosystem of the original wetland and those who
benefit from the hydrology and ecosystem will not be damaged by the onsite
loss; and
b. On-site mitigation is not scientifically feasible due to problems with
hydrology, soils, or factors such as other potentially adverse impacts from
surrounding land uses; or
c. Existing functional values at the site of the proposed restoration are
significantly greater than lost wetland functional values; or
d. Established goals for flood storage, flood conveyance, habitat, or other
wetland functions have been established and strongly justify location of
mitigation measures at another site.
8. Mitigation Outside of Primary Drainage Basin. Wetland creation or restoration
shall occur within the same primary drainage basin as the wetland loss occurred,
unless the applicant can demonstrate that:
a. The hydrology and ecosystem of the original wetland and those who
benefit from the hydrology and ecosystem will not be substantially
damaged by the loss within that primary drainage basin; and
b. In-basin mitigation is not scientifically feasible due to problems with
hydrology, soils, or other factors such as other potentially adverse
impacts from surrounding land uses; or
c. Existing functional values in a different primary drainage basin are
significantly greater than lost wetland functional values; or
d. Established goals for flood storage, flood conveyance, habitat, or other
wetland functions have been established and strongly justify location of
mitigation measures in a different primary drainage basin.
9. Mitigation Site Selection. In selecting mitigation sites, applicants shall pursue
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-42
siting in the following order of preference:
a. Upland sites which were formerly wetlands;
b. Degraded upland sites generally having bare ground or vegetative cover
consisting primarily of exotic introduced species, weeds, or emergent
vegetation; and
c. Other upland sites.
10. Timing of Mitigation. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce
impacts to existing wildlife and flora.
11. Components of Mitigation Plans. All wetland restoration, creation, and/or
enhancement projects required pursuant to this article shall follow a mitigation
plan which meets City requirements. The Zoning Administrator must give written
approval for a mitigation plan prior to commencement of any wetland restoration,
creation, or enhancement activity. The mitigation plan shall contain at least the
following components:
a. Baseline Information. A written assessment and accompanying maps of
the impacted wetland including, at a minimum, wetland delineation;
existing wetland acreage; wetland impacts; vegetative, faunal, and
hydrologic characteristics; soil and substrate conditions; and topographic
elevations. If the mitigation site is different from the impacted wetland
site, baseline information should also include: the watershed; surface
hydrology; existing and proposed adjacent land uses; proposed buffers;
and ownership.
b. Environmental Goals and Objectives. A written report shall be provided
identifying goals and objectives and describing; site selection criteria;
mitigation goals; target evaluation species and resource functions; dates
for beginning and completion; and a complete description of the functions
and values sought in the new wetland. The goals and objectives shall be
related to the functions and values of the original wetland, or if out-ofkind,
the type of wetland to be emulated. The report shall also include an
analysis of the likelihood of success of the mitigation project at duplicating
the original wetland, and the long-term viability of the project, based on
the experiences of comparable projects, if any.
c. Monitoring Program. Specific measurable criteria approved by the Zoning
Administrator, shall be provided for evaluating whether the goals and
objectives of the project are being achieved, and for determining when
and if remedial action or contingency measures should be implemented.
Such criteria may include water quality standards, survival rates of
planted vegetation, species abundance and diversity targets, habitat
diversity indices, or other ecological, geological or hydrological criteria.
The mitigation plan manager will assure work is completed in accordance
with the mitigation plan and, if necessary, the contingency plan. The
monitoring program will continue for five years after the completion of the
project and be bonded with results of the monitoring data being reported
to the Zoning Administrator.
d. Detailed Construction Plans. Written specifications and descriptions of
mitigation techniques shall be provided, as specified by the Zoning
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 - Chapter 6 Page 6-43
Administrator.
e. Construction Oversight. The construction of the mitigation project will be
monitored to insure that the project fulfills its goals.
f. Contingency Plan. The plan must identify potential courses of action that
can be taken when monitoring or evaluation indicates project
performance standards are not being met.
g. Permit Conditions. Any mitigation plan prepared pursuant to this article
shall become part of the wetland permit application.
h. Consultation with Other Agencies. Applicants are encouraged to consult
with federal, state, and local agencies having expertise or interest in a
mitigation proposal.
E. Protection of Wetlands and Wetland Buffer Areas.
1. Easements, Title Notices, Plat Dedications. Separate tract(s) containing
wetland(s) and/or wetland buffer areas may be required to be created. Wetland
or wetland buffer areas shall be protected by one or more of the following
methods:
a. A conservation easement or deed restriction prohibiting alteration and
requiring protection of native vegetation within a wetland or wetland
buffer area may be dedicated to the City of Liberty Lake or other public
or non-profit entities (e.g., land trusts) specified by the City
b. A title notice shall be recorded on the property or portion of the property
containing a wetland or wetland buffer area. The title notice shall provide
notice of a wetland delineation, if any exists, or indicate location of
wetlands or wetland buffer areas on the property. A required title notice
shall prohibit in perpetuity the development, alteration, or disturbance of
vegetation within the wetland or wetland buffer area except when in
conformance with this article.
c. Any land division which requires the recording of a final plat shall provide
on the face of such plat the boundary of such wetland and wetland buffer
area with a reference to separately recorded conservation easements,
title notices, or deed restrictions as appropriate. Subdivisions with tracts
of land which are equal to or greater than five acres may provide for
building envelopes as provided in Section 10-6B-3, subsection "A".
d. Regardless of the method chosen to protect and preserve the wetland or
wetland buffer area, such areas shall be maintained by the land owner,
adjacent lot owner(s), home owner’s association, the permit applicant or
agent, or an appropriate entity as approved by the City.
2. Access Limitations, Signs, Fencing, and Best Management Practices. Access to
wetlands and wetland buffer areas will normally be allowed, subject to unique
conditions which warrant access limitations:
a. The perimeter of the wetland and wetland buffer areas to be disturbed
pursuant to an approved wetland permit or authorization shall be marked
in the field, inspected by the review authority prior to the commencement
of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained
throughout the duration of the development activity;

10-6B-4 Fish & Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas
A. Priority Habitats and Species Designation. Washington State Priority Habitat and Species
Program. The priority habitats and species of the City of Liberty Lake are identified in below and
are adopted from the Washington State Priority Habitats and Species Program, as now or
hereafter amended. Due to the dynamic nature of fish and wildlife populations and their habitats,
the priority habitats and species program will be revised periodically as species and habitats
are added, deleted or redefined. The location of these priority habitats and known point locations
such as den or nest site of priority species are depicted on the City of Liberty Lake fish and
wildlife conservation areas map, as applicable.
Priority Habitats and Species of the City of Liberty Lake
Priority Habitat Criteria
Wetlands and Deepwater
Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the
water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by
shallow water. Wetlands must have all of the following characteristics:
(1) the land supports predominantly hydrophytic plants, (2) soil are
hydric and (3) soils are saturated with water or covered by the shallow
water at some time during the growing season of each year.
Deep water habitats are permanently flooded lands lying below the deep
water boundary of wetlands. Deep water habitats include environments
where surface water is permanent and often deep, so that water, rather
than air is the principal medium within which the dominant organisms
live.
Wetlands and deep water habitats support comparatively high wildlife
density and diversity, provide breeding habitat and seasonal ranges,
have limited availability and high vulnerability to habitat alteration.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐47
Riparian
Riparian habitat is defined as an area adjacent to flowing water that
contains elements of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems which
mutually influence each other. In riparian habitat, the vegetation, water
tables, soils, micro climate and wildlife inhabitants of terrestrial
ecosystems are influenced by perennial or intermittent water, and the
biological and physical properties of the adjacent aquatic ecosystems are
influenced by adjacent vegetation, nutrient and sediment loading,
terrestrial wildlife and organic debris from the land.
Riparian areas have high wildlife density and high species diversity. They
serve as important wildlife breeding and seasonal ranges. They are
important movement corridors and are highly vulnerable to habitat
alteration.
Cliffs/Bluffs
Greater than 25 feet high and below 5,000 feet elevation. These areas
are significant for wildlife breeding habitat, have limited availability and
support unique assemblages of species.
Old Growth Forest
Tree stands are highly variable in species composition and structural
characteristics due to the influence of fire, climate and soil. In general,
stands will be > than 150 years old, with 10 trees per acre > 21” dbh and
1-3 snags per acre > 12-14” diameter. Downed logs may vary from
abundant to absent. Canopies may be single or multilayered. Evidence
of human-caused alterations to the stand will be absent or so slight as to
not affect the ecosystem structures and functions.
Old growth forests have high wildlife density and diversity. They are
important for breeding habitat and seasonal ranges. Old growth forests
are limited and declining and have a high vulnerability to habitat
alteration.
Urban Natural Open Space
A priority species resides within or is adjacent to the open space, and
uses it for breeding and/or regular feeding. This habitat may also function
as a corridor connecting other priority habitat areas, especially those that
would otherwise be isolated; and/or the open space is an isolated
remnant of natural habitat larger than 10 acres and is surrounded by
urban development. Local consideration may be given to open space
areas smaller than 10 acres.
Urban Natural Open Space has comparatively high wildlife density and
diversity, is important as a breeding habitat and is important as a
movement corridor. These areas have limited availability and have a high
vulnerability to habitat alteration.
Steppe
Relatively undisturbed areas as indicated by the dominance of native
plants where grasses and forbs form the natural climax plant community.
Steppe habitat has relatively high wildlife density and diversity, is
important wildlife breeding habitat and important for seasonal range. This
habitat has limited availability, high vulnerability to habitat alteration and
supports unique and dependent species.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐48
Shrub-Steppe
Large areas of relatively unfragmented shrub-steppe habitat, greater
than 640 acres, should have a substantial amount of interior habitat.
They should also contain a variety of habitat features (e.g., variety of
topography, riparian areas, canyons, habitat edges, plant communities).
Blocks should be relatively undisturbed, as indicated by a dominance of
native vegetation. Portions may contain disturbed habitat.
Shrub-steppe habitat supports comparatively high wildlife density and
diversity, provides important wildlife breeding habitat and important
seasonal ranges. This habitat has limited availability, high vulnerability to
alteration and supports unique and dependent species.
White-tailed Deer
Winter Range
Winter range is determined by a combination of factors: elevation,
slope, aspect, snow depth, browse quality and quantity, presence of
closed canopy mature forests, temperatures and traditional deer
movement patterns.
Closed canopies of mature forests along streams are extremely
important whitetail habitat.
Moose habitat
Aquatic feeding sites are found in areas of slow moving water, ponds,
swamps and pot holes which contain abundant submergent and
emergent vegetation. Larger aquatic areas are preferred. These sites
are characterized by a broad zone of hiding cover around the perimeter
of the feeding site.
Calving sites are characterized by roadless blocks of mature timber of
80 acres or greater which provide hiding cover and are adjacent to good
forage where human disturbance is minimal.
Elk Habitat
Generally, the winter and summer ranges of a herd of elk are
geographically separate. In eastern Washington, winter range consists
of shrub-steppe, bunch grass of shrub plant communities adjacent to
forest zones.
Special features of elk habitat include corridors and wallows. These
features are characterized by screening vegetation and lack
disturbance. During hunting season elk seek the largest cover patches
in their range. At other times of the year, smaller cover patches within
600 feet of forage areas are most important.
Wildlife Corridors
Wildlife corridors are landscape feature that facilitate the biologically
effective transport of animals between larger patches of habitat
dedicated to conservation functions. Such corridors may facilitate
several kinds of traffic including frequent foraging movements, seasonal
migrations or the once in a lifetime dispersal of juvenile animals. These
are transitional habitats and need not contain all the habitat elements
required for the long term survival or reproduction of its migrants.
Landscape Linkages
Landscape linkages differ from a movement corridor in that the
complete range of community and ecosystem processes continue to
operate within it through time. Plants and smaller animals are able to
move between larger landscapes over a period of generations.

B. Regulated Uses and Activities in Priority Habitats.
1. For the purposes of this article, the City of Liberty Lake may restrict the regulated uses
and activities shown in Section 10-6B-1, subsection "D" which lie within a priority habitat
by definition or within one-quarter mile of a point location (den or nest site) of a non-game
priority species through the application of the performance standards contained in
Section 10-6B-4, subsection "C" below.
2. In cases where differences in regulations occur because of overlapping priority
habitats or buffer areas, the regulation which provides the greatest degree of
protection shall apply.
C. Performance Standards for Regulated Uses and Activities.
1. A management plan, if required, will be used by the City of Liberty Lake to evaluate
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐51
the impact of a use or activity on a priority habitat or species and may require
mitigating measures to protect fish and wildlife based on the management plan
recommendations.
2. Riparian Habitat Performance Standards.
a. Except as otherwise specified, riparian areas shall be retained in their natural
condition. Riparian vegetation in buffer areas shall not be removed except in the
case of fire or disease unless there is no alternative. For lots or parcels with
water frontage on type 2 or 3 waters, one view/access corridor to the ordinary
high water mark may be cleared of riparian vegetation as long as the
view/access corridor does not exceed a width of twenty-five feet.
b. Roads within riparian buffer areas shall be kept to a minimum and shall not run
parallel to the water body. Crossings where necessary, shall cross riparian areas
at as near right angles as possible. If no alternative exists to placement of a
roadway within a riparian area, mitigation may be required. Mitigation measures
shall be specified in a management plan and may include, but are not limited to:
i. Fencing of riparian buffer area to protect remaining vegetation; and
ii. Enhancement of remaining riparian buffer area through planting of native
vegetation. Water crossings must be approved by the Washington State
Department of Fish and Wildlife according to WAC 75.20.100.
c. Equestrian pedestrian/bike trails are permitted in riparian buffer areas but should
be set back fifty feet from the ordinary high water mark, if possible and shall be a
maximum of fourteen feet in width.
d. Off-road motorized vehicle use in riparian buffers areas is prohibited.
e. Riparian buffer areas shall be established from the ordinary high water mark.
Water bodies classified by the water typing system (WAC-222-16-030) or if
unclassified, as described below and in WAC-222-16-030, have the following
buffer area requirements:
Water Type, General Description (see WAC-222-16-030) Riparian Buffer
Type 1, Shorelines of Statewide Significance 250 feet

above by up to twenty-five percent if:
i. A riparian buffer area is fenced to prevent damage to vegetation by
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐52
livestock along its entire length; or
ii. A riparian buffer area is enhanced using native plants including trees and
shrubs according to a plan prepared in consultation with the Spokane
County soil conservation district and the Washington State Department
of Fish and Wildlife. The plan shall include numbers and species of
plants, a planting schedule and maintenance agreement to insure long
term survival.
g. The Zoning Administrator has the authority to increase the buffer widths shown
above by up to twenty-five percent on a case by case basis when a larger buffer
is necessary to protect the fish and wildlife using the stream and riparian area.
This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing
that the increased buffer width is reasonably related to the protection of the fish
and/or wildlife using the stream and riparian area as indicated by meeting one or
both of the following criteria:
i. The land adjacent to the water is susceptible to severe erosion and other
erosion control measures will not prevent adverse impacts.
ii. The land adjacent to the water has minimal vegetative cover or slopes
greater than thirty percent.
h. The Zoning Administrator has the authority to modify the standard buffer widths
by averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths shall be allowed only when
all of the following are demonstrated
i. Averaging will provide the necessary biological, chemical and physical
support necessary to protect the fish and wildlife using the riparian area
in question, taking into account the type, intensity, scale and location of
the proposed activity.
ii. The riparian area contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical
characteristics which justify the averaging;
iii. The land uses causing the least disturbance would be located adjacent
to areas where the buffer width is reduced and that such land uses are
guaranteed in perpetuity by covenant, deed restriction, easement or
other legally binding mechanism;
iv. The total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than
that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging.
3. Wetland habitat performance standards shall be according to the provisions of Section
10-6B-3.
4. All development proposals shall follow the bald eagle protection rules (RCW 77.12.655
and WAC 232.12.292), as now or hereafter amended, when the proposal is likely to
have a direct impact on the habitat of the bald eagle.
D. Habitat Management Plans. A habitat management plan shall be prepared for regulated uses
or activities (refer to Section 10-6B-1, subsection "D") which are located in a priority habitat or
within one-quarter mile of a non-game priority species point location (den or nest site) if it is
determined by the Zoning Administrator that the proposal is likely to have a significant adverse
impact on the priority habitat or species. The determination of a need for additional information
(habitat management plan) shall be made by the Zoning Administrator in consultation with the
Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife or other authority as determined by the

b. Soils identified by Natural Resource Conservation Service as having a severe
potential for erosion (see Section 10-6B-5, subsection "B" below);
c. Hydraulic factors such as existing on-site surface and groundwater or changes
in hydraulic factors, caused by proposals that create a severe potential for
erosion or landslide hazard;
d. Areas that historically have been prone to landsliding (areas adjacent to lakes,
streams, springs) or any one of the following geologic formations: alluvium,
landslide deposit, Latah formation;

f. Areas that are unstable as a result of rapid stream or stream bank erosion.
B. Building Site Development Water Erosion Hazard. Prepared July 1994 by: USDA-Natural
Resource Conservation Service Rock Pointe Tower II
316 W. Boone Ave., Suite 450, Spokane, WA. 99201-2348
Water erosion can be predicted or estimated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE).
The USLE equation estimates or predicts tons of soil loss per acre per year with the formula A
= RKLSCP
A = Estimate average annual erosion (tons/acre/yr.)
-------------------------
R = Rainfall factor (rainfall plus snow melt) K = Soil erodibility factor
L = Length of slope S = Percent slope
C = Cover factor (vegetation, mulch, etc.)
P = Conservation practices factor (terraces, etc.)
A modified version of USLE was used to estimate erosion hazard for building site development.
The C and P of the USLE equation are erosion management factors. Depending on the type of
management applied they have values from near zero (0) to one (1). The value 1 represents no
management applied that benefits erosion reduction.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐56
Management factors (C and P) are not used when identifying the erosion hazard of map units
for land use planning. This enables identification of the soil map units inherent erosion hazard
potential that can aid in planning.
R factor is related to how much rainfall occurs and when. The higher the annual precipitation
the higher the R factor. For the Spokane area an R of 54 was used.
K soil erodibility factor is the soils susceptibility of soil detachment by water. The soils K factor
is based on the relationship of five soil factors; 1) percent silt plus very fine sand, 2) percent
sand greater than 0.10 mm, 3) organic matter content, 4) soil structure, and 5) permeability. K
factor values range from 0.02 to 0.64.
L and S are used together and are referred to as the LS factor. The L part is the length of Slope,
which is the distance from a point of origin of overland flow to the point where the slope gradient
decreases enough that deposition begins or where runoff water enters a well-defined channel
that may be part of a drainage network. The S part is the percent slope between two points.
LS value is the relationship between the length of slope and steepness of slope. For example
LS for slope lengths of 50 feet are .76 at 8 percent slope, 1.01 at 12 percent slope, and 1.42 at
20 percent slopes (see table below).
The LS value is the value at the intersection of the length of slope and percent slope. Slope
length is the distance in feet of an uninterrupted uniform slope.
See Table, Section 10-6B-5, subsection "C" below
The Building Site Development Water Erosion Hazard Table was created using the modified
version of USLE. Soft loss from water erosion was calculated for various soil K factors at slope
groups of 0 to 8 percents, 8 to 15 percent and more than 15 percent. It is assumed that
construction will expose the soil surface for a period of 3 to 6 months.
Using the estimated erosion for the period of time the soil is exposed, an index based on K
factor and slope was calculated. This index is then used to assign erosion hazard ratings of
slight, moderate or severe. The index is a product of K times the average slope of the soil map
unit (K*ave slope). Slight has an index of less than or equal to 3.0 (less than 5 tons/acre/yr.),
moderate has an index of 3.0 to 4.0 (5 to 8 tons/acre/yr.), and severe has an index of greater
than 4.0 (greater than 8 tons/acre/yr.). Only soils with a severe rating are shown on the table
that follows.
The Building Site Development Water Erosion Hazard Table for Spokane County provides a
tool for broad land use planning and identifying areas with developmental concerns. The
information, however, has limitations. Because of the map scale, small areas of different soils
may be included within the mapped areas of a specific soil. The information is not site specific
and does not eliminate the need for on-site investigation of the soils.

D. Identification and Mapping. Data sources are available from the City of Liberty Lake that are
used in the mapping of the characteristics for geologically hazardous areas. The existing map
sources provide a general level of information and are not intended to pinpoint erosion or
landslide hazards on individual sites or properties. Specific information may be provided by the
applicant that indicates characteristics are not present on the site or that the proposal is not
located within nor will impact a geologically hazardous area. In addition, there may be areas not
designated on City maps that exhibit the characteristics of geologically hazardous areas. It is
the intent of this article to require all areas which meet the classification characteristics of
geologically hazardous areas to meet the requirements of this article. Lands that meet the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐61
classification characteristics for erosion and landslide hazard areas are mapped and used to
flag areas within the City that have a high probability to meet the classification characteristics.
The geologically hazardous areas maps shall be updated as more accurate information
becomes available to aid the public and project reviewers. Classification characteristics are
identified as follows:
1. Soil characteristics are identified as those areas containing soils which according to the
U.S. Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Classification System
may experience severe to very severe erosion based on a formula which is based on
several factors including rainfall, slope, soil erodibility and other factors. The formula and
a listing of soils which have a severe potential for erosion are listed in Section 10-6B-5,
subsection "B" above. Landslide hazard areas are based on a combination of geologic,
topographic (slope) and hydraulic factors and have a high susceptibility to landslides.
2. Geologic characteristics are areas identified and described by the Washington State
Department of Natural Resources and include:
a. Alluvium;
b. Landslide deposits;
c. Latah formation.
3. Topographic characteristics include areas with severe site topography or slopes of thirty
percent or greater and have a severe potential for erosion and/or landslide hazards.
4. Other Characteristics. Hydraulic features include surface and groundwater conditions
and the hydraulic changes resulting from a proposal. Uncompacted fill-areas or steepcuts
as a result of site grading, construction activities, or resource extraction.
E. Regulations. The following regulations shall be used when activities and uses as described in
Section 10-6B-1, subsection "D", are located within geo-hazard areas:
1. City of Liberty Lake Municipal Code Title 9 - Building Regulations.
2. City of Liberty Lake Municipal Code Title 10 - Development Code.
3. Applicable Flood Hazard Regulations.
4. If the regulations noted above do not provide adequate mitigation of impacts as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, then a geo-hazard mitigation plan prepared by
a qualified landslide or erosion specialist shall be required.
F. Geo-hazard Mitigation Plan and Geo-hazard Evaluation.
1. Geo-hazard Mitigation Plans. When the Zoning Administrator determines that the impact
of a use or activity located in a geo-hazard area cannot be mitigated through standards
identified in Section 10-6B-5, subsection "E" above, a geo-hazard mitigation plan shall
be prepared to identify construction standards for the proposal. Geo-hazard mitigation
plans shall conform to City guidelines for stormwater management or any subsequent
regulation adopted by the City of Liberty Lake providing erosion and landslide protection.
A geo-hazard mitigation plan, prepared by a qualified landslide or erosion specialist,
shall be prepared for building permits, road construction, utilities, and storm drainage
facility installations within a geo-hazard area.
2. Geo-hazard Evaluation, Preliminary Report. A geo-hazard evaluation or feasibility report
shall be prepared by a qualified landslide or erosion specialist and submitted with
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐62
applications for preliminary plats, short plats, PUDs, binding site plans; zone
reclassifications, conditional use permits, variances, manufactured home park site
plans, or top soil removal permits located in geologic hazard areas.
The geo-hazard evaluation shall document the extent and nature of geo-hazard on the
subject property and shall provide mitigating measures and an assessment of geohazards
associated with the proposal. A more detailed geo-hazard mitigation plan may
be required at the time of building permit application or actual construction approvals.
3. Subdivision Dedication Notice. Final subdivisions, short plats, and binding site plans
located within geo-hazard areas shall contain language in the plat dedication to indicate
lots or portions of lots that are affected by geo-hazards.
In addition, building setback lines may be drawn on lots, parcels, and tracts so as to
indicate suitable areas for construction of structures or improvements.
10-6B-6 Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas
The City of Liberty Lake designates areas and adopts development regulations for the purpose of
protecting areas within the City that are critical to maintaining ground water recharge and quality. This
section specifies the requirements to be enacted when regulated development within these areas is
proposed to occur. This section applies to any person, firm, or corporation, which establishes or
proposes to establish new, expanded, enlarged, or different land use or activity identified in Section 10-
6B-6, subsection "B" below, within designated critical aquifer recharge areas in the City of Liberty Lake.
A. Designation and Rating.
1. Critical aquifer recharge areas are those areas with a critical recharging effect on
aquifers used for potable water as defined by section 365-190-030(2) WAC. Critical
aquifer recharge areas have prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration
rates that create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or
contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water.
2. Aquifer recharge areas are rated as having a high, moderate, or low susceptibility based
on a scientific analysis of soils, hydraulic conductivity (the ease with which water moves
between the surface and aquifers), annual rainfall, the depth to aquifers, the importance
of the material between soils and aquifers (Vadose zone), and wellhead protection
information. See Section 10-6B-6, subsection "F", for an explanation of the aquifer
susceptibility map.
3. If a parcel lies within two or more susceptibility rating designations, the higher
susceptibility rating designation shall apply to the whole parcel.
4. Designated wellhead protection areas and areas within a one thousand-foot radius of
wells without reported plans, are additionally treated as high-susceptibility areas. As
wellhead protection plans are completed for wells, the one thousand-foot radius
placeholder will be replaced by the Washington State Department of Health-certified
wellhead protection area.
B. Uses and Activities Regulated in Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. The table below establishes
the following uses and activities regulated by the requirements of this section. This table should
be interpreted with the corresponding performance standards set forth in Section 10-6B-6,

F. Explanation of Aquifer Susceptibility Map - SHADI.
A method for assessing ground water susceptibility in Spokane County. Introduction.
In the language of water resources management the term vulnerability describes the potential
risk for the contamination of an aquifer. Vulnerability depends on two factors: aquifer
susceptibility (the level of ground water protection provided by the natural environment) and the
pollution potential (land use activities above the aquifer). This document describes the
development and application of a susceptibility model for Spokane County.
The SHADI ground water susceptibility model is based on the same general approach as the
DRASTIC model. DRASTIC is a model developed by the National Water Well Association in
cooperation with the U.S. EPA (Aller, L., et al, 1987). DRASTIC has been used in its original
and modified form in most areas of the United States (Swanson, R., 1994; Palmquist, R., 1991).
The SHADI modification developed for use in Spokane County uses the following five
environmental characteristics to assess susceptibility:
Soil Media
Hydraulic Conductivity Annual Recharge Depth to Ground Water
Importance of the Vadose Zone
To use the SHADI model data, each of the five characteristics must be mapped at a common
level of resolution. Collecting the required data is a time consuming process if summary data in
map or tabular form is not available for the characteristics. For Spokane County, simplifying the
model to five elements greatly reduces the work required to develop the model without losing
the ability to resolve differences in susceptibility. These five characteristics reflect essentially
the same range of variability that the seven DRASTIC characters would reflect when applied to
Spokane County. The result of applying the SHADI model is a set of “susceptibility ratings,”
usually presented in map form, for discrete geographic units in the study area. The following
relationship is used to calculate the final susceptibility value:
Aquifer Susceptibility = (S x Ws) + (H x Wh) + (A x Wa) + (D X I)
Where S, H, A, D, and I are described above and Ws, Wh, and Wa are weighting factors to bring
the relative importance of soil, hydraulic conductivity and annual recharge into balance with the
depth to water--vadose zone term. Both the ranking values and weighting values used in SHADI
are consistent with those used in DRASTIC.
Aquifer susceptibility using methods like SHADI can be applied “manually” by mapping the
various characteristics on tissue paper, overlaying the maps of the characteristics, tracing the
boundaries of areas with a unique set of characteristics and manually totaling the ratings for
each area. However, this process is easily accomplished using Geographic Information System
computer software. The SHADI data sets for Spokane County will be developed in a format that
will allow the automated delineation of “unique area” boundaries and the totaling of the final
susceptibility rating for those areas.
Like DRASTIC, SHADI is intended to establish the relative risk to contamination that exists for
aquifers examined using a consistent database. The model results from one “study” should not
be compared with those from another. Similarly, once a study area has been defined it should
be treated as a whole. Breaking a study area into subsets requires a reassessment of the ratings

Explanation of Ratings shown on SHADI Map Layers.
Soil Media.
SHADI Ratings for Soil type.
For most purposes, soil is considered to be that part of the earth’s surface in which plants grow.
The soil layer extends from the land surfaces to the bottom of the root zone - the depth to which
plant roots extend. The soil zone is characterized by high biological activity. In a semi-arid
climate like that around Spokane a root zone of 5 to 6 feet is common. For most contaminant
discharges within an aquifer recharge area the soil is the first line of defense against
contamination. Many of the biochemical actions that take place in the soil can destroy potentially
harmful wastes, result in their removal by plants or lead to their being bound up as part of the
soil matrix. Most of these processes depend on the amount of clay, silt and organic material in
the soil. High levels of one or more of these components lead to better ground water protection.
Table 1 provides a summary of the SHADI ratings for the soil types common in Spokane County.

Hydraulic Conductivity.
SHADIR Ratings for Hydraulic Conductivity.
Hydraulic conductivity refers to the ease with which water moves through the aquifer media.
This is dependent on the amount of interconnected void space in the aquifer. Loose sand and
gravel or highly fractured rock have the highest hydraulic conductivity. Aquifers with high
hydraulic conductivity more easily disperse contaminants away from the point where they enter
the ground water. Table 2 provides a summary of the SHADI ratings for the hydraulic
conductivity of the common aquifer types found in Spokane County.

Annual Recharge.
SHADI Ratings for Annual Recharge.
The amount of water recharged to an aquifer is an important element in assessing ground water
susceptibility because it is the recharge water that carries contaminants to the ground water. In
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐69
general, the greater the amount of recharge, the greater the potential impact. Because
precipitation, as with all climatic characteristics, varies greatly from year to year, annual
recharge also varies greatly. For long term planning purposes using “average” values for
precipitation to calculate recharge should produce good results for tracking potential ground
water impacts and estimating the amount of water available for use. However, recharge levels
at both extremes can skew the overall impact. Extremely high recharge may dilute the
concentration of contaminants to below the background levels in ground water. Conversely,
extremely low recharge over a period of time may result in the accumulation of contaminants in
the soil. A normal or above normal recharge period could then flush these contaminants into
ground water in a short period of time. The susceptibility rating values associated with various
levels of recharge found in Spokane County are summarized in Table 3.

Depth to Water
SHADI Ratings for Depth to Water
Depth to water is important in establishing the susceptibility of an aquifer because it determines
the thickness of the material through which contaminated water must travel before it reaches
ground water. In general the more material contaminated water moves through the greater the
probability that some or all of the contaminants will be removed. A number of physical (e.g.
filtration of suspended solids), chemical (e.g. precipitation of phosphorus) and biological
(bacterial break down of organic chemicals into CO2 and water) may affect the contaminants in
recharge water. In addition to the amount of material that the water must pass, deeper water
tables usually mean longer travel times, The longer the travel time, the greater the opportunity
for contaminant removal. Table 4 provides a summary of the SHADI ratings for the several depth
to water ranges found in Spokane County.

Importance of the Vadose Zone
SHADI Ratings for Importance of the Vadose Zone
The vadose zone is the unsaturated zone between the bottom of the root zone and the water
table. As a rule, the vadose zone is composed of material similar to that found in the soil or that
which contains the aquifer. Because it is below the root zone there is little biological activity
under ordinary conditions, so while the vadose zone is important for some of the same reasons
it is likely to be less effective than soil. As indicated above, the finer the material the better the
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐70
vadose zone is at removing contaminants. Where the vadose zone is composed of “solid” rock,
the size of cracks and fractures and the complexity of the fracture zone determines the
contaminant removal ability. The main difference between SHADI and DRASTIC lies in how the
nature of the material in the vadose zone is accounted for in the model. Not all material behave
the same ability to retain contaminants or facilitate their decomposition; silty materials will retain
more water and hold it longer than coarse gravel. The larger surface area exposed by finer
materials usually increases the amount of contaminants that can be removed. In SHADI the
Importance of the Vadose Zone is used as a “weighting factor” for Depth to Water. Under this
scheme a thick layer of coarse material may be a poorer buffer to contamination than a thin
layer of finer soil. Where there are “confining layers” between the land surface and the water
table these zones increase the removal of contaminants by providing longer travel times and
providing a zone of fine material that increases contaminant removal. Table 5 provides a
summary of the SHADI ratings for the vadose zone materials common in Spokane County.

Results from the application of SHADI
The product of the analysis of ground water susceptibility using SHADI is a set of six maps.
Maps one through five depict the characteristics of the environment considered by SHADI. Map
six is the susceptibility rating itself. Maps one through five are based on 1) existing mapped
data, 2) interpretation of well drillers’ logs and 3) a combination of the above. Soil and Annual
Recharge are taken from the mapping contained in the Spokane County Soil Survey (Donaldson
and Giese, 1968) and annual precipitation maps prepared by the National Weather Service
(NOAA, 1990). These maps probably represent the range of resolution for the mapping. The
Soil Survey maps show variations in soil type for parcels as small as five acres. Annual
precipitation at any given point in Spokane County varies greatly from year to year. The
precipitation map, and therefore the annual recharge map, cannot show this variation. The
areas of equal annual recharge can move a mile to the east or west from year to year. The
resolution of the annual recharge map is good in the center of the ranges and poor at the edges.
This means that the resolution of this factor ranges from 640 acres to 2560 acres. Hydraulic
Conductivity is derived from tests on individual wells penetrating the various ground water
bearing formations. The distribution of Hydraulic Conductivity in the various ground water units
is based on both the individual well information and the existing geology maps, which delineate
the areas in which aquifers with similar characteristics might be found. Given the level of detail
in the geology maps, the amount of individual well data used and the range of values for
hydraulic conductivity employed in SHADI the resolution of this mapping is estimated to be
about 160 acres.
Depth to Water for most of the urbanizing area of the county is derived from special studies that
show considerable detail. The resolution of this characteristic for these areas is about 40 acres.
For the rest of the county the information for Depth to Water was derived in the same manner
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐71
as Hydraulic Conductivity and thus has a resolution of about 160 acres. Importance of the
Vadose Zone is based on a recently completed geologic map of Spokane County (Johnson,
1997). The resolution of this map is about 40 acres. The Geographic Information System (GIS)
used a GRID process to calculate the susceptibility rating. The grid process divides the 5 source
maps into squares that are the same size and positions throughout the whole county. The values
(rate times weight) of the stacked squares in all 5 layers are added together for the final
susceptibility rating. The GRID process was programmed to use squares 300 feet on a side (2.1
acres).
SHADI rating areas less than 40 acres in size were combined with adjacent areas to create the
final SHADI rating map.
AQUIFER SUSCEPTIBILITY MAP
SHADI Rating Map revised to create Aquifer Susceptibility Map
The SHADI rating map was revised to create the Aquifer Susceptibility Map by adding additional
areas to coordinate wellhead protection throughout Spokane County. The Washington State
Department of Health provided the data for wellhead protection coordination based on site
specific (well specific) determination of susceptibility of contamination to wells. The data
includes designated wellhead protection areas and areas within 1,000-foot radius of Group A
community and Group A community transient wells without reported plans. As wellhead
protection plans are completed for wells, the 1,000 foot radius placeholder will be replaced by
the Washington Department of Health-certified wellhead protection area. These areas are
treated as high aquifer susceptibility areas. It is the intent of the Aquifer Susceptibility Map to
coordinate the wellhead protection program with protection of critical aquifer recharge areas.
Uses and activities within designated wellhead protection areas subject to critical aquifer
recharge area regulations are required to meet the standards for high aquifer susceptibility.
However, applicants have the opportunity to provide evidence to support a low or medium
aquifer susceptibility rating by means of a hydrogeologic report. The City, in consultation with
agencies of expertise, shall review and accept or reject the hydrogeologic report. The Aquifer
Susceptibility Map will be revised as required to display updated date on wellhead protection
areas received from the Washington State Department of Health.

Article 10-6C — Wellhead Protection
Reserved for Wellhead Protection documents adopted by the City.
At the time of adoption of this Development Code, wellhead protection responsibility has been held by
the Liberty Lake Sewer & Water District; however the City has expressed concerns about the protection
of our public water system. The Liberty Lake Sewer & Water District adopted the Spokane Aquifer Joint
Board Wellhead Protection Program in 1997 with an individual water purveyor contingency / emergency
plan for the Liberty Lake area contained in Appendix Q-8 of the document. Chapter 7 of the document
states that individual purveyor contingency plans should be updated and approved by water purveyor's
elected officials every five years. The contingency plan is currently outdated and the City may take the
necessary steps in the future to update this plan or modify it to address the community's future needs,
in order to reflect the current Liberty Lake community.

Article 10-6E — Environmental Conservation
Sections:
10-6E-1 Transfer of Development Rights
10-6E-2 Conservation Futures Program
10-6E-1 Transfer of Development Rights
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement the comprehensive plan and encourage
the protection of open spaces through Transfer of Development Rights. Transfer of
Development Rights (TDR) allows individuals to purchase and sell residential development
rights from lands that provide a public benefit. Such lands include forest, open space, regional
trails, and habitat for threatened or endangered species. Landowners receive financial
compensation without developing or selling their land and the public receives permanent
preservation of the land. Transferred development rights can be used to build additional houses
on other parcels in more appropriate areas within the City. The program reduces the
development potential in the "sending area" and transfers that development opportunity to a
"receiving area". The sending area property owner is paid to keep the land undeveloped, while
the receiving area property buys the credit, allowing additional development beyond what
zoning allows in the receiving area. The Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Program should
be implemented on a regional basis with participation from Spokane County.
B. Determination of Number of Development Rights. The zoning of a parcel and its size are used
to calculate the number of development rights that are attached to a parcel. The acreage that
can be used to determine the number of development rights is the area of the parcel minus the
amount in submerged lands and any land being retained for development on site, based on the
zoning requirements. The number of development rights that a particular parcel qualifies for will
depend on the specifics of the situation and would be determined on a case by case basis
during the qualification process.
C. Transfer Authorized. Allowed development rights may be transferred from one portion of a
property to another portion of the same property, or from one property to another property. A
transfer of development rights shall not be approved unless it meets one or more of the criteria
in 1-4 below, and it conforms to subsections D-E:
1. Protection of critical areas either by dedication to the public or a land trust, or by a nonrevocable
conservation easement; or
2. Dedication of land to the public for park or recreational purposes; or
3. The density transfer is used to develop a mix of single family and multi-family housing
on the same property or development site.
D. Prohibited Transfers. Development rights shall not be transferred from: land proposed for street
right-of-way, stormwater detention facilities, private streets, and similar areas which do not
provide open space or recreational values to the public.
E. Transfer Rules. All density transfers shall conform to all of the following rules:
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐76
1. Allowed housing units shall be transferred only to buildable lands (“receiving areas”).
The number of allowed housing units shall be reduced on properties from which density
is transferred (“sending areas”) based on the number of housing units transferred. The
new number of housing units allowed on the sending area shall be recorded on a deed
for the property that runs with the land. The deed shall state that the number of allowed
housing units is subject to review and approval by the City, in accordance with current
zoning and development codes;
2. The number of units which can be transferred is limited to the number of units which
would have been allowed on 50 percent of the unbuildable area if not for these
regulations; and
3. The total number of housing units per property or development site shall not exceed 100
percent of the maximum number of units per net acre permitted under the applicable
comprehensive plan designation.
4. All density transfer development proposals shall comply with the development standards
of the applicable zoning district.
10-6E-2 Conservation Futures Program
A. Purpose and Applicability. "Conservation Futures" is a property tax on all lands within Spokane
County, enabled by the Washington State Legislature in 1971. Spokane County adopted and
began a local program in 1994. Spokane County’s Conservation Futures Program is intended
to protect, preserve, maintain, enhance, restore, limit the future use of or otherwise conserve
selected open space land, farmland, forests, wetlands, wildlife habitats, and other lands having
significant recreational, social, scenic, or aesthetic values within the boundaries of Spokane
County. Acquired properties will not be developed but kept in an enhanced natural area
consistent with the Revised Code of Washington (RCW Chapter 84.34). As a jurisdiction within
Spokane County, the City of Liberty Lake will participate in this program when possible.
Conservation Futures funds are used towards acquisition of property and/or property easements
that ensure public access and enjoyment of our greatest resources in perpetuity.
B. Program Implementation. The Conservation Futures program shall be implemented through the
process adopted by the Spokane County Parks Department. The process includes:
1. Submittal of Nomination - Review by Parks Staff and Recommendation of Nominated
Sites for consideration by the Lands Subcommittee
3. Holding of Public Meetings to Review Final Nomination List
4. Conducting Property Tours, Inspections, and Preparing Evaluation Scoring
5. Preparation of the Priority Acquisition List and review by the Spokane County Parks
Advisory Committee (PAC)
6. Final review and approval by Board of County Commissioners
C. Evaluation Criteria. As outlined in the Spokane County Parks Conservation Futures
implementation program, the nomination submittal forms request certain types of information to
assist the Lands Subcommittee in determining many key factors in assigning a point value to
the property. To assist the Subcommittee in selecting the property(s) that ensure public access
and enjoyment of the greatest resources they will visit each site to evaluate the nominated
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐77
property using a set list of standard quantitative criteria with a point system. The criteria assigns
points in considering the identified need for open space within the area, whether the nominated
property owner(s) is willing to donate to an endowment fund for the long term maintenance of
the property and does it contain any major environmental concerns. Evaluation criteria
considers the size of the property, its’ riparian/wetland habitat and/or corridor values or critical
links to such along with the ability for the public to access water systems. Other questions
address whether the property serves as a buffer to development, the potential threat of loss to
development and the degree of demonstrated public support for the acquisition. The nominated
property will be evaluated for its ease of access to the public and whether it will likely become
a destination for various types of public uses.

Sections:
10-6F-1 General Provisions
10-6F-2 Administration
10-6F-3 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
10-6F-1 General Provisions
A. Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.
These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of City
of Liberty Lake.
B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a
scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Spokane County “
dated July 6, 2010, and any revisions thereto, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of these regulations. The Flood Insurance Study and the FIRM are on file at 22710 E Country
Vista Drive, Liberty Lake, Washington 99019. The best available information for flood hazard
area identification as outlined in §10-6F-2(C)(2) of this Article shall be the basis for regulation
until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under §10-6F-2(C)(2) of this Article.

result of proposed development.
B. Designation of the Local Administrator
The Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement
the provisions of this Article by granting or denying development permit applications in
accordance with its provisions.
C. Duties & Responsibilities of the Local Administrator
Duties of the (Local Administrator) shall include, but not be limited to:
1. Permit Review
a. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of
these regulations have been satisfied.
b. Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have
been obtained from those Federal, State, or local governmental agencies from
which prior approval is required.
c. Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is
located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment
provisions of §10-6F-3(D)(1) are met.
d. Review all development permits to determine that the site is reasonably safe
from flooding.
2. Use of Other Base Flood Data (In A and V Zones)
When base flood elevation data has not been provided (in A or V Zones) in accordance
with §10-6F-1(B), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, the (Local
Administrator) shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer
§10-6F-3(B), Specific Standards, and §10-6F-3(D), Floodways.
3. Information to be Obtained and Maintained
a. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study,
FIRM, or required as in paragraph (C)(2) of this section, obtain and record the
actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not the structure contains a basement, with said information recorded
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐80
on a current elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31) with Section B completed
by the local official.
b. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures
where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as
required in paragraph (C)(2) of this section:
i. Obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which
the structure was floodproofed; and,
ii. Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in paragraph (A)(2)(c)
of this section.
c. Certification required by Section §10-6F-3 (D) (floodway encroachments).
d. Records of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
e. Improvement and damage calculations.
f. Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of these
regulations.
4. Alteration of Watercourses.
a. Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification
to the Federal Insurance Administration.
b. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
5. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries.
Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas
of special flood hazards (e.g. where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such
appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of the Rules and
Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program.
D. Conditions for Variances from Flood Elevation Standards.
1. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may
be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a small
or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
3. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant;
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐81
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
5. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the
general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are
not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or
financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated
residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from flood elevations should be quite
rare.
6. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to
allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can
be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other
variance criteria except subparagraph 2, above, and otherwise complies with
paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of §10-6F-3(A) of the General Standards.
7. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below the base flood elevation and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk.
10-6F-3 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
A. General Standa rds
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required:
1. Anchoring
a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
b. All manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. For more detailed
information, refer to guidebook, FEMA-85, “Manufactured Home Installation in
Flood Hazard Areas.”
2. Construction Materials and Methods
a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with
materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
b. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
c. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and
other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so
as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. Locating such equipment below the base flood elevation
may cause annual flood insurance premiums to be increased.
3. Utilities
a. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐82
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
b. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway;
c. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters;
d. Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding.
4. Subdivision Proposals
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage;
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood damage;
d. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from
another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and
other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or 5 acres
(whichever is less).
5. Review of Building Permits
Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM,
or from another authoritative source (§10-6F-2(C)(2)), applications for building permits
shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from
flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical
data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to
elevate at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in
higher insurance rates.
B. Specific nSdatards
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set
forth in §10-6F-1(B), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, or §10-6F-
2(C)(2), Use of Other Base Flood Data.
1. Residential Construction
a. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the
base flood elevation (BFE).
b. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are
prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
i. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐83
ii. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
iii. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
c. Subgrade crawl spaces are prohibited unless the following conditions are met:
i. The interior grade of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation must
not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade.
ii. The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall,
must not exceed four feet at any point.
iii. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height
according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements
for flood hazard areas (refer to FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01, page 7,
Guidance for Pre-Engineered Crawlspaces). This limitation is intended to
prevent these crawlspaces from being converted into habitable spaces.
iv. There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be
drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage
system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage
characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural
drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such
as perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage
by gravity or mechanical means.
v. The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per
second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five feet per
second, other foundation types should be used.
vi. Below-grade crawlspace construction in accordance with the
requirements listed above will not be considered basements.
2. Nonresidential Construciot n
a. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or
other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation; or, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
b. Be floodproofed so that below one foot or more above the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
c. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy;
d. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or
review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall
be provided to the official as set forth in §10-6F-2(C)(3)(b);
e. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the
same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in §10-6FApril
13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐84
3(B)(1)(b).
3. Manufactured Homes
All manufactured homes in the floodplain to be placed or substantially improved on sites
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
4. Recreational Vehicles
Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:
a. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, (or)
b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system,
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices,
and have no permanently attached additions; or
c. Meet the requirements of §10-6F-3(B)(3) above and the elevation and anchoring
requirements for manufactured homes.
C. AE and A1-30 Zones with Base Flood Elevations but No Floodways
In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more
than one foot at any point within the community.
D. Floodways
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §10-6F-1(B) are areas designated
as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters that can carry debris, and increase erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated
floodways, except for:
a. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase
the ground floor area; and,
b. Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does
not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
i. Before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or
ii. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
c. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state
or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified
April 13, 2020 City of Liberty Lake Development Code Title 10 – Chapter 6 Page 6‐85
by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may
be excluded in the 50 percent.
3. If §10-6F-3(D)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §10-6F-3, Provisions for
Flood Hazard Reduction.
