CHAPTER 3-1200. HISTORIC
PRESERVATION.
Part 3-1210. General. (Authority: U.C.A. § 10-8-
85.9)
(1) Purpose. Tremonton City recognizes that the
historical heritage of the community is among its most
valued and important assets. It is, therefore, the intent
of Tremonton to identify, preserve, protect and
enhance historic buildings, structures, sites, objects,
and districts lying within the city limits of Tremonton
City.
Part 3-1220. Historic Preservation Commission. A
Historic Preservation Commission is hereby established
by Tremonton City with the following provisions:
(1) The commission shall consist of a minimum of
five (5) members.
(2) All commission members must have a
demonstrated interest, knowledge, or experience in the
fields related to historic preservation.
(3) To the extent available in the community, at
least two (2) members of the commission shall be
professionals in fields related to historic preservation
(i.e., history, architectural history, archaeology, historic
architecture, or planning).
(4) Commission meetings shall be held at least
twice a year.
(5) Written minutes of each commission meeting
shall be prepared and made available for public
inspection.
Part 3-1230. Commission Duties. The Historic
Preservation Commission shall have the following
duties:
(1) Advise the City Council and other interested
parties in the community on matters related to historic
preservation and history.
(2) Coordinate with other City entities and
community organizations to promote collaborated
efforts related to the community’s history and cultural
affairs.
(3) Conduct surveys of local historic properties in
compliance with standards set by the State Historic
Preservation Office.
(4) Maintain an inventory of surveyed historic
properties, including site forms and related support
materials, in a publicly accessible location.
(5) Participate in planning and land-use processes
undertaken by the City that have the potential to affect
historic properties.
(6) Promote and conduct educational and

(7) Review and comment to the State Historic

Part 3-1240. Standards for Rehabilitation and
Design Guidelines. The Historic Preservation
Commission shall use the following standards and
guidelines in advising the City Council and other
parties on the appropriate treatment of historic
properties:
(1) Standards for Rehabilitation. These standards
apply to historic buildings of all periods, styles, types,
materials, and sizes. They apply to both the exterior and
CITY GOVERNMENT 3-17
the interior of historic buildings. The standards also
encompass related landscape features and the
building’s site and environment as well as attached,
adjacent, or related new construction.
(a) A property shall be used for its historic
purpose or be placed in a new use that
requires minimal change to the defining
characteristics of the building and its site and
environment.
(b) The historic character of a property shall
be retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided.
(c) Each property shall be recognized as a
physical record of its time, place, and use.
Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural
features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
(d) Most properties change over time; those
changes that have acquired historic
significance in their own right shall be
retained and preserved.
(e) Distinctive features, finishes, and
construction techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property
shall be preserved.
(f) Deteriorated historic features shall be
repaired rather than replaced. Where the
severity of deterioration requires replacement
of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall
match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities and, where possible,
materials. Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence.
(g) Chemical or physical treatments, such as
sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface
cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
(h) Significant archeological resources
affected by a project shall be protected and
preserved. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be
undertaken.
(i) New additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction shall not destroy
historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
(j) New additions and adjacent or related
new construction shall be undertaken in such
a manner that if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be
unimpaired.
(2) General Design Guidelines. These guidelines
expand on some of the concepts articulated in the
Standards in Part 13-1240 (1).
(a) Historic Sites, Historic Buildings, and
Contributing Buildings in Historic Districts.
(i) Avoid demolition of historic and
contributing buildings. They are a finite
resource and cannot be replaced.
(ii) Vacant buildings should be weatherand
vandal-proofed to minimize further
deterioration and the threat to public
safety.
(iii) Rehabilitation work, especially on
the exterior and the principal facade,
should preserve existing historic features
or replace them, if absolutely necessary,
with features and materials known to have
existed on the building. Avoid “dressing
up” buildings by adding features based on
speculation.
(iv) Avoid moving buildings whenever
possible, especially to create artificial
groupings of historic buildings. If
buildings must be moved, the new site
should be similar to the original site, and
the original setback and orientation of the
building on the lot should be replicated.
(b) Additions to Historic Buildings and New
Construction Within a Historic District.
(i) New additions to historic buildings
should be subordinate to the original
building, that is, lower in height, attached
to the rear or set back along the side, and
subordinate in scale and architectural
detailing.
(ii) Height, width, setback, roof shape,
and the overall scale and massing of new
buildings within a historic district should
be compatible with surrounding historic
buildings and the overall streetscape.
(iii) Materials on at least the primary
facade(s) should be similar to original
materials on facades of surrounding
historic buildings (usually brick, stucco,
stone, or wood siding, depending on the
specific characteristics of the district).
(iv) Architectural details (including wood
or metal trim, porches, cornices, arches,
window and door features, etc.) should be
compatible with but not replicate historic
features on surrounding historic
buildings.
3-18 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
(v) Window and door openings should
be similar in size and orientation
(vertical or horizontal) to openings on
historic buildings and should take up
about the same percentage of the overall
facade as those on surrounding historic
buildings.
(vi) Proportion of Principal Facades.
The relationship of the width to the
height of the principal elevations shall be
in scale with surrounding structures and
streetscape. Wider new buildings can be
divided into segments that more closely
resemble the facade widths of historic
buildings.
(vii) Roof Shape. The roof shape of a
building shall be visually compatible
with the surrounding structures and
streetscape. Unusual roof shapes,
pitches, and colors are discouraged.
CHAPTER 3-1300. APPEALS BOARD.
3-1301. Creation of Board and Purpose. In
accordance with U.C.A. § 10-3-1106 (7) (a) there is

3-1302. Purpose Explained. The Post-Deprivation
Hearing or Appeal Hearing is part of the "due process"
requirement provided to eligible government
employees. The Post-Deprivation Hearing stems from
a court case in which the United States Supreme Court
held that non-probationary civil servants had a
property right to their employment and such
employment could not be deprived unless employees
were given an opportunity to hear and respond to the
charges against them prior to being deprived.
3-1303. Method and Manner of Choosing Board
Members. The Board shall consist of five (5) regular
members to hear an employee’s appeal and four (4)
alternate members. The regular Board member and
alternates shall be as follows:
(1) City Council. Two (2) regular members of
the Board and one (1) alternate shall be from the
Tremonton City Council. Whenever the Board is
assembled to conduct business the longest tenured
City Council members are appointed to be regular
Board members. If there is a tie regarding the longest
tenured City Council members than the two City
Council members’ who last name comes first
alphabetically will be regular Board members. With
the next longest tenured City Council member being an
alternate member.
(2) Department Head. One (1) regular member
of the Board shall be the Public Works Director. If the
Public Works Director is involved in the disciplinary
action in which the employee is appealing than the
Police Chief shall be the alternate member to sit to hear
the employee’s appeal in the place of the Public Works
Director.
(3) Employees. Two (2) regular members of the
Board and two (2) alternates shall be comprised of
employees eligible as per U.C.A. § 10-3-1105. The
regular employee Board members and alternates shall
be elected by popular vote administered by the City
Recorder or their deputies. Each Tremonton City
employee who is eligible to request a Post-Deprivation
Hearing (appeal hearing) shall vote for four (4)
Tremonton City’s employees. The top two (2) votegetters
shall be regular Board members with the 3rd and
4th vote-getters serving as alternates.
3-1304. Chairperson. The Chairperson of the Board
shall be the one (1) of the two (2) sitting City Council
members and shall be determined by a flip of a coin
administered by the City Recorder. The Chairperson
shall be a voting member.
3-1305. Secretary. The Board’s secretary shall be
the City Recorder or their deputies. The Board
Secretary shall prepare the agenda, post the agenda and
prepare the minutes of the proceedings of the Board and
otherwise ensure compliance with the Open and Public
Meeting Act.
3-1306. Board Members Term. The terms of
regular Board members and alternate Board members
for the City Council shall be concurrent with their
elected office. The terms for the Public Works
Director, Police Chief, and other employees shall be
concurrent with their employment with Tremonton
City. Vacancies on the Board shall be filled in the
same manner as described in Section 3-1303. Method
and Manner of Choosing Board Members.
3-1307. Quorum & Voting. Three members of the
Board shall be present to be a quorum, and it shall take
the majority of the quorum present to conduct any
Board business. As per U.C.A. § 10-3-1106 (5) (a)
(i) the decisions of the Board shall be by secret ballot,
and shall be certified by the City Recorder within
fifteen (15) days from the date the matter referred to
except as provided in U.C.A. § 10-3-1106 (5) (a) (ii) as
amended.
3-1308. Open Meetings Act. The Board is a public
body and as such its associated meeting shall be
CITY GOVERNMENT 3-19
established and conducted in accordance with U.C.A.
§ Title 52, Chapter (Open and Public Meeting Act).
As per U.C.A. § 10-3-1106(4)(b) the employee may
have a public hearing. The Board may vote to close
the meeting as allowed by U.C.A. § 52-4-204 and
U.C.A. § 52-4-205 as amended.
3-1309. Assembling a Quorum. It is the intent of
this ordinance to have sufficient regular Board
members and alternate Board members to
expeditiously assemble a quorum of the Board as the
need arises as envisioned by U.C.A. § 10-3-1106(5)(a)
without delaying the “due process” rights of an
employee. The City Recorder or their deputies have
the authority to assemble a quorum upon receipt of a
filed written notice of the appeal from an eligible
employee. The City Recorder shall try to contact
every regular Board member as to the date, time, and
place of the meeting and if a message is left wait a
reasonable period for the regular Board member to
respond as their availability to participate in the appeal
hearing. After attempting to contact regular Board
members and waiting a reasonable period the City
Recorder shall have the sole authority to make the
determination as to which regular Board members are
available to participate in the appeal hearing and
which alternate Board members shall sit in the place
of a regular Board member.
3-1310. Procedure for Conducting an Appeal.
Eligible employees as per U.C.A. § 10-3-1105 who are
being subject to: termination; suspension of over two
(2) days without pay; or involuntary transfer to a
position with less remuneration may appeal their
deprivation of property rights to the Board.
Appellant-employees shall file written notice of the
appeal with the City Recorder in accordance with
U.C.A. § 10-3-1106(3)(a) and declare therein if they
desire a public hearing as allowed in 10-3-1106 (4) (b).
Appellant-employees, the City Recorder, and Board
shall conduct any properly filed appeal in accordance
with U.C.A. § 10-3-1106(3) through U.C.A. § 10-3-
1106(6) as amended.
3-1311. Standard of Review. The Board’s standard
of review for deciding appeals shall be “Clearly
Erroneous”. The Board shall investigate, take and
receive evidence, and fully hear and determine those
matters which are appealed to the Board to determine
if after reviewing the Findings of Facts surrounding
the disciplinary action if Plain Error was made in
administering the discipline. Harmless Error shall
not be grounds for reversing disciplinary action.
3-1312. Overturn Employee Disciplinary Action.
If the Board votes to overturns the termination;
suspension of over two (2) days without pay; or
involuntary transfer to a position with less remuneration
than: (1) the City shall reinstate any loss of pay
associated with the Employee Disciplinary Action; (2)
the Mayor or City Manager shall remove the record of
the disciplinary action from the employee’s personnel
file.
3-1313. Court of Appeals. If the Appeal Board
upholds the termination; suspension of over two (2)
days without pay; or involuntary transfer to a position
with less remuneration, an appellant-employee has no
additional appeal rights with the City, but the final
action of the Board may be reviewed by the Court of
Appeals as per U.C.A. § 10-3-1106 (6) as amended.

Constitution of the State of Utah, nor shall
the name of the municipality be substituted

result of that substitution would require

incident to the administration or operation
of the Ordinance.
(c) If an annual license has been issued to a

CHAPTER 7-200. TREMONTON CITY
DOWNTOWN REDEVELOPMENT PLAN.
Part 7-210. Tremonton Central Business
District to Be Improved.
The Tremonton City Council has declared that it is in
the best interest and general welfare of the
community to assist in the public and private
improvements of the Central Business District (CBD)
in order to influence the creation of a better
economic, social, and physical environment to
accommodate the expected growth in the service
area. The Utah Neighborhood Development Act
(UCA 1953, 11-19-1) authorizes local government
officials to establish a Redevelopment Agency to
undertake the process of redevelopment. The
Agency is the vehicle for the replanning, redesigning,
and rehabilitating of areas, structures or uses which
show evidence of deterioration and dilapidation, or
otherwise pose a threat to the public health and safety
of the community.
On December 6, 1980, the Tremonton City Council
designated themselves by Ordinance 81.1 as the
Redevelopment Agency of the City of Tremonton,
complete with all powers and subject to all
restrictions provided in the Neighborhood
Development Act. The Tremonton City Council has
designated by Resolution the general area between
100 North and 100 South from the railroad tracks on
the west to the Malad River on the east as the survey
area. With the assistance of a redevelopment
consultant, a survey of the physical, social and
economic conditions was conducted to determine the
need and feasibility for undertaking a redevelopment
program. The purpose of the survey was to assess the
overall conditions within the area which indicate
characteristics detrimental to good planning,
development, and economic use.
7-211. Project Boundary Description.
Beginning at a point 79 feet South of the Southwest
corner of Block 13, Plat A, Tremonton City Survey,
said point being on the South side of 100 South
Street, and on the East edge of the Malad Valley
Railroad, running
Thence East 591 feet to the East edge of 100
West Street;
Thence North 244 feet;
Thence East 317 feet to the West edge of
Tremont Street;
Thence South 244 feet to the South edge of 100
South Street;
Thence East to the West bank of the Malad
River;
Thence Northeasterly along the West bank of the
Malad River to the center of Main Street;
Thence Northwesterly along said West bank to a
point 900 feet North and 75 feet East of the Southeast
corner of Section 3;
Thence West 325 feet;
Thence South 450 feet;
Thence West 150 feet to 200 East Street;
Thence West along the North edge of 100 North
Street 1,700 feet to the East edge of the Malad Valley
Railroad;
Thence Southwesterly along said railroad to the
point of beginning.
7-212. Description of Existing Conditions in
Survey-project Area.
(1) Land Use. Land uses in the project area are
tabulated in the land use tabulation. Streets and
alleys were not included in the tabulation but are
included in the project area. Of the 31-1/3 (31.35)
acres of private land in the project some 5-1/2 acres
(17.5%) are vacant, and 6-2/3 acres (21.3%) are used
for housing. It is felt that 1-1/2 acres of housing and
automobile garage area should be cleared due to
blight and included with the vacant land for
development potential. Commercial sales and
offices, etc. account for 29.1% while housing
occupies 21.3%. Transportation related activities
including car sales, parts, and repair comprise 21.9%,
medical-dental total 2.3%, and miscellaneous uses
amount to 7.9%.
Refer to "Strengthening Retail Trade in the
Tremonton Area," February 1992 and "Marketing
and Development Manual," April 1991, for current
information on land use, parking, and floor space use
in the Central Business District.
(2) Physical Factors. Physical deficiencies
observed in the project area include vacancies,
quitting business signs and conversion of retail sales
to office use. In addition, some old structures show
deterioration and off-street parking is often unmarked
and unpaved. On the other hand, evidence of
optimism over future growth has encouraged new
construction and rehabilitation of some structures.
An evaluation of such physical condition as curbs,
gutters, sidewalks and street paving shows some
areas missing and others deteriorating. Access to offstreet
parking is generally poor. The Utah
Department of Transportation has recently rebuilt
Main Street which will remain a Business 84 Route.
The compactness of the Central Business District on
Main Street remains attractive even though
7-2 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
businesses continue to locate farther and farther out
from the Central Business District on Main Street.
Since Main Street is the only through street east and
west there is a bottleneck on each end of the Central
Business District. However, the one to the west by
the railroad tracks will be easier to correct than the
one to the west by the Malad River.
The state is planning I-15 and has constructed I-84
around the City. Tremonton City is in favor of the
plan but not the interchange location proposed on I-
84 for access to Tremonton, which is located on 10th
North instead of Main Street. The bypass of
Tremonton, now a fact, is acceptable and should not
adversely impact the City. However, the interchange
location will make a great difference, possibly
adversely affecting I-15 access, and ability to attract
potential customers to the Main Street area.
The survey of the project area also revealed other
negative factors affecting the overall physical quality
of the project area, such as the following:
(a) Evidence of obsolescence and neglect
of buildings and structures.
(b) Negative visual image of unmaintained
and unimproved back lots and rights-of-way.
(c) Unsightly overhead utility lines and
poles.
(d) Lack of cohesive recognizable identity
due to predominance of parking pavement
and sidewalks without adequate
landscaping.
(e) General clutter and negative appearance
resulting from unscreened outside storage
areas.
(f) Poor aesthetic quality of some
advertising signs.
(3) Social Factors. At the present time
approximately 150 persons reside in the project area,
living in 15 single family detached units and 47
multi-family structures (two (2) units or more). A
few of the homes are among the oldest in the City
and are in need of some rehabilitation to bring them
up to standard. Homes are found adjacent to
commercial uses and between them, and will
eventually have to give way to commercial
development. At the same time, the higher density
structures should be maintained and additional
convenient housing supplied either in or near the
Central Business District.
(4) Economic Factors. The project area serves
as the major retail center of the northern Bear River
Valley. Thus it is important to assure its continued
economic vitality. Economic adjustment is seen
among the businesses in the project area such as a
few vacant buildings and some underutilized second
floor space. The general assessed valuation of
property in the project area, inclusive of both land
and building, is nearly four (4) million dollars. This
figure does not include any personal property
assessment of the premises. The current assessed
valuation for each block and the entire project area is
shown on the assessment tabulation.
7-213. Intent of the Redevelopment Plan. It is
the intent of this Redevelopment Plan to provide a
framework and vehicle for cooperation and
consideration of downtown improvements wherein
all property owners within a project area will have a
right to participate in the redevelopment project.
This Plan is not intended to impose any new agency
controls, regulations, costs, or tax burdens on any
property in a project area.
7-214 Statement of Redevelopment Objectives.
As the Agency undertakes a redevelopment project in
cooperation with private enterprise, the following
general goals and objectives serve as agency guides
for redevelopment:
(1) Remove dilapidated buildings, either
through property acquisition or in cooperation with
the property owner, to permit better land use and
facilitate redevelopment.
(2) Rehabilitate buildings to extend useful life
period and assure the sound long-term economic base
of the Central Business District.
(3) Achieve an attractive environment including
a sensitive concern for architectural and urban design
principles.
(4) Strengthen the tax base and the economic
well being of the City.
(5) Provide complete improvement of public
streets, including curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, street
lights, and landscaped areas, as well as alleys and any
other public right-of-way.
(6) Provide for adequate off-street parking.
(7) Provide for improved pedestrian circulation
systems.
(8) Provide for multi-family housing in and near
the redevelopment area.
The redevelopment goals may be accomplished by
rehabilitating or replacing structurally substandard
buildings, eliminating blighting influences, providing
land for needed public facilities, providing off-street
parking, removing impediments to land assembly and
development, achieving changes in land use, and
improving streets, sidewalks, and curbs and gutters as
necessary. The goals of the Plan are to be
accomplished basically through Agency encouraging
of and assisting private enterprise to carry out
development activities, except where direct action by
the Redevelopment Agency is required to meet
community objectives.
7-215. Redevelopment Plan Concept.
(1) General Land Use Plan
MUNICIPAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROJECTS 7-3
(a) Land Use Map. The "Land Use Map,"
in the City Master Plan incorporated herein
and made a part of this Plan, indicates that
the area is to continue as a "Central Business
District" and is zoned accordingly in the
Tremonton City Land Development Code.
(b) Description of Land Uses in the Project
Area. The following uses, together with
customary accessory uses, are encouraged to
continue in the project area:
Private Uses - The land and buildings in the
project area may be used for any use
specified for a Central Development District
as contained in the City of Tremonton Land
Development Code.
Public Use Right-of-Way - Streets and
alleys in the project area may be altered,
abandoned, or closed as necessary for proper
development of the project area. Additional
public streets, alleys, and easements may be
created in the project area as needed for
proper development. The public rights-ofway
may be used for vehicular and/or
pedestrian traffic and activities typically
found in public rights-of-way.
Public, Semi-Public, Institutional, and Non-
Profit Uses - Parking, open space, public,
and quasi-public uses may be interspersed
with other uses in the area.
(2) Redevelopment Project Standards
(a) General. A redevelopment project is
defined as a project to which the
Redevelopment Agency is a partner by
virtue of its provision of special
improvements, grants, loans, bonds, etc., to
a project. Individual property
improvements, undertaken independently by
property owners without assistance from the
Agency, are not to be construed as a
redevelopment project.
(b) New Construction. Any new
construction undertaken in partnership with
the Redevelopment Agency shall comply
with all applicable Codes and Ordinances
including the City Building, Electrical and
Housing Codes, and City Land Development
Code.
(c) Rehabilitation. If the Agency ever
assists in rehabilitation, such rehabilitation
shall be in such manner that it will be safe
and sound in all physical aspects and be
attractive in appearance and not detrimental
to the surrounding area. All rehabilitation
shall meet existing applicable Codes and
mitigate potential seismic damage.
(d) Limitation of Buildings. The number,
type, size, and height of buildings
constructed in the project area with
assistance from the Redevelopment Agency
shall be determined with the Agency as
outlined by applicable statutes, ordinances,
and codes.
(e) Signs. All signs shall conform to City
sign ordinances as they now exist or are
hereafter amended.
(f) Utilities. The Agency shall require that
all utilities be placed underground when
physically and economically feasible.
g) Incompatible Uses. No future structure
which by reason of appearance, traffic,
smoke, glare, noise, odor, or similar factors
which would be incompatible with the
surrounding areas or structures should be
encouraged in any part of the project area.
Within the project area there should be no
extraction of oil, gas, or other mineral
substances, nor any opening or penetration
for any purpose connected therewith.
(h) Variances and Special Use Permits.
Variances and/or special use permits sought
by a redevelopment project shall be obtained
in the same manner as non-redevelopment
projects -- that is, as regulated in the City
Land Development Code. The Agency shall
not deny any variance or permit granted
legally pursuant to said Code.
(i) Building Permits. Building permits for
redevelopment projects shall be obtained in
the same manner as other construction
projects in the City.
(3) Actions by the City. The City shall aid and
cooperate with the Agency in carrying out this Plan
and shall consider actions necessary to ensure the
continued fulfillment of the purposes of this Plan and
to prevent the spread of conditions causing blight in
the area.
(4) Administration and Implementation of the
Plan. The administration and implementation of this
Plan, including the preparation and execution of any
terms under this Plan shall be performed by the
Agency and/or the City through the Mayor or his
designee(s) acting as Chief Executive Officer of the
Agency.
(5) Duration of the Plan. The provisions of this
Plan shall be effective and the provisions of other
documents formulated pursuant to this plan by the
City Council until such further action of said Council
is taken to terminate this Plan.
(6) Procedure for Amendment. This Plan may
be amended by means of the procedure established in
Section 11-19-23 of the Utah Neighborhood
Development Act, or by any other procedure
established by law.
7-4 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
(7) Proposed Redevelopment Actions. The
Agency proposes to cooperate with property owners
and developers to prevent and eliminate the spread of
blight and obsolescence in the project area through:
(a) Negotiated Acquisition of Property.
Except as specifically exempted herein, the
Agency may acquire but is not required to
acquire, real or personal property located in
the project area, by gift, device, exchange,
purchase or any other lawful method.
Certain public bodies are authorized by state
law to aid and cooperate, with or without
consideration in the planning, undertaking,
construction, or operation of a
redevelopment project. The Agency shall
seek the aid and cooperation of such public
bodies and shall attempt to coordinate this
Plan with the activities of such public bodies
in order to accomplish the purposes of
redevelopment and the highest public good.
The Agency, by law, is not authorized to
acquire real property owned by public
bodies without the consent of such public
bodies. The Agency, however, will seek the
cooperation of all public bodies which own
or intend to acquire property in the project
area.
(b) Property Management. During such
time as property, if any, in the project area is
owned by the Agency, such property shall
be under the management and control of the
Chief Executive Officer of the Agency.
Such property may be rented or leased by
the Agency pending its disposition for
redevelopment.
(c) Relocation. The Agency shall assist all
persons (including families, business
concerns, and others) who may be displaced
by a project in finding other locations and
facilities. In order to carry out a project with
a minimum of hardship to persons who may
be displaced from their dwellings, the
Agency shall assist individuals and families
in finding housing that is decent, safe,
sanitary, within their financial means, in
reasonably convenient locations, and
otherwise suitable to their needs. As
applicable, relocation assistance shall
conform to all provisions and requirements
of the Utah Relocation Assistance Act and
the Uniform Real Properties Acquisition and
Relocation Assistance Act of 1970.
(d) Public Improvements, Facilities and
Utilities. The Agency is authorized to install
and construct or to cause to be installed and
constructed the public improvements, public
facilities, and public utilities (within or
outside the project area) necessary to carry
out the Plan. Such improvements, facilities,
and utilities may include, but are not limited
to, over or underpasses, streets, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, street lights, sewers,
storm drains, traffic signals, electrical
systems, telephone systems, natural gas
systems, water systems, parks, plazas,
playgrounds, motor vehicle and bicycle
parking facilities, and landscaped areas.
(e) Preparation of Building Sites. With
permission of the property owner, the
Agency is authorized to prepare as building
sites any real property in the project area.
(f) Rehabilitation. With permission of the
property owner, the Agency is authorized to
rehabilitate or cause to be rehabilitated any
building or structure in the project area.
(g) Moving of Structures. With permission
of the property owner, the Agency is
authorized to move or cause to be moved
any standard structure or building to a
location within or without the project area.
(h) General Property Disposition and
Development. The Agency is authorized to
dispose and/or develop property owned by
the Agency in accordance with state and
local statutes and in accordance with this
Plan.
(8) Financing Redevelopment of the Project
Area. The Agency is authorized to finance
redevelopment in the project area with financial
assistance from the City and State of Utah, the United
States of America, agency bonds, property tax
increments, interest income, or any other available
source, or by any other lawful means.
The principal public means of financing
redevelopment in the project area is anticipated to be
through tax increment financing, SBA loans,
industrial revenue bonds, U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development Community
Development Block Grants and/or Urban
Development Action Grants.
(a) Tax Increment Provisions. All taxes
levied upon taxable property within the
project area each year by or for the State of
Utah, County of Box Elder, City of
Tremonton, any district, or other public
corporation (hereinafter sometimes called
"taxing agencies") after the effective date of
the Ordinance approving this
Redevelopment Plan, shall be divided as
follows:
(i) That portion of the taxes which
would be produced by the rate upon
which the tax is levied each year by or
for each of said taxing agencies upon
the total sum of the assessed value of
the taxable property in the
MUNICIPAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROJECTS 7-5
redevelopment project area as shown
upon the assessment roll used in
connection with the taxation of such
property of such taxing agency, last
equalized prior to the effective date of
such ordinance, shall be allocated to and
when collected shall be paid into the
funds of the respective taxing agencies
as taxes by or for said taxing agencies.
(ii) That portion of said levied taxes
each year in excess of such amount in
(i) above, shall be allocated to and when
collected shall be paid into a special
fund of the agency to pay the principal
of and interest on bonds, loans, monies
advanced to, or indebtedness (whether
funded, refunded, assumed, or
otherwise) incurred by the Agency to
finance or refinance, in whole or in part,
a redevelopment project. Unless and
until the total assessed value of the
taxable property in the project area
exceeds the total assessed value of the
taxable property in the project area as
shown by the last equalized assessment
roll referred to in paragraph (i) hereof,
all of the taxes levied and collected
upon the taxable property in the project
area shall be paid into the funds of the
respective taxing agencies. When said
bonds, loans, advances, and
indebtedness, if any, and interest
thereon, have been paid, all monies
thereafter received from taxes upon the
taxable property in the project shall be
paid into funds of the respective taxing
agencies as taxes on all other property
are paid.
(iii) The portion of taxes mentioned in
paragraph (i) above may be pledged for
the payment of the principal of and
interest on the advance of monies, or
making of loans, or the incurring of any
indebtedness (whether funded,
refunded, assumed, or otherwise) by the
Agency to finance or refinance a
redevelopment project in whole or in
part. The Agency is authorized to make
such pledges as to specific advances,
loans and indebtedness as appropriate in
carrying out the project.
(9) Implementation of Redevelopment Projects.
If the Agency undertakes any redevelopment
projects, it will be on an annual implementation
basis. Each annual implementation program shall be
included in the Redevelopment Plan and the
municipal budget. Programs and projects developed
shall be consistent with the stated goals and
objectives of the Plan. The projects to be initiated
during the period commencing April 1983 and ending
April 1984, which period shall be known as the first
action year, are as follows:
(a) Make application to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development for funds to acquire property
through negotiation, provide for relocation
assistance, clear inappropriate structures,
provide for sidewalk and parking
improvements, bury overhead power lines,
and rehabilitate substandard housing units
which are not suitable for clearance or
commercial use.
(b) Determine the amounts of funds which
may be available through tax increment
financing and program those increments to
assist in the accomplishment of the above,
as well as provide for the rehabilitation of
suitable existing commercial structures.
(c) Investigate alternate financing
mechanisms for downtown rehabilitation
such as formation of a Local Development
Corporation (Small Business
Administration Program).
(d) Undertake planning studies to
determine the market needs of the project
area and provide a schematic plan of the
downtown area with reference to building
facade improvements, parking
arrangements, traffic movements and other
capital facilities needed.
(e) Assist the redevelopment or
rehabilitation of the Anderson Lumber
Company at 2nd East and Main Street.
(f) Assist the redevelopment of the motel
and adjacent property on Main Street on
the west side of the Malad River.
(10) General Design Objectives. The design of
particular elements should be such that a
redevelopment project will:
(a) Provide an attractive urban
environment.
(b) Blend harmoniously with the adjoining
areas.
(c) Provide for the optimum amount of
open space in relation to new buildings, if
any.
(d) Provide unobtrusive parking areas,
appropriately screened and landscaped to
blend harmoniously with the area.
(e) Provide open spaces and pedestrian
walks which are oriented to the directions
of maximum use and designed to derive
benefit from topographical conditions and
views.
(f) Provide for the maximum separation
and protection of pedestrian access routes
from vehicular traffic arteries.
7-6 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
(11) Conformance of Redevelopment Plan to
Tremonton's Master Plan. A strong and viable
Central Business District has been the objective of
the Master Plan developed by and for the City of
Tremonton. This Redevelopment Plan reinforces that
concern.
The guidelines for development encourage downtown
redevelopment which would strengthen its viability.
The Redevelopment Plan conforms to and promotes
the Master Plan's intent.
7-216. Report on Project Area Redevelopment
Plan. Pursuant to and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 11-19-14, Utah Code
Annotated 1953, as amended, the following report is
presented:
(1) The Reasons for the Selection of the Project
Area. The proposed redevelopment area was selected
as that area within the City of Tremonton having the
most immediate need for treatment to stabilize,
strengthen, and expand the commercial base of the
community. The boundaries of the project area were
arrived at after a review of the whole business district
by members of the Redevelopment Agency in
collaboration with the consultants. Planned treatment
of the project area will prevent and eliminate blight,
stimulate new development and upgrade generally to
the degree necessary for sound long-range growth
and development.
(2) The Description of the Physical, Social, and
Economic Conditions Existing in the Area.
Physical:
Social:
Economic:
(3) Financial Analysis. See Section 7-216(H)
herein for proposed methods of financing
redevelopment of the project area. Although the
direction of assessed valuation and gross taxable
sales in the project area has yet to be fully
determined, the city-wide assessed valuation
increased. The intent of the Redevelopment Plan is
to sustain such growth in valuation. The
Redevelopment Plan encourages commercial
revitalization and expansion in the project area and
subsequent increases in gross taxable sales. It also
attempts to encourage development in the Tremonton
Central Business District rather than outside or in
another community.
(4) A method or plan for the relocation of
families and persons to be temporarily or
permanently displaced from housing facilities, if any,
in the project area will be prepared. During the
annual increment beginning April 1983, it is not
anticipated that there will be any relocation activities.
If otherwise, the Agency shall comply with the
Federal Uniform Relocation Act as adopted in 1971
and amended from time to time and the State
Relocation Act. It is the intent of the Redevelopment
Agency to promulgate relocation standards and
provide assistance to any displaced persons or
business as a result of government action by the
Agency.
(5) An Analysis of the Preliminary Plans.
(a) Basis for Termination of Land Use Plan
Elements - All land uses and densities
determined appropriate for the
Redevelopment Plan are in accord with the
general guidelines of the Master Plan and
the applicable Planning and Zoning Codes
of Tremonton. Major circulation routes are
as provided by the City's Major Street Plan.
(b) Basis for Planning Criteria - Planning
criteria (relative to land uses, population
densities, building intensities, characteristics
of internal circulation systems, and need and
type of public improvements) have not
specifically been set forth in the Plan. It was
felt that maximum flexibility in the
development of acquired land and assistance
to private development was needed to
achieve the highest quality development that
would be consistent with the City's longrange
plans for redevelopment of the Central
Business District. Each development
proposal will be considered as a conditional
use and planned unit development, thus
subject to the provisions of applicable
requirements of the City's Master Plan and
Land Development Code as well as all other
applicable development Codes and
Ordinances.
(c) Conformity with General Plan and
Relationship to Local Objectives - The
Redevelopment Plan conforms with the
Master Plan of Tremonton City in that it
relates to the definite and local objectives of
retaining and promoting an economically
healthy and growing business district by
providing adequate and desirable locations
for redevelopment and uses within an
atmosphere which will encourage growth.
The Plan is related to local objectives in that
the land use proposals will strengthen and
increase the range of activities within the
downtown area, order and visual identity
will be provided (through a variety of design
principles) thus creating a healthy and
pleasing environment for shopping,
working, and living, public improvements
will be upgraded in the area thereby
eliminating hazards and unsightliness, and
adequate off-street parking will be provided
in any new development.

(6) The Report and Recommendation of the
Planning Commission. See below.
TREMONTON PLANNING COMMISSION
June 9, 1981
Mayor Reese Mason
Chairman
Tremonton City Redevelopment Agency
City Administration Center
Tremonton, Utah 84337
Dear Mayor Mason,
Pursuant to Section 11-19-10 of the Utah
Neighborhood Development Act, the Tremonton
Planning Commission has reviewed the proposed
preliminary Redevelopment Plan for the Tremonton
Central Business District. It is our understanding that
this plan, when finalized, will establish the legal
framework within which the City may undertake
future redevelopment projects to meet specific needs
and goals of Tremonton.
We have determined that this program is
consistent with our Master Plan for Tremonton and
will enhance the long term economic growth of the
City by increasing its economic base and at the same
time arrest further obsolescence and deterioration in
the Central Business District. Therefore, the
Planning Commission recommends adoption of the
proposed Redevelopment Plan.
Sincerely,
William H. Myers, Chairman
Tremonton Planning Commission
Part 7-250. Tremonton Downtown Survey
7-251. Service and Market Area. The service
area of downtown Tremonton comprises Box Elder
County except for the communities of Brigham City,
Mantua, Perry, and Willard, and the southern Idaho
communities of Malad, Stone, and Strevell.
The major areas of competition are Brigham City and
Logan plus the large metropolitan areas of Ogden and
Salt Lake City. The principal competition is Brigham
City which shares the same service area as
Tremonton plus the south county area not serviceable
by Tremonton. To compete with Brigham City,
Tremonton will have to match or exceed the levels of
service available in Brigham City and demonstrate
the fashionableness and economy of shopping in
Tremonton as opposed to the larger centers.
Projected growth for the service area is a 35%
increase in population over the next five (5) years,
based on 2,000 new jobs committed by existing
manufacturing plants.
7-252. Land Use. Land uses in downtown
Tremonton include residential single family,
residential multi-family, retail sales and services,
financial institutions, business offices and services,
personal services, storage buildings and areas, vacant
lots, vacant buildings, and unused space in buildings.
Generally the wide variety of land uses expected in a
regional center are found in Tremonton and are in the
downtown area because outlying shopping centers
have not fragmented the consolidated development.
The lack of high density housing is considered a
major problem in and near the downtown area.
7-253. Floor Space. Existing floor space in the
downtown study area was divided into the following
categories:
(1) Personal Services and Apparel 53,275 sq. ft.
(2) Food 26,850 sq. ft.
(3) Hardware 44,900 sq. ft.
(4) Transportation 56,875 sq. ft.
(5) Medical 11,425 sq. ft.
(6) Offices and Business Services 55,600 sq. ft.
(7) Other 67,950 sq. ft.
(8) Housing 70,250 sq. ft.
(9) Vacant 52,025 sq. ft.
7-254. Disposable Income. There is an estimated
35.5 million dollars of annual taxable retail sales in
Tremonton, which serves a market area of about
16,000 population which has about 61 million dollars
of disposable income. (It is estimated that per capita
disposable income is $3,793.00). These figures
suggest that Tremonton is losing 42% of the
disposable income of its market area to the outside.
A 38%+ increase in disposable income is expected
over the next five (5) years (an increase of 23 million
dollars).
7-255. Age, Type of Construction, and Condition
of Buildings. Buildings date from new to about 77
years old (the earliest construction in 1904), and are
mostly single story masonry construction, with some
two stories high. Some downtown renewal has taken
place in recent years through redevelopment by
remodeling and conversion of land and buildings to
new uses.
The age of most buildings suggests that without an
engineering study to the contrary, the buildings do
not meet seismic standards considered essential for
7-8 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
public safety. In fact, all buildings in Tremonton can
be considered suspect with possibly only a few
exceptions among the newest buildings recently
constructed. The cost of correcting deficiencies in
buildings to meet minimum recommended seismic
standards is believed to be exorbitant. Therefore, all
other things being equal, a policy of building
replacement should be encouraged rather than one of
building conservation, to help correct the potential
safety problems. Perhaps even an aggressive policy
of building analysis and upgrading to meet current
public safety codes should be adopted.
Basically buildings should be replaced with safer
structures rather than remain and present potential
safety hazards to the public. However, the need may
not be so compelling that all buildings need be
required to upgrade immediately, and thus allow the
process to occur over an extended period by attrition
and encouragement.
7-256. Services and Utilities. Basic services and
utilities available in downtown Tremonton:
Water Police
Sewer Fire
Power Solid Waste Removal
Gas Street Maintenance
Telephone Street Lighting
Municipal Administration
Both streets and alleys have been developed as utility
corridors, power and telephone are aerial but the
telephone installations are now being buried. All
services appear to be adequate for the present and
designed for expected growth or are being so. No
major deficiencies are anticipated during the next five
years except the visual effects of aerial power and
telephone lines.
7-257. Public Improvements (Off-site). There is
a modern City Administrative Center, a newly
reconstructed Main Street and other adequate
community facilities, but there are sections of the
downtown area in need of curb, gutter, sidewalk, or
street paving either because of deterioration or nonexistence.
This includes improvements on both
streets and alleys.
7-258. General Appearance - Aesthetics.
Downtown Tremonton appears as a typical growing
U.S. small town Main Street, except for some
vacancies and going out of business signs. Basically
post World War II in character, the range of building
ages is offset by modernized store fronts. No
outstanding style is common nor is it believed that
one could be imposed. Therefore, the future
character and appearance lies in new contemporary
buildings, remodeling of existing ones, and such
beautification as can be achieved with landscaping.
The character achieved will contribute to the
competitive attractiveness of Tremonton with other
business centers.
7-259. Size of Blocks, Lots, and Ownership
Patterns. Blocks including alleys vary in size from
about 2-1/4 acres to 2-3/4 acres and are divided by
17-foot alleys. The lots were originally 150 feet deep
and 25 or 50 feet wide. Today there is both the
division of and combining of lots in ownership. The
sizes and dimensions of the blocks and lots and
ownership patterns present problems for
contemporary type development and redevelopment.
Ninety-four (94) parcels of private land are included
in this survey. Some are multiple lots under single
ownership and none are adjoining lots of same
ownership. Single ownership includes related
ownership such as M. H. King and Hermon E. King
where Kings Store is located. Most of the land is
owned by absentee landlords or at least nonoccupying
landlords. Experience suggests that there
is great difficulty in managing multiple parcels under
a variety of ownerships. Programs for improvement
of multiple ownership areas are limited and difficult
at best, and are hard pressed to compete with single
ownership or management developments such as
modern shopping centers.
7-260. Circulation and Parking. There are no
major problems of circulation in the present
downtown. However, as the downtown expands
either west across the railroad or east to and beyond
the Malad River, serious circulation bottlenecks will
be created on Main Street, unless additional east-west
streets are provided both north and south of Main
Street.
The 1,324 parking spaces counted in downtown
Tremonton are basically adequate for normal hours of
operation but not for heavy shopping days or hours.
The 360 on-street parking spaces (particularly along
Main Street) are not sufficient for downtown needs,
and the number could vary significantly with changes
to parallel parking from existing angle parking. The
589 parking spaces in the parking lots to the rear and
sides of stores, etc., are not located to be readily
observed and accessible to many of the business
establishments on Main Street, nor are many of them
designed or organized for efficiency. In fact, in some
cases it is difficult to differentiate from on-street
parking due to the absence of curb, gutter and
sidewalk. Growth of downtown business activities
will require additional well organized parking
convenient to the user destinations. Since there is no
way to expand on-street parking, off-street parking
lots will have to be provided to maintain desirability
for downtown business. New downtown expansion
areas must be required to provide for adequate and
MUNICIPAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROJECTS 7-9
convenient parking for their success as well as for
reinforcement of the present downtown.
7-261. Assessed Value. The 1980 assessed value
of the study area was $726,310.00 for 94 parcels in
private ownership wherein adjacent parcels in single
ownership were considered a single lot. There are
some owners who own non-contiguous lots in the
study area. Since contract sales and owners of
interest are not listed -- only owners of record on the
tax rolls – definitive ownership is difficult if not
impossible to establish for the entire area. The
assessed value is 20% of fair market value which
would then be $3,608.550.00.
7-262. Public Attitudes. Interviews with some
representative citizens and officials of Tremonton
indicate the resident shoppers preference for personal
attention usually found in small shops in Tremonton
rather than the usual anonymity in the larger chain
stores in larger centers. The price of commodities in
many cases appears to be less important than the
shoppers being on a first name basis with the
manager and sales people or cashiers. Residents
from outlying communities west and north often have
business in either Tremonton or Brigham City so the
wife may shop while the husband handles other
affairs or vice versa. A general feeling was perceived
that the residents of the area would appreciate a new
supermarket in Tremonton and patronize it rather
than look to Brigham City or other areas where new
and attractive facilities exist.
Partial findings from a questionnaire given to
downtown merchants and owners include a concern
about possible loss of business to the outside. A
general feeling was detected that expansion was
needed but that it should be contiguous to or near the
present downtown district, not in an outlying area.
There was an expression of willingness to support
downtown revitalization by serving on advisory
committees, committing to invest private capital, and
support civic and municipal efforts to assure a strong
business center.
7-263. Deficient Goods and Services. Aside from
the usual complaints about variety and prices of
available goods, the modern supermarket facilities
(Safeway and Carl & Don's food stores in
Tremonton) are less than half what could be expected
to serve the market area. With Safeway's lease
expiring there has been a lot of interest and
competition among developers to provide a new site
for an enlarged supermarket with such satellite
businesses as can be attracted into adjoining space.
The City has been compelled to review several sites
located in, by, and outlying the Central Business
District. The choice of sites for the next supermarket
and mutually supporting shopping center will have a
strong influence on the Central Business District. It
should be understood that the larger the commercial
center the more competitive it can be. Thus the size
of the market area and the concentration or size of the
services directly affect its ability to satisfy market
demand.
RECOMMENDATIONS
7-264. Expand and Consolidate Business. The
two basic alternative growth patterns facing
Tremonton commercial expansion are consolidation
of new growth into the existing downtown center and
established satellites, or scattered fragmentation of
business into random multi-centers. Also, it is
important to recognize that the larger the center the
more the opportunity to provide comprehensive
services. It is recommended that the City adopt a
strict policy of consolidated commercialization,
encourage and facilitate the commercialization
through regulations, public facilities and services,
intensified use and redevelopment as necessary to
assure a viable downtown center with competitive
enterprises.
Also, it is recommended that only sites in or adjacent
to the Central Business District be considered in
keeping with the recommended policy of business
consolidation. This step in the growth of the business
community is so important that the City should
consider using its available resources to assure the
availability of a proper site. Other business activities
should be encouraged the same way – locate
correctly to assure success in the entire business
community.
7-265. Grow to Serve Better. The anticipated
35% population growth in the next five (5) years will
continue to foster speculation in commercial land
development, such as businesses in outlying areas on
cheap land. It is felt that the growth challenges offer
the opportunity to enhance Tremonton's traditional
role of being the business center for northern Box
Elder County by providing comprehensive
convenient one-stop service. This would mean
improved selection through a variety of choice,
competition and good prices, convenience and
accessibility. It requires reasonable locations and
relationships, and the satisfying feeling and
confidence that people get from the assurance they
are in the right place to do their business rather than a
stop gap or interim activity until they can get to
where they really want to be. The successful center
must respond to the needs of the people by providing
appropriate goods and services competitively and
conveniently. This can best be accomplished in a
consolidated system that is large enough to respond
quickly and anticipate purchaser needs. It is
recommended that the business community plan to
7-10 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
serve the new larger population in its market area
better, with more attractive selection and competition
rather than allow business to go to more competitive
regional centers in the state.
7-266. Street Improvements and Storm
Drainage. Some sections of street improvements
need replacing and some have not yet been installed.
Two blocks are not included in the storm drainage
system. The attractiveness and function of the
downtown area should be considered essential for
prosperous business activities. It is therefore
recommended that street improvements and storm
drainage facilities be completed and maintained in
the downtown area.
7-267. Plan and Design for Success. The general
accessibility of the Central Business District is
reasonably good since it is located on a major
circulation route. However, existing parking
resembles the general make-up of the Central
Business District in that it lacks efficient structure.
This inefficient structure of the Central Business
District makes it subject to the temptation to abandon
it in favor of building new more efficient centers out
away from the center of development in locations
where land may be cheap but where development
competes to the detriment of the traditional business
center rather than reinforcing it. It is recommended
that the Central Business District be planned and
designed to achieve specific business goals
compatible with land owner, businessmen, and
community interests. Great power is necessary to
accomplish such a program and such power comes
through unity of purpose and action. Therefore it is
further recommended that the Central Business
District owners and businessmen be organized to
work together with City officials to establish
common goals and mutually acceptable methods of
solving problems and achieving the common goals.
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS the Central Business District of
Tremonton, Utah has been the commercial center of
northern Box Elder County, and
WHEREAS the population of northern Box
Elder County is growing rapidly and is projected to
grow rapidly for the foreseeable future due to the
announced establishment of some new industries and
the expansion of others, and
WHEREAS there are and have been substantial
threats of commercial development outside the
Central Business District contrary to the Master Plan,
and
WHEREAS the economic welfare of the
community is dependent on a strong and competitive
Central Business District,
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that
the Central Business District of Tremonton generally
described as the area from the railroad tracks on the
west to the Malad River on the east, and from and
including First South Street on the south to and
including First North on the north (see legal
description in Section 7-211) be surveyed to
determine the adequacy of the Central Business
District and its buildings, land, and improvements to
serve the growing market area, and what problems
exist which might prevent it from adequately serving
the growing market area, to the detriment of the
citizens of Tremonton. Such study and survey are to
be conducted pursuant to Utah Neighborhood
Development Act (Title 11-19).

7-312. Determination of Costs; Finding. All
costs and expenses for the making of the
improvements within the District have been
determined, the property price for all property to be
acquired to make the improvements has been finally
determined and the reasonable cost of any work to be
done has been determined. The City Council (the
"Council") of Tremonton City, Box Elder County,
Utah (the "Issuer") hereby finds and determines that
the improvements for which the assessments
authorized herein are made have a reasonable useful
life of at least twenty (20) years.
7-313. Approval of Assessment List; Findings.
The City Council (the "Council") of Tremonton City,
Box Elder County, Utah (the "Issuer") hereby
confirms the assessment roll as approved by the
Board of Equalization and Review for Tremonton
City, Utah Special Improvements District No. 1 (The
"District"), a copy of which is included in Section 7-
326 herein, (the "Assessment List"), and hereby
confirms the findings of the Board of Equalization
and Review that the assessment list as equalized by
the Board of Equalization and Review for the district
is just and equitable; that each piece of property to be
assessed within the district will be benefitted in an
amount not less than the assessment to be levied
against said property; and that no piece of property
listed in the assessment list will bear more than its
proportionate share of the cost of such improvements.
A list of property owners and property description is
included in Section 7-327 herein. Warranty deeds are
listed in Section 7-328.
7-314. Levy of Assessments. The Council of the
Issuer does hereby levy an assessment to be assessed
upon the real property identified in the Assessment
List. The assessments levied upon each parcel of
property therein described shall be in the amount set
forth in the Assessment List.
The assessments hereby levied are for the purpose of
paying the costs of construction of certain culinary
water system improvements and the completion of
any miscellaneous work necessary to complete the
improvements in a proper and workmanlike manner.
Said improvements are more particularly described in
the Assessment List.
The assessments are hereby levied and assessed upon
each of the parcels of real property described in the
assessment list to the extent that they are specially
benefitted by the improvements acquired or
constructed within the District. The assessments are
levied upon the parcels of land in the District at equal
and uniform rates.
7-315. Cost of Improvements; Amount of Total
Assessments. The total cost of the improvements in
the District is $164,142.80, of which total cost the
Issuer's portion is $11,200.00. The Issuer's portion
for the District includes that part of the overhead
7-2 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
costs for which an assessment cannot be levied, if
any, and the cost of making improvements for the
benefit of property against which an assessment may
not be levied, if any. The amount to be assessed
against property affected or benefitted by the
improvements in the District is $152,942.80, which
amount does not exceed in the aggregate the sum of:
(a) the total contract price or prices for the
improvements under contract duly let to the lowest
and best responsible bidders therefor; (b) the
reasonable cost of utility services, maintenance,
labor, materials or equipment supplied by the Issuer,
if any; (c) the property price, if any; (d) connection
fees, if any; (e) the interest on any interim warrants
issued against the District; (f) overhead costs not to
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the sum of (a), (b),
(c) and (d); and (g) where the assessment is levied
prior to the time all of the improvements in the
district are entirely completed and accepted, an
amount for contingencies of not to exceed 10% of the
sum of (a), (b) and (c).
7-316. Method and Rate. The total assessment for
the District is levied in accordance with the following
method and at the following rates:
Method of Rate of
Improvement Assessment Assessment
Water Line Extension Per Front Foot $21.13
and Pump Station
7-317. Payment of Assessments. The whole or
any part of the assessments for the District may be
paid without interest within fifteen (15) days after
this Ordinance becomes effective. Any part of the
assessment not paid within such fifteen (15) day
period shall be payable over a period of twenty (20)
years from the effective date of this Ordinance in
twenty (20) annual principal installments together
with interest on the unpaid balance of the assessment
at the same rate as the rate of rates of the special
assessment bonds anticipated to be issued by the
Issuer. The assessment payment dates shall be the
first anniversary date of the effective date of this
Ordinance and each subsequent anniversary date
thereafter. Interest shall accrue from the effective
date of this Ordinance until paid.
After the above-referenced fifteen (15) day period, all
unpaid installments of an assessment levied against
any piece of property may be paid prior to the dates
on which they become due, but any such prepayment
must include an additional amount equal to the
interest which would accrue on the assessment to the
next succeeding date on which interest is payable on
any special assessment bonds issued in anticipation
of the collection of the assessments plus such
additional amount as, in the opinion of the City
Treasurer, is necessary to assure the availability of
money to pay interest on the special assessment
bonds as interest becomes due and payable plus any
premiums which may be charged and become
payable on redeemable bonds which may be called in
order to utilize the assessments paid in advance.
7-318. Default in Payment. If a default occurs in
the payment of any installment of principal or
interest, when due, the Issuer may declare the unpaid
amount to be immediately due and payable and
subject to collection as provided herein. In addition,
it may accelerate payment of the total unpaid balance
of the assessment and declare the whole of the unpaid
principal and interest then due to be immediately due
and payable. Interest shall accrue and be paid on all
amounts declared to be delinquent or accelerated and
immediately due and payable at the rate of 18% per
annum until the next succeeding date after payment
or collection on which interest is payable on any
special assessment bonds issued. Costs of collection
as provided by the Issuer or required by law shall be
charged and paid on all amounts declared to be
delinquent or accelerated and immediately due and
payable.
Upon any default, the City Treasurer shall give
notice, in writing, of the default to the owner of the
property in default, as shown by the last available
equalized assessment rolls. Notice shall be effective
upon deposit of the notice in the U.S. Mail, postage
prepaid, and addressed to the owner as shown on the
last equalized assessment rolls, for the Issuer or on
the official ownership records of the Issuer. The
notice shall provide for a period of thirty (30) days in
which the owner shall pay the installments then due
and owing, after which the Issuer may accelerate the
principal of the assessment and immediately
commence foreclosure proceedings in the manner
provided for actions to foreclose mortgage liens or
trust deeds. If at the sale no person or entity shall bid
and pay the Issuer the amount due on the assessment
plus interest and costs, the property shall be deemed
sold to the Issuer for these amounts. The Issuer shall
be permitted to bid at the sale.
The remedies provided herein for the collection of
assessments and the enforcement of liens shall be
deemed and construed to be cumulative and the use
of any one method or means of collection or
enforcement shall not deprive the Issuer of the use of
any other method or means. The amounts of accrued
interest and all costs of collection shall be added to
the amount of the assessment up to the date of
foreclosure sale.
7-319. Remedy of Default. If prior to the final
date payment may be legally made under a final sale
or foreclosure of property to collect delinquent
MUNICIPAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROJECTS 7-3
assessment installments, the property owner pays the
full amount of all unpaid installments which are past
due and delinquent with interest at the rate of 18%
per annum to the date of payment, plus all approved
or required costs, the assessment of said owner shall
be restored and the default removed, and thereafter
the owner shall have the right to make the payments
in installments as if the default had not occurred.
7-320. Lien of Assessment. An assessment or any
part or installment of it, any interest accruing and the
penalties and costs of collection shall constitute a lien
against the property upon which the assessment is
levied on the effective date of this Ordinance. Said
lien shall be superior to the lien of any trust deed,
mortgage, mechanic's or materialman's lien or other
encumbrance and shall be equal to and on a parity
with the lien for general property taxes. The lien
shall continue until the assessment and any interest,
penalties and costs on it are paid, notwithstanding
any sale of the property for or on account of a
delinquent general property tax, special tax or other
assessment or the issuance of tax deed, an
Assignment of Interest by the governing entity or a
Sheriff's Certificate of Sale or Deed.
7-321. Special Improvement Guaranty Fund.
The Issuer does hereby create a Special Improvement
Guaranty Fund and shall annually, so long as any
special assessment bonds of the Issuer remain
outstanding, transfer to said fund each year such
amount as shall equal the amount that a tax levy on
all taxable property located within the Issuer at the
rate of .0002 will produce, either through a levy of a
tax of not to exceed .0002 in any one year or by the
issuance of general obligation bonds or by
appropriation from other available sources, for the
purpose of guaranteeing to the extent of such fund the
payment of special assessment bonds and interest
thereon issued against local improvement districts for
the payment of local improvements therein, all in the
manner and to the extent provided by the laws of the
State of Utah.
7-322. Contestability. No assessment shall be
declared void or set aside in whole or in part in
consequence of any error or irregularity which does
not go to the equity or justice of the assessment or
proceeding. Any party who has not waived his
objections to same as provided by statute may
commence a civil action against the Issuer to enjoin
the levy or collection of the assessment or to set aside
and declare unlawful this Ordinance.
Such action must be commenced and summons must
be served on the Issuer not later than 30 days after the
effective date of this Ordinance. This action shall be
the exclusive remedy of any aggrieved party. No
court shall entertain any complaint which the party
was authorized to make by statute but did not timely
make and/or complaint that does not concern the
equity or justice of the assessment or proceeding.
After the expiration of the 30-day period provided in
this section:
(1) The special assessment bonds issued or to be
issued against the District and the assessments levied
in the District shall become incontestable as to all
persons who have not commenced the action
provided for in this section; and
(2) No suit to enjoin the issuance or payment of
the bonds, the levy, collection or enforcement of the
assessment, or in any other manner attacking or
questioning the legality of the bonds or assessments
may be instituted in this state, and no court shall have
authority to inquire into these matters.
7-323. All Necessary Action Approved. The
officials of the Issuer are hereby authorized and
directed to take all action necessary and appropriate
to effectuate the provisions of this Ordinance.
7-324. Repeal of Conflicting Provisions. All
Ordinances or parts thereof in conflict with this
Ordinance are hereby repealed.
7-325. Publication of Ordinances. Immediately
after its adoption, this Ordinance shall be signed by
the Mayor and City Recorder and shall be recorded in
the Ordinance Book kept for that purpose. This
Ordinance shall be published once in The Leader, a
newspaper having general circulation in the Issuer,
and shall take effect immediately upon its passage
and approval and publication as required by law.

Development Review Committee for evaluation. The
Development Review Committee shall notify the
Applicant of the meeting whereby the Committee
shall evaluate the proposed disposition and provide
the applicant with an opportunity to appear before the
Committee and present the request of the applicant.
After considering the information provided by the
Applicant for disposal of real property and reviewing
the submitted Application, the Development Review
Committee shall classify the subject property as either
“Significant Real Property” or “Insignificant Real
Property” and thereafter make a recommendation to
the City Council for or against the proposed
disposition. This classification of the property shall
be based on the criteria in this section.
(4) Property considered “Significant City Real
Property” will have one or more of the following
attributes:
(a) Real property that has a national,
regional, or local historic feature, which may
include, but is not limited to: real property
classified upon its acquisition or thereafter
by the City as viewsheds or viewpoints,
outdoor classrooms, and/or scenic and
historic corridors.
(b) Real property that has an ecological
feature not susceptible of economically
reasonable mitigation, which may include,

restrictions, or real property exacted from a
person and the City has owned said real
property for less than 15 years, unless the
person who granted the property to City
declines to have it reconveyed to them as per

(5) Real Property considered “Insignificant Real
Property” will have one or more of the following
attributes:

remnant parcel surrounded by development
and not received originally as viewshed,
required buffer or required open space.
(c) The parcel is not defined as having
cultural or ecological significance.
(d) The disposal of the real property will
not cause a violation of the standards in the
Development Code by surrounding or

(e) The parcel no longer serves a public
purpose or the purpose that was originally
intended for the land is not viable.
(6) Upon receipt of the classification of the
subject property and the recommendation from the
Land Use Authority, the City Council may decide to
terminate the proposal and vote to not dispose of
either Insignificant or a Significant parcel of real
property.
If the City Council determines to proceed with
the Application for disposal, then the City Council
shall reaffirm or amend the Development Review
Committee’s classification as a “Significant Real
Property” or “Insignificant Real Property” using the
same criteria contained in this section. If the City
Council classifies the real property proposed for
disposal as “Insignificant Real Property” of the City,
the City Council may consider and approve the
disposition of the parcel without a public hearing. If
the City Council classifies the subject real property as
“Significant Real Property”, a public hearing shall be
scheduled and the City shall provide reasonable
notice for the public hearing which shall include, at a
minimum, a fourteen (14) day notice period with a
notice being published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least twice.
(7) At the public hearing, the City Council shall
receive public comments on the Application. After
the close of the public hearing, the City Council may
consider and decide whether or not to dispose of the
City owned real property.
Every disposition of City real property shall
require the payment to the City of a sum set by the
City Council in the vote to approve the disposition of
the City property. The City Council may require an
estimated value in writing from the Box Elder County
Assessor or other appraisal authority as determined
appropriate by the City Council in considering the
value required to be received by the City in exchange
for disposal of the City real property, and the
Applicant shall be required to reimburse the City for
any additional costs associated with the disposition
such as surveying costs etc.
(8) In addition to process contained in this
Ordinance the City shall follow the processes
contained in U.C.A. § 10-9a-608 and 10-9a-609 for
vacating, altering or amending a subdivision plat and
U.C.A. § 10-9a-609.5 for vacating a street, right-ofway,
or easement and the Applicant shall pay the fee
associated with these process, as contained in the
City’s Consolidated Fee Schedule, adopted by

CHAPTER 8-300. TELECOMMUNICATIONS
RIGHTS-OF-WAY ORDINANCE
8-301. Declaration of Findings and Intent; Scope
of Ordinance.
(1) Declaration of Finding and Intent.
(a) Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way. The
City of Tremonton, Utah finds that the
Rights-of-Way within the City:
(i) are critical to the travel and
transport of persons and property in the
business and social life of the City;
(ii) are intended for public uses and
must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
(iii) can be partially occupied by the
facilities of utilities and other public
service entities delivering utility and
public services rendered for profit, to
the enhancement of the health, welfare,
and general economic well-being of the
City and its citizens; and
(iv) are a unique and physically limited
resource requiring proper management
to maximize the efficiency and to
minimize the costs to the taxpayers of
the foregoing uses and to minimize the
inconvenience to and negative effects
upon the public from such facilities'
construction, placement, relocation, and
maintenance in the Rights-of-Way.
(b) Finding Regarding Compensation. The
City finds that the City should receive fair
and reasonable compensation for use of the
Rights-of-Way.
(c) Finding Regarding Local Concern. The
City finds that while Telecommunications
Systems are in part an extension of interstate
commerce, their operations also involve
Rights-of-Way, municipal franchising, and
vital business and community service, which
are of local concern.
(d) Finding Regarding Promotion of
Telecommunications Services. The City
finds that it is in the best interests of its
taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid
development of Telecommunications
Services, on a nondiscrimination basis,
responsive to community and public interest,
and to assure availability for municipal,
educational and community services.
(e) Findings Regarding Franchise
Standards. The City finds that it is in the
interests of the public to Franchise and to
establish standards for franchising Providers
in a manner that:
(i) fairly and reasonably compensates
the City on a competitively neutral and
non-discriminatory basis as provided
herein;
(ii) encourages competition by
establishing terms and conditions under
which Providers may use the Rights-of-
Way to serve the public;
(iii) fully protects the public interests
and the City from any harm that may
flow from such commercial use of
Rights-of-Way;
(iv) protects the police powers and
Rights-of-Way management authority of
the City, in a manner consistent with
federal and state law;
(v) otherwise protects the public
interests in the development and use of
the City infrastructure;
(vi) protects the public's investment in
improvements in the Rights-of-Way;
and
(vii) ensures that no barriers to entry of
Telecommunications Providers are
created and that such franchising is
accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
Telecommunication Services, within the
meaning of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 ("Act") [P.L. No. 104-104].
(f) Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The
City adopts this Telecommunications
Ordinance pursuant to its power to manage
the Rights-of-Way, pursuant to common law,
the Utah Constitution and statutory
authority, and receive fair and reasonable,
compensation for the use of Rights-of-Way
by Providers as expressly set forth by

provide the basic local scheme for Providers of
Telecommunications Services and Systems that
require the use of the Rights-of-Way, including
Providers of both the System and Service, those
Providers of the System only, and those Providers
who do not build the System but who only provide
Services. This Ordinance shall apply to all future
Providers and to all Providers in the City prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance, whether operating
with or without a Franchise as set forth in Section (2)
of Part 8-312.

empowered and authorized to issue non-exclusive

and maintenance of Systems in the City's Rights-of-
Way, in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance. The Franchise is granted through a
Franchise Agreement entered into between the City
and Provider.
(2) Every Provider Must Obtain. Except to the
extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every Provider must obtain a
Franchise prior to constructing a Telecommunications
System or providing Telecommunications Services
using the Rights-of-Way, and every Provider must
obtain a Franchise before constructing an Open Video
System or providing Open Video Services via an
Open Video System. Any Open Video System or
Service shall be subject to the customer service and
8-4 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
consumer protection provisions applicable to the
Cable TV companies to the extent the City is not
preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a
court of competent jurisdiction, including any
appeals. The fact that particular Telecommunications
Systems may be used for multiple purposes does not
obviate the need to obtain a Franchise for other
purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a
cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable
franchise, and, should it intend to provide
Telecommunications Services over the same System,
must also obtain a Telecommunications Franchise.
(3) Nature of Grant. A Franchise shall not
convey title, equitable or legal, in the Rights-of-Way.
A Franchise is only the right to occupy Rights-of-
Way on a non-exclusive basis for the limited
purposes and for the limited period stated in the
Franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned,
or subleased. A Franchise does not excuse a Provider
from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its System on the
property of others, including the City's property. This
section shall not be construed to prohibit a Provider
from leasing conduit to another Provider, so long as
the Lessee has obtained a Franchise.

exempted by federal or state law, any Provider acting
without a Franchise on the effective date of this
Ordinance shall request issuance of a Franchise from
the City within 90 days of the effective date of this
Ordinance. If such request is made, the Provider may

by the City under the provisions of this Ordinance
shall be a nonexclusive Franchise providing the right
and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and

offering or providing any Services pursuant to the
Franchise, a Provider shall obtain any and all
regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or
licenses for the offering or provision of such Services
from the appropriate federal, state and local

(1) Compensation. As fair and reasonable
compensation for any Franchise granted pursuant to
this Ordinance, a Provider shall have the following
obligations:
(a) Application Fee. In order to offset the
cost to the City to review an Application for
a Franchise and in addition to all other fees,
permits or charges, a Provider shall pay to
the City, at the time of Application a nonrefundable
Application fee subject to the fee
amount contained in the City’s Consolidated
Fee Schedule, adopted by Resolution of the
City Council.
(b) Franchise Fees. The Franchise fee, if
any, shall be set forth in the Franchise
Agreement. The obligation to pay a
Franchise fee shall commence on the
Completion Date. The Franchise fee is
offset by any business license fee or business
license tax enacted by the City.
(c) Excavation Permits. The Provider shall
also pay fees required for an excavation
permit as provided in Chapter 11-300, Part
11-400, Excavation Permit Ordinance.
(2) Timing. Unless otherwise agreed to in the

on a monthly basis within forty-five (45) days of the
close of each calendar month.

payment shall be accompanied by a statement
showing the manner in which the fee was calculated
and shall be certified as to its accuracy.
(4) Future Costs. A Provider shall pay to the
City or to third parties, at the direction of the City, an
amount equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable
expenses that the City incurs for the services of third
parties (including but not limited to attorneys and
other consultants) in connection with any renewal or
Provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
Ordinance or a Franchise, provided, however, that the
parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at
the outset of negotiations. In the event the parties are
unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to
binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and
procedures of the American Arbitration Association.
(5) Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes
or other assessments are imposed by taxing
authorities, other than the City on the use of the City
property as a result of a Provider's use or occupation
of the Rights-of-Way, the Provider shall be
responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by
the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in
addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
Ordinance.
(6) Interest on Late Payments. In the event that
any payment is not actually received by the City on or
before the applicable date fixed in the Franchise,
CITY PROPERTY 8-5
interest thereon shall accrue from such date until
received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
(7) No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance
by the City of any fee shall be construed as an accord
that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor
shall such acceptance of such fee payment be
construed as a release of any claim the City may have
for additional sums payable.
(8) Not in Lieu of Other Taxes or Fees. The fee
payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or
other assessment except as specifically provided in
this Ordinance, or as required by applicable law. By
way of example, and not limitation, excavation permit
fees and fees to obtain space on the City owned poles
are not waived and remain applicable.
(9) Continuing Obligation and Holdover. In the
event a Provider continues to operate all or any part
of the System after the Term of the Franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable
provisions of this Ordinance and the Franchise,
including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of
such continued operation, provided that any such
continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the Franchise, nor as a
limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the
City as a result of such continued operation after the
term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution.
(10) Costs of Publication. A Provider shall
assume any publication costs associated with its
Franchise that may be required by law.

removal of the System shall be performed in a safe,
thorough and reliable manner using materials of good
and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined
by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by
federal law or the FCC to make such determination,
that any part of the System, including, without
limitation, any means used to distribute Signals over
or within the System, is harmful to the public health,

then a Provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
promptly correct all such conditions.

not apply to Systems originally located on
private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later
incorporated into the Rights-of-Way, if that
private easement grants a superior vested
right. This obligation exists whether or not

of the System, a Provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, protect any and all existing structures

prior written consent of the City to alter any water
main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or
any other municipal structure on, over or under the
Rights-of-Way of the City required because of the
presence of the System. Any such alteration shall be
made by the City or its designee on a reimbursable
basis. A Provider agrees that it shall be liable for the
costs incurred by the City to replace or repair and
restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be
reasonably specified by the City, any municipal
structure or any other Rights-of-Way of the City

upgrade or removal of the System that may become
disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon

Franchise.
(6) No Obstruction. In connection with the
construction, maintenance, upgrade, repair or removal

systems, railways, passenger travel, or other traffic to,
from or within the City without the prior consent of
the appropriate authorities.

state and local requirements including but not limited

the Provider, unless, in the sole determination of the
City, an eminent danger exists, any Rights-of-Way
within the City which are disturbed or damaged
during the construction, maintenance or
reconstruction by a Provider of its System may be
repaired by the City at the Provider's expense, to a
condition as good as that prevailing before such work
was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall

System in a non-dangerous condition
throughout the entire period of its Franchise.

representative of the City of the System and

applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement

System, and any part thereof, in accordance with the
provisions of the Franchise and applicable law. A
Provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and
controls to enable a Provider to prove, in reasonable
detail, to the satisfaction of the City at all times
throughout the Term, that a Provider is in compliance
with the Franchise. A Provider shall retain such
records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.
(3) Maintain Records. A Provider shall at all
times maintain:
(a) On file with the City, a full and
complete set of plans, records and "as-built"
hard copy maps and, to the extent the maps
are placed in an electronic format, they shall
be made in electronic format compatible
with the City's existing GIS system, of all
existing and proposed installations and the
types of equipment and Systems installed or
constructed in the Rights-of-Way, properly
identified and described as to the types of

prints." Maps shall be drawn to scale. "Asbuilt"
maps, including the compatible
electronic format, as provided above, shall
be submitted within 30 days of completion
of work or within 30 days after completion
of modification and repairs. "As- built"
maps are not required of the Provider who is
the incumbent local exchange carrier for the
existing System to the extent they do not
exist.
(b) Throughout the term of the Franchise, a
Provider shall maintain complete and
accurate books of account and records of the
business, ownership, and operations of a
Provider with respect to the System in a
manner that allows the City at all times to

determine whether a Provider is in
compliance with the Franchise. Should the
City reasonably determine that the records
are not being maintained in such a manner, a
Provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that
a Provider comes into compliance with this
Section. All financial books and records

the State of Utah, and generally accepted
accounting principles shall be deemed to be
acceptable under this Section.
(4) Confidentiality. If the information required
to be submitted is proprietary in nature or must be
kept confidential by federal, state or local law, upon
proper request by a Provider, such information shall
be classified as a Protected Record within the
meaning of the Utah Government Records Access
and Management Act ("GRAMA"), making it
available only to those who must have access to
perform their duties on behalf of the City, provided
that a Provider notifies the City of, and clearly labels
the information which a Provider deems to be
confidential, proprietary information. Such
notification and labeling shall be the sole
responsibility of the Provider.
(5) Provider's Expense. All reports and records
required under this Ordinance shall be furnished at
the sole expense of a Provider, except as otherwise
provided in this Ordinance or a Franchise.

books and records of the Provider pertaining thereto
shall be open to inspection or audit by duly
authorized representatives of the City at all
reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of
the intention to inspect or audit the books and
records, provided that the City shall not audit the
books and records of the Provider more often than
annually. The Provider agrees to reimburse the City
the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit discloses
that the Provider has paid ninety-five percent (95%)
or less of the compensation due the City for the
period of such audit. In the event the accounting
rendered to the City by the Provider herein is found to
be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the
corrected amount within thirty (30) calendar days of
written notice, it being agreed that the City may
accept any amount offered by the Provider, but the
acceptance thereof by the City shall not be deemed a
settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or
is later found to be incorrect.
8-309. Rights of City

(a) Enforcement - City Designee. The City
is responsible for enforcing and
administering this Ordinance, and the City or
its designee, as appointed by the Mayor or

revocation.
(2) Force Majeure. In the event a Provider's
performance of any of the terms, conditions or
obligations required by this Ordinance or a Franchise

section, causes or events not within the control of a
Provider shall include, without limitation, acts of
God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances,

CITY PROPERTY 8-9
days after no response to written notice
from the City to the last known address
of Provider;
(ii) any System has been installed in the
Rights-of-Way without complying with
the requirements of this Ordinance or
Franchise; or
(iii) the provisions of Part 8-303,
Section (5) are applicable and no
Franchise is granted, a Provider, except
the Provider who is an incumbent local
exchange carrier, shall be deemed to
have abandoned such System.
(b) Removal of Abandoned System. The
City, upon such terms as it may impose, may
give a Provider written permission to
abandon, without removing, any System, or
portion thereof, directly constructed,
operated or maintained under a Franchise.
Unless such permission is granted or unless
otherwise provided in this Ordinance, a
Provider shall remove within a reasonable
time the abandoned System and shall restore,
using prudent construction standards, any
affected Rights-of-Way to their former state
at the time such System was installed, so as
not to impair their usefulness. In removing
its plant, structures and equipment, a
Provider shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall
leave all Rights-of-Way in as good condition
as that prevailing prior to such removal
without materially interfering with any
electrical or telephone cable or other utility
wires, poles or attachments. The City shall
have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the Rights-of-Way cables,
wires, attachments and poles prior to and
after removal. The liability, indemnity and
insurance provisions of this Ordinance and
any security fund provided in a Franchise
shall continue in full force and effect during
the period of removal and until full
compliance by a Provider with the terms and
conditions of this Section.

a Provider, if required by the City, shall
submit to the City a written instrument,
satisfactory in form to the City, transferring
to the City the ownership of the abandoned
System.

the expiration of the term for which a
Franchise is granted, or upon its revocation
or earlier expiration, as provided for by this
Ordinance, in any such case without
renewal, extension or transfer, the City shall
have the right to require a Provider to
remove, at its expense, all above-ground
portions of a System from the Rights-of-
Way within a reasonable period of time,
which shall not be less than one hundred
eighty (180) days. If the Provider is the
incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall not
be required to remove its System, but shall
negotiate a renewal in good faith.
(e) Leaving Underground System.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Ordinance, a Provider may
abandon any underground System in place
so long as it does not materially interfere
with the use of the Rights-of-Way or with
the use thereof by any public utility, cable
operator or other Person.
8-310. Obligation to Notify
(1) Publicizing Work. Before entering onto any
private property, a Provider shall make a good faith
attempt to contact the property owners in advance,
and describe the work to be performed.
8-311. General Provisions
(1) Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between
any provision of this Ordinance and a Franchise
entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this
Ordinance in effect at the time the Franchise is
entered into shall control.
(2) Severability. If any provision of this
Ordinance is held by any federal, state or local court
of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting
with any federal or state statute, or is ordered by a
court to be modified in any way in order to conform
to the requirements of any such law and all appellate
remedies with regard to the validity of the Ordinance
provisions in question are exhausted, such provision
shall be considered a separate, distinct, and
independent part of this Ordinance, and such holding
shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all
other provisions hereof. In the event that such law is
subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or
otherwise changed, so that the provision which had
been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict
with such law the provision in question shall return to
full force and effect and shall again be binding on the
City and the Provider, provided that the City shall
give the Provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period
of time as may be reasonably required for a Provider
to comply with such a rejuvenated provision, written
notice of the change before requiring compliance with
such provision.
(3) New Developments. It shall be the policy of
the City to liberally amend this Ordinance, upon
Application of a Provider, when necessary to enable
the Provider to take advantage of any developments
in the field of Telecommunications which will afford
8-10 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
the Provider an opportunity to more effectively,
efficiently, or economically serve itself or the public.
(4) Notices. All notices from a Provider to the
City required under this Ordinance or pursuant to a
Franchise granted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be
directed to the officer as designated by the Mayor. A
Provider shall provide in any Application for a
Franchise the identity, address and phone number to
receive notices from the City. A Provider shall
immediately notify the City of any change in its name,
address, or telephone number.
(5) Exercise of Police Power. To the full extent
permitted by applicable law either now or in the
future, the City reserves the right to adopt or issue
such rules, regulations, orders, or other directives that
it finds necessary or appropriate in the lawful exercise
of its police powers.

construed in a manner consistent with all applicable
federal and state statutes.

shall apply to all Franchises granted or renewed after
the effective date of this Ordinance. This Ordinance
shall further apply, to the extent permitted by
applicable federal or state law to all existing
Franchises granted prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance and to a Provider providing Services,
without a Franchise, prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance.
(3) Other Applicable Ordinances. A Provider's
rights are subject to the police powers of the City to
adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health,
safety and welfare of the public. A Provider shall
comply with all applicable general laws and

Resolution on any person engaged in the business of
private instruction in the arts in the home on a part
time basis.
9-125. Fee Not to Constitute Undue Burden on
Interstate Commerce. None of the license taxes
provided for by Resolution shall be applied as to
occasion an undue burden on interstate commerce. In
any case, where a license tax is believed by a licensee
or applicant for license to place an undue burden
upon such commerce, he may apply to the license
assessor and collector for an adjustment of the tax so
that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable or
unfair as to such commerce. Such application may be
made before, at or within six (6) months after
payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant
shall, by affidavit and supporting testimony show his
method of business and the gross volume or
estimated gross volume of business and such other
information as the license assessor and collector may
deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if
any, of such undue burden on such commerce. The
license assessor and collector shall then conduct an
investigation, comparing applicant's business with
other businesses of like nature and shall make
findings of facts from which he shall determine
whether the tax fixed by resolution is discriminatory,
unreasonable or unfair as to applicant's business and
shall recommend to the City Council a license tax for
the applicant in an amount that is nondiscriminatory,
reasonable and fair, and if the City Council is
satisfied that such license tax is the amount that the
applicant should pay, it shall fix the license tax in
such amount. If the regular license tax has already
LICENSING, CONTROL AND REGULATION OF BUSINESS AND CONSTRUCTION 9-5
been paid, the City Council shall order a refund of the
amount over and above the tax fixed by the City
Council. In fixing the fee to be charged, the license
assessor and collector shall have the power to base
the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or
employees, or may use any other method which will
assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that
assessed on businesses of like nature.

complaint as deemed necessary, the Recorder may
cause a complaint and notice of hearing to be directed
to the licensee setting forth the violations alleged
against the licensee, and requesting the licensee,
within ten (10) days after service of the complaint

his commission of the act charged in the complaint.
The Recorder or the City Council may then
immediately begin disciplinary proceedings. The
Recorder shall set the hearing before the City Council
on any of the grounds set forth in subsection A of this
section. In carrying out his duties under this section,
the City Recorder and investigating officer shall have
all those rights and duties set forth in Section

testimony and apply the evidentiary rules prescribed
in Section 32-8-31 through 32-8-45, Utah Code
Annotated 1953. The City shall prepare an official
record of the hearing, including all testimony
recorded mechanically or stenographically and all
exhibits introduced. The City is not required to
transcribe such record except pursuant to an appeal,

fee for transcribing such record, the
department may transcribe the record or allow for its
transcription by the person requesting it.
(4) When the hearing is conducted by the
Council, the Council shall issue a decision within ten
(10) days following the hearing. Such decision shall
then be final for purposes of appeal to Circuit Court.
(5) Hearings before the City Council are open to
the public and are informal with technical rules of

the conduct of any hearing. The license involved and
any person requesting a hearing shall be notified in
the time and in the manner provided in Section

present and cross examine witnesses and give
evidence before the Council.

accordance with the applicable provisions of
this part, other applicable provisions of City
and State law and in accordance with the
guidelines established by the following
subsections hereafter.
(b) A license shall be permanently revoked
if the licensee knowingly submits false or
fraudulent, material information on any
application or document filed with the City
as a part of obtaining the license.
(c) Except where the provisions of this
ordinance or other applicable statutes
require the permanent revocation of a
license, a licensee who is found to have
violated any of the provisions of this part
may have his/her/its license suspended for a
maximum period of thirty (30) days for a
first offense, plus an assessment as provided
in the next subsection, for a maximum
period of thirty (30) days for a second
offense, plus an assessment as provided in
the next subsection, for a maximum period
of sixty (60) days for a third or subsequent
offense, plus an assessment as provided in
the next subsection. Provided, however, that
the City Council expressly reserves the right
to revoke a license if in its discretion, the
circumstances warrant such action and
regardless of whether the complaint and
circumstances upon which such revocation
is founded constitute the first, second, third
or subsequent offense. Revocation remains
an option for the City Council at any time
under appropriate circumstances. In
addition, if a period of two (2) years passes
between the date of the last offense by an
applicant, licensee, or any of his/her/its
managers, officers, directors, partners,
shareholders, agents or employees and the
next offense, then the first offense after said
two (2) year period shall be considered a
first offense for purposes of this part. Any
LICENSING, CONTROL AND REGULATION OF BUSINESS AND CONSTRUCTION 9-7
such offense(s) committed within one (1)
year prior to the adoption of this amendment
shall be considered a "first offense". The
City Council retains full discretion,
however, to suspend a license for a longer
period of time than the maximum stated
herein or to revoke a license permanently,
even though not specifically required by the
provisions of this ordinance, should the
circumstances of any particular violation, in
its judgment, warrant such action.
(d) In addition to the periods of suspension
stated in subsection 3, above, and as a
condition to the imposition of a suspension
period by the City Council for up to the
maximum periods of thirty (30) and sixty
(60) days respectively, as opposed to a
longer period of suspension, for a first,
second, third and subsequent violation, the
City Council may require the payment of an
assessment, with such assessments, when
collected, to be segregated into a separate
fund and separately accounted for as
provided in the next subsection, below.
Assessments are subject to the amount
contained in the City’s Consolidated Fee
Schedule, adopted by Resolution of the City
Council.
(e) All fees and assessments which are
collected pursuant to the provisions of
subsection 4, above, shall be segregated into
a separate fund which is hereby established
by the City and shall be known as the
Tremonton City Alcohol Enforcement and
Awareness Fund. The funds shall be subject
to the control of the City Council and shall
be used by the City for alcohol enforcement,
training and awareness programs. In the use
of said funds, the City may transfer all or a
part of the funds to the Police Department
for use in its budget in connection with
alcohol related activities or may be used for
training and awareness programs in the
public schools or otherwise.
(f) It is the intent of the City Council, by
these amendments and additions to the
City's "Intoxicants" ordinance, to provide a
more flexible and effective method by which
violations of the ordinance are dealt with
and the method whereby the sanctions which
are imposed upon a licensee for a violation
of this part may be formulated to apply
directly to the individual circumstances of
the licensee and the violation committed.
(g) All references in part 9-410,
"Intoxicants", to the Utah Liquor Control
Act shall be deemed to refer to the Utah
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, as it is now
known, and any succeeding act(s) adopted
hereafter, and all references to particular
sections of the prior Utah Liquor Control
Act shall be deemed to refer to their
successor sections whether now in effect or
hereafter adopted.

TITLE 9.
LICENSING, CONTROL AND
REGULATION OF BUSINESS AND
CONSTRUCTION.
CHAPTER 9-800. RESIDENTIAL
SOLICITATION.
9-801. Purpose. Residents of the City have an
inalienable interest in their personal safety, wellbeing,
and privacy in their residences, as well as their
ability to provide or receive information regarding
matters of personal belief, political or charitable
activities, and goods and services lawfully in
commerce. The City has a substantial interest in
protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety,
and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability
to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon
residential property. The City also has a substantial
interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise
unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal
activity.
There must be a balance between these substantial
interests of the City and its citizens, and the effect of
the regulations in this Chapter on the rights of those
who are regulated. Based on the collective
experiences of City officials derived from regulating
business activity, protecting persons and property
from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of
citizens regarding Door-to-Door Solicitation, the
experience of its law enforcement officers and those
affected by Door-to-Door canvassing and solicitation,
as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries
of constitutional protections afforded and denied
persons seeking to engage in Door-to-Door
Solicitation, the City adopts this Chapter to promote
the City’s substantial interests in:
(1) respecting citizen’s decisions regarding
privacy in their residences;
(2) protecting persons from criminal conduct;
(3) providing equal opportunity to Advocate for
and against Religious Belief, Political Position, or
Charitable Activities; and
(4) permitting truthful and non-misleading
Door-to-Door Solicitation regarding lawful Goods or
Services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
The City finds that the procedures, rules and
regulations set forth in this Chapter are narrowly
tailored to preserve and protect the City interests
referred to herein while at the same time balancing
the rights of those regulated.

work shall be received by the City prior to the release of
the bond.

insurance shall apply separately to each
insured against whom claim is made or suit is
brought, except with respect to the limits of
the insurer's liability.

policy or policies shall have no recourse
against the City for payment of any premiums

indemnify, save harmless and defend the City
and its officers and employees against any
claim or loss, damage or expense sustained on
account of damages to Persons or property
occurring by reason of permit work done by
the Permittee, his/her subcontractor or agent,

reserves the right to require complete, certified copies
of all required insurance policies at any time.
Consequently, the Permittee shall be prepared to
provide such copies prior to the issuance of the permit.
(4) If any of the required policies are, or at any
time become, unsatisfactory to the City as to form or
substance, or if a company issuing any such policy is, or
at any time becomes, unsatisfactory to the City, the
Permittee shall promptly obtain a new policy, submit
the same to the City for approval, and thereafter submit
verification of coverage as required by the City. Upon

may have at law or in equity, including those actions
outlined in this Chapter.

otherwise required under this Chapter. The form of the
security and the entity issuing the security shall be
subject to the approval of the City Attorney.

the construction as soon as reasonably

City Liability.
(1) The Permittee agrees to save the City, its
officers, employees and agents harmless from any and
all costs, damages and liabilities which may accrue or
be claimed to accrue by reason of any work performed

agents, any liability or responsibility for damages to any
Person injured by or by reason of the performance of
any work within the Public Way, or under a permit
issued pursuant to this Chapter; nor shall the City, its

public safety and for the protection of Persons and
property), fails either to commence and cause the
required work to be performed with due diligence, or to
indemnify the City for the cost of doing the work, as set

Ordinances, Rules, and Regulations. As
authorized by Utah Code Annotated § 10-7-14,
Tremonton City may enact ordinances, rules, and
regulations for the management and conduct of the
water work system owned and controlled by the City.
14-111. Water Department. The Water
Department of the City is hereby created. It shall
administer the operation and maintenance of the
water system of the City.
(1) Water Meters.
(a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted
by this part, all structures, dwelling units,
establishments and person using water from
the City water system must have such
number of water meters connected to their
water system as are necessary in the
judgment of the Public Works Director or
their designee to adequately measure use
and determine water charges to the
respective users.
(b) Meters will be furnished by the City
upon submission of a completed and signed
Utility Service Agreement application for a
connection, and upon payment of such
connection fees and other costs as contained
in the City’s Consolidated Fee Schedule.
(c) Meters shall be deemed to be and
remain the property of the City. Whenever a
dispute between Public Works Director or
their designee and the property owner arises
as to the appropriate number of meters and
size of meters to be installed on any
premises, the matter shall be heard and
determined by the International Building
Code and the Building Official.
(d) The Public Works Director or their
designee shall cause meter readings to be
taken regularly and shall advise the
Treasurer thereof for the purpose of
recording the necessary billings for water
service.
(e) Meters may be checked, inspected or
adjusted at the discretion of the City, and
they shall not be adjusted or tampered with
by the customer. Meter boxes shall not be
opened for the purpose of turning on or off
the water except by an authorized
representative of the City unless special
permission is given by the Public Works
Director or their designee to the customer to
do so.
(f) If a customer submits a written request
to the Public Works Director or their
designee to test his water meter, the City
may, if under the circumstances it deems it
advisable and in its discretion, order a test of
the meter measuring the water delivered to
such customer. If such request is made
within twelve (12) months after the date of
the last previous test, the customer may be
required to pay the cost of such test. If the
meter is found in such test to record from
ninety-seven percent (97%) to one hundred
three percent (103%) of accuracy under
methods of testing satisfactory to the Public
Works Director or their designee, the meter
shall be deemed to accurately measure the
use of water.
(g) If the City's meters fail to register at any
time, the water delivered during the period
of failure shall be estimated on the basis of
previous consumption during a period which
is not questioned. In the event a meter is
found to be recording less than ninety-seven
percent (97%) or more than one hundred
three percent (103%) of accuracy, the City
shall make such adjustments in the
customer's previous bills as are just and fair
under the circumstances.
(h) All damages or injury to the lines,
meters or other materials of the City on or
near the customer's premises caused by any
act or neglect of the customer shall in the
discretion of the City be repaired by and at
the expense of the customer, and the
customer shall pay all costs and expenses,

be furnished free of charge by the City. Repairs on
fire hydrants within property owned by Tremonton
City shall be at the expense of the City and shall be
made under the direction of the Public Works
Director or their designee. When installed on private
property the installation and repairs on such hydrants
shall be the responsibility of the property owners.
Owners of fire hydrants on property may contact the
Tremonton City Fire Department to have those fire
14-2 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
hydrant routinely inspected, to ensure that fire
hydrants are operational but assumes no
responsibility for property damage associated with
exercising the hydrant.
(3) Moving or Replacement of Water Lines. In
the event that the City in its sole discretion
determines that any water line of the City must be
moved or replaced, the City shall bear that portion of
the cost of such move or replacement which applies
to main lines up to the meter or City owned water
service shut-off valve of the customer. The cost of
reconnecting such new line or lines from the house of
the customer to meter or City owned water service
shut-off valve shall be borne by the customer.

charges for water services and all other rules
necessary for the management and control of the
water system. Rates for services furnished shall be
uniform with respect to each class or classes of
service established or that may hereafter be

14-143. Billing Process.
(1) The City Treasurer or their designee shall
furnish to each person who has signed up for a utility
account, by mail or electronic means a written or
printed statement of the account stating thereon the
amount of water service charges assessed against the
UTILITIES 14-3
customer’s account, once each month or at such other
regular interval as the City Council shall direct.
(2) The statement shall specify the amount of
the bill for the water service and the place of payment
and date due. If any person fails to pay the water
charges within thirty (30) days of the date due, the
City Treasurer or their designee shall give the
customer notice in writing of intent to discontinue the
service to the customer unless the customer pays the
bill in full within five (5) days from the date of
notice.
(3) If the water service is thereafter
discontinued for failure to make payment, as allowed
by Utah Code Annotated § 10-7-10.5 (b), then before
the water service to the premises shall again be
provided, all delinquent water charges must have
been paid to the Treasurer or arrangements made for
their payment in a manner satisfactory to the City.
Furthermore, in addition to such payments and
penalties, a delinquent customer may be required to
provide a new deposit if the previous deposit has
theretofore been applied to the payment of delinquent
bills. The Treasurer is hereby authorized and
empowered to enforce the payment of all delinquent
water charges by an action at law in the name of the
City.
14-144. Discontinuance of Service. Any customer
desiring to discontinue service shall notify the City
before the date when such service shall be
discontinued. On giving such written notice, the
customer shall not be responsible for water bills

credit balance in favor of the customer as a result of
an advance payment of bills or a deposit will be
refunded upon discontinuance of service.
14-145. Board of Equalization on Water Billing.
The Public Works Director, City Manager, and City
Treasurer are hereby constituted a Board of
Equalization of water bills to hear complaints and
may make corrections of any assessments that the
Board deems to be illegal, unequal, or unjust.
Aggrieved individuals may appeal the Board of
Equalization’s decision to the Mayor who shall hear
the complaint de novo (meaning starting from the
beginning; anew). After hearing the complaint the
Mayor shall determine if the water billed was illegal,
unequal, or unjust and shall reduce or rebate the
water bill accordingly. The Mayor is also granted
discretion to consider additional factors in the
complaint on a case by case basis and may pardon an
individual use of water or reduce or rebate their bill.
The Mayor’s decision shall be final.
14-146. Turning on Water after Being Turned off
Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person, after
the water has been turned off from the premises for

the Treasurer, Public Works Director, or designee.
(1) The Public Works Director or City Treasurer
is authorized to issue a financial penalty, as contained
in the City’s Consolidated Fee Schedule, adopted by
Resolution of the City Council for violation of use of
City water without payment. The financial penalty is
not considered to be a criminal punishment, as it is
sought in order to compensate the City for harm done
to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. The
standard for review in issuing civil financial penalties
by the Public Works Director or City Treasurer is
more than fifty percent (50%) likely that the accused
violated the City ordinance. If the individual appeals
financial penalty or refuses to pay the financial
penalty then the Public Works Director or City
Treasurer shall turn the matter over to the Police
Department to investigate the violation and to process
the violation of the City ordinance criminally through
the City’s Justice Court.

system of water supply unless it is done pursuant to
proper application, agreement, or Resolution.
(1) The Public Works Director or City Treasurer
is authorized to issue a financial penalty, as contained
in the City’s Consolidated Fee Schedule, adopted by
Resolution of the City Council for violation of use of
City water without payment. The financial penalty is
not considered to be a criminal punishment, as it is
sought in order to compensate the City for harm done
to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. The
standard for review in issuing civil financial penalties
by the Public Works Director or City Treasurer is
more than fifty percent (50%) likely that the accused
violated the City ordinance. If the individual appeals
financial penalty or refuses to pay the financial
penalty then the Public Works Director or City
Treasurer shall turn the matter over to the Police
Department to investigate the violation and to process
the violation of the City ordinance criminally through
the City’s Justice Court.

for two or more families or service users to be
supplied from the same service pipe, connection or
water meter unless special permission for such
combination usage has been granted by the Public
Works Director and the premises served are owned
by the same owner. In all such cases, a failure on the
part of any one of the users to comply with this
section shall warrant a withholding of a supply of
water through the service connections until
compliance or payment has been made, and in any
event, the property owner shall be primarily liable to
the City for all water services utilized on all such
premises. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
preclude the power of the City to require separate
pipes, connections, or meters at a subsequent time.
14-153. Unauthorized Users. It shall be unlawful,
as contained in the City’s Consolidated Fee Schedule,
adopted by Resolution of the City Council, for any

Mayor’s unavailability, the Mayor Pro Tem, be
necessary, the Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem shall, by a
written Proclamation, limit the use of water to such
extent as may be necessary as allowed by Utah Code
Annotated § 10-7-12. Such Proclamation shall

14-187. Definitions.
(1) “Air gap” means the unobstructed vertical
space between the water outlet and the flood level of
a fixture. A simple example is the space between a
wall mounted faucet and the sink rim (this space is
the air gap). Water can easily flow from the faucet
into the sink, but there is no way that water can flow
from the sink into the faucet without modifying the
system. This arrangement will prevent any
contaminants in the sink from flowing into the
potable water system by siphonage and is the least
expensive form of backflow prevention.
(2) “Approved backflow device/assembly”
me a n s a device/assembly approved by the Public
Works Director or their designee and accepted by
the Utah State Department of Environmental
Quality, Division of Drinking Water, as meeting

These auxiliary waters may include water from
another purveyor’s public drinking water supply or
any natural source(s) such as a well, spring,
river, stream, etc., or “used waters” or “industrial
fluids”. These waters may be contaminated or
polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute
and unacceptable water source over which
Tremonton City does not have authority for sanitary
control.
(4) “Backflow” means the reversal of the
normal flow of water caused by either backpressure
or back-siphonage.
(a) “Back-pressure” means the flow of
water or other liquids, mixtures, or
substances from a region of high pressure
to a region of lower pressure into the water
distribution pipes of a drinking water
supply system from any source(s) other
than the intended source.
(b) “Back-siphonage” means the flow of
water or other liquids, mixtures, or
substances under vacuum conditions into
the distribution pipes of a drinking water
supply system from any source(s) other
than the intended source, caused by the
reduction of pressure in the drinking water
system.
(5) “Backflow prevention device/assembly”
means a device or assembly or means designed to
prevent backflow.
(6) “Contamination or pollution” means a
degradation of the quality of the drinking water
supply by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids,
compounds or other materials that may create a
health hazard.
(7) “Cross connection” means any physical
connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures
which may allow non-drinking water or industrial
fluids or other material of questionable quality to
come into contact with drinking water inside a
drinking water distribution system. This shall
include temporary conditions, such as swing
connections, removable sections, four way plug
valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or
change-over devices or sliding multiport tubes or
other plumbing arrangements.

(1) No water service connection to any
premises shall be installed or maintained by
Tremonton City or customer unless the water supply
is protected as required by State laws, regulations,
codes, and this ordinance with a backflow prevention
device/assembly. A water service connection to a
premise shall be discontinued by Tremonton City if
the conditions or defects below exist. The water
service connection shall not be restored until such
conditions or defects are corrected.
(a) A backflow prevention
device/assembly required by this ordinance
for the control of backflow and cross

14-252. General POTW Use Requirements
(1) Prohibited Discharge Standards. No
industrial user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or
wastewater which causes pass through or
interference. These general prohibitions apply to all
users of the POTW whether or not the source is
subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards or any
other National, State or local Pretreatment Standards
or requirement. Furthermore, no user may contribute
the following substances to the POTW:
(a) Pollutants which create a fire or
explosive hazard in the POTW system,
including, but not limited to waste streams
with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than
140°F (60°C) using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21. At no time
shall two readings on an explosion hazard
meter at the point of discharge into the
POTW, or at any point in the POTW, be
more than five percent (5%) nor any single
reading over ten percent (10%) of the lower
explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.
(b) Any pollutants which will cause, but in
no case discharges with a pH of less than 5.0
or more than 10.0, corrosive structural
damage to the POTW or equipment, or
endangering Tremonton City personnel
unless the POTW is specifically designed to
accommodate such discharges.
(c) Solid or viscous substances in amounts
which will cause obstruction of the flow in
the POTW resulting in interference, but in
no case solids greater than one-half inch
(0.5") or 1.27 centimeter(s) (1.27 cm) in any
dimension.
(d) Any pollutant, including oxygen
demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released
in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which will cause interference
with the POTW.
(e) Any wastewater having a temperature
which will inhibit biological activity in the
treatment plant resulting in interference, but
in no case heat in such quantity that it causes
the temperature at the treatment plant to
14-8 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
exceed 104°F (40°C). This temperature will
be determined by the PWD, based on flow
and location of the facility to the POTW.
(f) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting
oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in
amounts that will cause interference or pass
through.
(g) Pollutants which result in the presence
of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the
POTW in a quantity that may cause acute or
chronic worker health and safety problems.
(h) Any trucked or hauled pollutants,
except at discharge points designated by
Tremonton City in accordance with Section
14-253(5).
(i) Any noxious or malodorous liquids,
gases, solids, or other wastewater which,
either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, are sufficient to create a public
nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(j) Any wastewater which imparts color
which cannot be removed by the treatment
process, such as, but not limited to, dye
wastes and vegetable tanning solutions,
which consequently imparts color to the
treatment plant's effluent thereby violating
Tremonton City's UPDES permit. Color (in
combination with turbidity) shall not cause
the treatment plant effluent to reduce the
depth of the compensation point for
photosynthetic activity by more than ten
percent (10%) percent from the seasonably
established norm for aquatic life.
(k) Any wastewater containing any
radioactive wastes or isotopes except as
specifically approved by the PWD in
compliance with applicable State or Federal
regulations.
(l) Storm water, surface water, ground
water, artisan well water, roof runoff,
subsurface drainage, swimming pool
drainage, condensate, deionized water,
noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted
industrial wastewater, unless specifically
authorized by the PWD.
(m) Any sludges, screening, or other
residues from the pretreatment of industrial
wastes.
(n) Any medical wastes, except as
specifically authorized by the PWD in a
wastewater discharge permit.
(o) Any wastewater causing the treatment
plant effluent to fail a toxicity test.
(p) Any wastes containing detergents,
surface active agents, or other substances
which may cause excessive foaming in the
POTW.
(q) Any discharge of fats, oils, or greases of
animal or vegetable origin is limited to 100
mg/l.
Pollutants prohibited by this section shall not be
processed or stored in such a manner that they could
be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located
in process or materials storage areas must discharge
to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before
connecting with the POTW. If the industrial user
storing the specified pollutant does not have a
pretreatment facility, the floor drain shall be either
plugged with concrete or valved. The valve shall be
locked closed at all times and opened only with
permission from the Tremonton City.
(2) Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The
national categorical Pretreatment Standards found at
40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are
hereby incorporated.
(3) State Pretreatment Requirements. State of
Utah Pretreatment Standards contained in the Utah
Administrative Code R317-8-8 are hereby
incorporated.
(4) Tremonton City Local Limits. The
following pollutant limits, as necessary, shall be
established as a part of the program on an individual
basis, as approved by the State, for each applicant to
protect against pass through and interference. The
established limits may be for some or all of the stated
pollutants and limits for pollutants not listed may also
be included in the local permit.
Composite
Grab Sample Limit Sample Limit
0.63 mg/l arsenic 0.25

0.25 mg/l silver 0.10
300 mg/l total suspended solids 300
3.80 mg/l zinc 1.50
Local limits apply at the point where the indirect
discharge is introduced to the POTW before mixing
with other wastewaters. All concentrations for
metallic substances are for "total" metal unless
UTILITIES 14-9
indicated otherwise. In addition to, or in place of,
concentration based limitations, the PWD may
impose mass limitations.
(5) Tremonton City's Right of Revision.
Tremonton City reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more
stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in Section 14-251(1) or this
ordinance or the general and specific prohibitions in
Section 14-252(1) of this ordinance.
(6) Special Agreement. Tremonton City
reserves the right to enter into special agreements
with industrial users setting out special terms under
which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case
will a special agreement waive compliance with a
Pretreatment Standard or requirement. However, the
industrial user may request a net gross adjustment of
a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15. They may also request, from EPA, a
variance from the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
Such a request will be approved only if the industrial
user can prove that factors relating to its discharge
are fundamentally different from the factors
considered by EPA when establishing that particular
Pretreatment Standard. An industrial user requesting
a variance must comply with the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
(7) Dilution. No industrial user shall increase
the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by
an applicable Pretreatment Standard or requirement.
The PWD may impose mass limitations on industrial
users which are using dilution to meet applicable
Pretreatment Standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
14-253. Pretreatment of Wastewater.
(1) Pretreatment Operations.
(a) Industrial users shall provide
wastewater treatment as needed to comply
with this ordinance, and shall achieve
compliance with all the prohibitions stated
in Section 14-252 within the time limitations
specified by the EPA, the State, or according
to compliance schedules as specified by the
PWD - whichever is more stringent. Any
facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the
industrial user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to
Tremonton City for review, and shall be
acceptable to Tremonton City before
construction of the facility. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in
no way relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an acceptable
discharge to Tremonton City under the
provisions of this ordinance.
(b) The PWD may require industrial users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow
periods, designate certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate municipal waste streams
from industrial waste streams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and secure the industrial
user's compliance with the requirements of
this ordinance.
(c) Each person discharging into the POTW
greater than ten percent (10%) of the
average daily flow in the POTW, shall
install and maintain, on his property and at
his expense, a suitable storage and flow
control facility to insure equalization of flow
over a twenty-four (24) hour period. The
facility shall have a capacity for at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the daily
discharge volume and shall be equipped
with alarms and a rate of discharge
controller, the regulation of which shall be
directed by the PWD. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for
flow equalization.
(d) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall
be provided when, in the opinion of the
PWD, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive
amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except
that such interceptors shall not be required
for residential users. All interceptor units
shall be of type and capacity approved by
the PWD and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected and cleaned
annually or more often, if necessary, and as
needed, by the owner at his expense, and
proof of such inspection and cleaning shall
be provided to the PWD within fifteen (15)
days of completion.
(e) Industrial users with the potential to
discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved
combustible gas detection meter.
(f) At no time shall two readings on an
explosion hazard meter at the point of
14-10 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
discharge into the POTW, or at any point in
the POTW, be more than five percent (5%)
nor any single reading over ten percent
(10%) of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of
the meter.
(2) Slug Load Control Plans. The PWD may
require any industrial user to develop and implement
a slug control plan. At least once every two (2) years
the PWD shall evaluate whether each significant
industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user
required to develop and implement a slug control
plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a
minimum, the following:
(a) Description of discharge practices,
including nonroutine batch discharges.
(b). Type and quantity of stored chemicals.
(c) Procedures for immediately notifying
the POTW of any accidental or slug
discharge. Such notification must also be
given for any discharge which could violate
any of the Prohibited Discharge Standards in
14-252 of this ordinance.
(d) Procedures to prevent adverse impact
from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to:
- Inspection and maintenance of storage
areas,
- Handling and transfer of materials,
loading and unloading operations,
- Control of plant site run-off,
- Worker training,
- Building of containment structures or
equipment,
- Measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or
- Measures and equipment for emergency
response.
(3) Tenant Responsibility. Where an owner of
property leases premises to any other person as a
tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either
the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or
both may be held responsible for compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance.
(4) Hauled Wastewater.
(a) Septic tank waste may be accepted into
the POTW at a designated receiving
structure within the treatment plant area, and
at such times as are established by the PWD,
provided such wastes do not violate 14-252
of this ordinance or any other requirements
established or adopted by Tremonton City.
Wastewater discharge permits for individual
vehicles to use such facilities shall be issued
by the PWD.
(b) The discharge of hauled industrial
wastes as "industrial septage" requires prior
approval and a hauler wastewater discharge
permit from Tremonton City. The PWD
shall have authority to prohibit the disposal
of such wastes, if such disposal would
interfere with the treatment plant operation
or violate 14-252 of this ordinance. Waste
haulers are subject to all other sections of
this ordinance.
(c) Fees for dumping septage will be
established as part of the industrial user fee
system as authorized in 14-265.
(5) Vandalism. No person shall maliciously,
willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of
the POTW. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out
in 14-260 – 14-262, below.
14-254. Wastewater Discharge Permit
Application.
(1) Industrial Waste Survey. When requested
by the PWD any or all industrial users must submit
information on the nature and characteristics of their
wastewater by completing a questionnaire and a
baseline monitoring report prior to commencing
discharge. The PWD is authorized to prepare a
form(s) for this purpose and may periodically require
industrial users to update the survey or baseline
monitoring report. Failure to complete this
application questionnaire shall be reasonable grounds
for IU permit revocation or terminating service to the
industrial user and shall be considered a violation of
the ordinance.
(2) Application Questionnaire Contents. The
PWD shall approve a form to be used as a permit
application. In order to be considered for a
wastewater discharge permit, all industrial users
required to have a wastewater discharge permit must

and concentration (and/or mass, where
required by the standard or by Tremonton
City of regulated pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process. Instantaneous,
daily maximum and long term average
concentration (or mass, where required)
shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations and shall
be sampled and analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in 14-256.
(j) Flow Measurement: Time, duration and
quantity of discharge. In addition, measured
average daily and maximum daily flow, in
gallons per day, to the POTW from each
waste stream, as necessary to allow use of

the compliance date established for the
applicable Pretreatment Standard.
(m) Additional Information: Any other
information as may be deemed necessary by
the PWD to evaluate the wastewater
discharge permit application.
Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be
processed and shall be returned to the industrial user
for revision. Should any of the information requested
or supplied be considered by the industrial user to be
of a confidential nature, the industrial user should
request confidential status in accordance with 14-258
of this ordinance.
(3) Certification. All wastewater discharge
permit applications and permit required industrial
user reports shall contain the following certification
statement and be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user.
"I certify under penalty of law that this document
and all attachments were prepared under my
direction or supervision in accordance with a
system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the

(a) It shall be unlawful for any significant
industrial user to discharge wastewater into
Tremonton City's POTW without first
obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
from the PWD. Any violation of the terms
and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this
ordinance and subjects the wastewater
discharge permittee to the sanctions set out
in Sections 14-260 – 14-262. Obtaining a
wastewater discharge permit does not
relieve a permittee of its obligation to
14-12 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
comply with all Federal and State
Pretreatment Standards or requirements nor
with any other requirements of Federal,
State or local law.
(b) Within either one hundred eighty (180)
days after the effective date of a categorical
Pretreatment Standard, or the final
administrative decision on a categorical
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4),

industrial users subject to such categorical
Pretreatment Standards, and currently
discharging to or scheduled to discharge to
the POTW, shall be required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit.
(c) At least ninety (90) days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new
sources, and sources that become categorical
or significant industrial users subsequent to
the issuance of this ordinance, shall be
required to submit to the Tremonton City an
application for a wastewater discharge
permit. A new source shall also be required
to report the method of pretreatment it
intends to use to meet applicable
Pretreatment Standards. A new source shall
also give estimates of its anticipated flow
and quantity of pollutants discharged.
(d) The PWD may require other industrial
users, including liquid waste haulers, to
obtain wastewater discharge permits as
necessary to carry out the purposes of this
ordinance.
(2) Connections.
(a) Existing: Any significant industrial
user which has an indirect discharge into the

permits may be reassigned or transferred to
a new owner and/or operator only if the
permittee gives at least ninety (90) days
advance notice to the PWD and the PWD
approves the wastewater discharge permit
transfer. The notice to the PWD must
include a written certification by the new
owner and/or operator which:
(i) States that the new owner and/or
operator has no immediate intent to
change facility's operations and
processes
(ii) Identifies the specific date on
which the transfer is to occur
(iii) Acknowledges full responsibility
for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a
transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit
voidable on the date of facility transfer.
(6) Wastewater Discharge Permit Appeals. Any
person, including the industrial user, may petition
Tremonton City to reconsider the terms of a
wastewater discharge permit within ninety (90) days
of its issuance.
(a) Failure to submit a timely petition for
review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the
administrative appeal.
(b) In its petition, the appealing party must
indicate the wastewater discharge permit
provisions objected to, the reasons for this
objection, and the alternative condition, if
any, it seeks to place in the wastewater
discharge permit.
(c) The effectiveness of the wastewater
discharge permit shall not be stayed pending
the appeal.
(d) If Tremonton City fails to act within
ninety (90) days, a request for
reconsideration shall be deemed to be
denied. Decisions not to reconsider a
wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a
wastewater discharge permit, or not to
modify a wastewater discharge permit, shall
be considered final administrative action for
purposes of judicial review.
(e) Aggrieved parties seeking judicial
review of the final administrative
wastewater discharge permit decision must
do so by filing a complaint with the First
Judicial District Court in and for Box Elder
County.
(7) Revocation. Wastewater discharge permits
may be revoked for the following reasons:
(a) Failure to notify Tremonton City of
significant changes to the wastewater prior
to the changed discharge
(b) Failure to provide prior notification to
Tremonton City of changed condition
pursuant to 14-256(5)
(c) Misrepresentation or failure to fully
disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater
discharge permit application
(d) Falsifying self-monitoring reports
(e) Tampering with monitoring equipment
(f) Refusing to allow Tremonton City
timely access to the facility premises and
records
(g) Failure to meet effluent limitations
(h) Failure to pay fines
(i) Failure to pay sewer charges
(j) Failure to meet compliance schedules
(k) Failure to complete a wastewater survey
or the wastewater discharge permit
application
(l) Failure to provide advance notice of the
transfer of a permitted facility
(m) Violation of any Pretreatment Standard
or requirement, or any terms of the
wastewater discharge permit or the
ordinance.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon
non-operation of permitted facility, cessation of
operations, or transfer of business ownership.
14-256. Reporting Requirements.
(1) Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMR).
(a) The PWD may require the submission
of additional, more current BMRs from time
to time from an industrial user. Revised
BMRs should use historical data where the
data provides information sufficient to
determine the need for additional industrial
pretreatment measures.
(b) The BMR shall indicate the time, date,
and location of all sampling provided,
methods of analysis, and shall certify that
the sampling and analysis is representative
of the normal work cycles and expected
pollutant discharges to the POTW.
(c) All baseline monitoring reports must be
UTILITIES 14-15
signed and certified in accordance with 14-
254(3) of this ordinance.
(2) Compliance Schedule Progress Report. The
following conditions shall apply to the compliance
schedule required by the Wastewater Discharge
Permit Application 14-254(2)(l). The schedule shall
contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet
the applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events
include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary
and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing
construction, beginning and conducting routine
operation). No increment referred to above shall
exceed nine (9) months. The industrial user shall
submit a progress report to the PWD no later than
fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule, and the final date of compliance, including,
as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and,
if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial
user to return to the established schedule. In no event
shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the PWD.
(3) Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Compliance Report. Within ninety (90) days
following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in
the case of a new source following commencement of
the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
categorical industrial user subject to such
Pretreatment Standards and requirements shall submit
to Tremonton City a report containing flow
measurement, sampling, and analysis of pollutants
regulated in the industrial users wastewater discharge
permit. For categorical industrial users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c),
this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
categorical industrial user's long term production rate.
For all other industrial users subject to categorical
Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production
(or other measure of operation), this report shall
include the industrial user's actual production during
the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with 14-254(3).
(4) Periodic Compliance Report.
(a) Any significant industrial user subject
to a Pretreatment Standard shall, at a
frequency determined by the PWD but in no
case less than twice per year (in June and
December), submit a report indicating the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by such
Pretreatment Standards, the measured or
estimated average, and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. All periodic
compliance reports must be signed and
certified accordance with 14-254(3).
(b) All wastewater samples must be
representative of the industrial user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. Failure of an
industrial user to keep its monitoring facility
in good working order shall not be grounds
for the industrial user to claim that sample
results are not representative of its
discharge.
(c) If an industrial user, subject to the
reporting requirement in and of this Section,
monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the POTW, using the procedures
prescribed in 14-257(2) of this ordinance,
the monitoring results shall be included in
the report.
(5) Changed Conditions Report. Each industrial
user is required to notify the PWD of any planned
changes to the industrial user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its
wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.
(a) The PWD may require the industrial
user to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a
wastewater discharge permit application
under 14-254.
(b) The PWD may issue a wastewater
discharge permit under 14-254(4) or modify
an existing wastewater discharge permit
under 14-255(4).
(c) No industrial user shall implement the
planned changed condition(s) until and
unless the PWD has approved the industrial
user's change.
(d) For purposes of this requirement, flow
increases of ten percent (10%) or greater,
and the discharge of any previously
unreported pollutants, shall require a
changed condition report.
(6) Slug Discharge Report.
(a) In the case of any discharge including,
but not limited to, accidental discharges,
discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature,
a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug
load which may cause potential problems for
the POTW (including a violation of the
14-16 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
prohibited discharge standards in 14-252(1)
of this ordinance), it is the responsibility of
the industrial user to immediately telephone
and notify the PWD, or his designee of the
incident. This notification shall include the
location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the industrial
user.
(b) Within five (5) days following such
discharge, the industrial user shall, unless
waived by the PWD, submit a detailed
written report describing the cause(s) of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by
the industrial user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the industrial user or any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability which may
be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any
fines, civil penalties, or other liability which
may be imposed by this ordinance.
(c) Failure to notify Tremonton City of
potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this
ordinance.
(d) A notice shall be permanently posted on
the industrial user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom
to call in the event of a discharge described
in paragraph A, above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who may cause or
suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised
of the emergency notification procedure.
(7) Nonpermitted Industrial Users Reports. All
industrial users not subject to categorical
Pretreatment Standards, not classified as SIU, and not
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to Tremonton City
as the PWD may require.
(8) Repeat Sampling Report. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the industrial user must notify the Control Authority
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis within thirty (30) days after
becoming aware of the violation and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority.
The industrial user is not required to resample if the
POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user's at
least once a month, or if the POTW performs
sampling between the industrial user's initial
sampling and when the industrial user receives the
results of this sampling.
(9) Hazardous Waste Discharge Notification.
(a) Any industrial user who commences the
discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director, and the
State Department of Environmental Quality,
Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste
authorities in writing of any discharge into
the POTW of a substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part
261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the industrial user discharges more
than ten (10) kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following
information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the industrial
user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, and
estimation of the mass and concentration of
such constituents in the waste stream
discharged during the calendar month, and
an estimation of the mass of constituents in
the waste stream expected to be discharged
during the following twelve (12) months.
All notifications must take place no later
than thirty (30) days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this
paragraph need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed discharges must be
submitted under Section 14-256(5), above.
The notification requirement in this section
does not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements of
sections 14-256(1), (3), and (4), above.
(b) Dischargers are exempt from the
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section
during a calendar month in which they
discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous
wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such
UTILITIES 14-17
quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulations under
Section 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste
or listing any additional substance as a
hazardous waste, the industrial user must
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Waste Division Director, and
State Department of Environmental Quality,
Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste
authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made
under this section, the industrial user shall
certify that it has a program in place to
reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(10) Timing. Written reports will be deemed to
have been submitted on the date postmarked. For
reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(11) Record Keeping. Industrial users shall
retain, and make available for inspection and
copying, all records and information required to be
retained under this ordinance. These records shall
remain available for a period of at least three (3)
years. This period shall be automatically extended
for the duration of any enforcement action
concerning compliance with this ordinance, or where
the industrial user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the PWD.
14-257. Compliance Monitoring.
(1) Inspection.
(a) Right to Enter: Tremonton City shall
have the right to enter the facilities of any
industrial user at reasonable times to
ascertain whether the purpose of this
ordinance, and any permit or order issued
hereunder, is being met and whether the
industrial user is complying with all
requirements thereof. Industrial users shall
allow the PWD or his representatives ready
access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
Where an industrial user has security
measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the industrial user shall make
necessary arrangements with its security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from Tremonton
City, state, and EPA will be permitted to
enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
(b) Search Warrants: If the PWD has been
refused access to a building, structure or
property or any part thereof, and if the PWD
has demonstrated probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this
ordinance or that there is a need to inspect as
part of a routine inspection program
designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community,
then upon application by the Tremonton
City Attorney, the Justice Court Judge of the
City or the District Court Judge of Box
Elder County shall issue a search and/or
seizure warrant describing therein the
specific location subject to the warrant. The
warrant shall specify what, if anything, may
be searched and/or seized on the property
described. Such warrant shall be served at
reasonable hours by the PWD or Designee, a
Deputy Sheriff or a Tremonton City Police
Officer in the company of a uniformed
police officer of the City. In the event of an
emergency affecting public health and
safety, inspections shall be made without the
issuance of a warrant.
(2) Monitoring.
(a) Sample Collection: Samples for oil and
grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic
chemicals must be obtained using grab
collection techniques. All other wastewater
samples shall be collected using flow
proportional composite sampling
procedures. In the event flow proportional
sampling is infeasible, the PWD may
authorize the use of time proportional
sampling, or a minimum of four (4) grab
samples where the user demonstrates that
this will provide a representative sample of
the effluent being discharged. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge
limits.
(b) Monitoring Equipment: Tremonton
City, State, and EPA shall have the right to
set up on the industrial user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are
14-18 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
necessary to conduct sampling and/or
metering of the user's operations.
Tremonton City may require the industrial
user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the industrial user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated semi-annually to ensure their
accuracy.
(c) Analytical Requirements: All pollutant
analyses, including sampling techniques, to
be submitted as part of a wastewater
discharge permit application or for any of
the reports required in 14-256 shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA.
(d) Determination of Noncompliance: The
PWD may use a grab sample(s) to determine
noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards.
The decision to use this method is at the
discretion of the PWD and would not be
announced in advance to the industrial user.
(3) Obstructions and Delays.
(a) Any temporary or permanent
obstruction to safe and easy access to the
industrial facility to be inspected and/or
sampled shall be promptly removed by the
industrial user at the written or verbal
request of the PWD and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be born by the industrial user.
(b) Delays in allowing Tremonton City
personnel access to the industrial user's
premises shall be a violation of this
ordinance.
14-258. Confidential Information. Information
and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from Tremonton City inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public
without restriction unless the industrial user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of Tremonton City that the release of
such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable State law.
When requested and demonstrated by the industrial
user furnishing a report that such information should
be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall
not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall immediately be made available, upon
request, to governmental agencies for uses related to
the UPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by
40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential
information and will be available to the public
without restriction. Tremonton City will provide a
secure facility to maintain documentation considered
confidential.
14-259. Annual Publication.
(1) Requirement to Publish. Tremonton City
shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is
located, a list of the industrial users which, during the
previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment
Standards and requirements.
(2) Significant Noncompliance. The term
significant noncompliance shall mean:
(a) Chronic Violations: Chronic violations
of wastewater discharge limits, defined here
as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or
more of wastewater measurements taken
during a six (6) month period exceed the
daily maximum limit or average limit for the
same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(b) TRC Violations: Technical Review
Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or
more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6)
month period equals or exceeds the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average
limit multiplied by the applicable criteria
[1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and
1.2 for all other pollutants except pH];
(c) Discharge Violations: Any other
discharge violation that Tremonton City
believes has caused, alone or in combination
with other discharges, interference or pass
through (including endangering the health of
Tremonton City personnel or the general
public);
(d) Endangerment: Any discharge of
pollutants that has caused imminent
UTILITIES 14-19
endangerment to the public or to the
environment, or has resulted in Tremonton
City's exercise of its emergency authority to
halt or prevent such a discharge;
(e) Failure to Comply: Failure to meet,
within ninety (90) days of the scheduled
date, a compliance schedule milestone
contained in a wastewater discharge permit
or enforcement order for starting
construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
(f) Failure to Report: Failure to provide
within thirty (30) days after the due date,
any required reports, including baseline
monitoring reports, ninety (90) day
compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
(g) Failure to accurately report
noncompliance;
(h) Other Violations: Any other
violation(s) which Tremonton City
determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
14-260. Administrative Enforcement Remedies.
(1) Notification of Violation. Whenever the
PWD finds that any user has violated or is violating
this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement, the PWD or his agent may serve upon
said user a written Notice of Violation. Such written
notice shall be served in person or by certified mail
where a receipt is obtained. Within thirty (30) days of
the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the PWD.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of Tremonton City to
take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a
Notice of Violation.
(2) Consent Orders. The PWD is hereby
empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible
for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific
action to be taken by the order. Consent Orders shall
have the same force and effect as administrative
orders issued pursuant to 14-260(4) and (5) below
and shall be judicially enforceable.
(3) Show Cause Hearing. The PWD may order
any user which causes or contributes to violation(s)
of this ordinance, wastewater discharge permits, or
orders issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or requirement, to appear before the PWD
and show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting,
the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why
this proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Such written notice shall be served in person
or by certified mail where a receipt is obtained. The
notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. Whether or not the user
appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action
may be pursued following the hearing date. A show
cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking
any other actions against the user.
(4) Compliance Orders. When the PWD finds
that a user has violated or continues to violate the
ordinance, wastewater discharge permits, or orders
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or requirement, he may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user
come into compliance within thirty (30) days. If the
user does not come into compliance within thirty (30)
days, sewer service may be discontinued.
Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring, and
management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a Federal Pretreatment
Standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
release the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking
any other action against the user.
(5) Cease and Desist Orders. When the PWD
finds that a user is violating this ordinance, the user's
wastewater discharge permit, any order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the PWD may issue an order to the
user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
(a) Immediately comply with all
requirements
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or
preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations
14-20 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the
user.
(6) Administrative Fines.
(a) Notwithstanding any other section of
this ordinance, any user found to have
violated any provision of this ordinance, its
wastewater discharge permit, and orders
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or requirement may be required to
reimburse the City for any penalties the City
incurs as a result of the violation and fined
an amount as contained in the City’s
Consolidated Fee and/or Bail Schedule,
adopted by Resolution of the City Council
per day per violation for an individual,
corporation, partnership, or any other entity
user. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for
each day during the period of violation.
Tremonton City may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement
actions such as notices and orders to the
fine.
(b) Assessments may be added to the user's
next scheduled sewer service charge and the
PWD shall have such other collection
remedies as may be available for other
service charges and fees.
(c) Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties
shall, after sixty (60) calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of ten percent
(10%) percent of the unpaid balance and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of
one percent (1%) per month. A lien against
the individual user's property will be sought
for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(d) Users desiring to dispute such fines
must file a written request for the PWD to
reconsider the fine along with full payment
of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of
being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the PWD shall convene a hearing
on the matter within fourteen (14) days of
receiving the request from the industrial
user. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment together with any
interest accruing thereto shall be returned to
the industrial user.
(e) Issuance of an administrative fine shall
not be a prerequisite for taking any other
action against the user.
(7) Emergency Suspensions. The PWD may
immediately suspend a user's discharge (after
informal notice to the user) whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of any people.
The PWD may also suspend a user's discharge permit
(after notice and opportunity to respond) that
threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge
permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the PWD shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, contamination of
sludge, or endangerment to any individuals. The
PWD shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of Tremonton City that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings set forth in 14-260(8) are initiated
against the user.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall
submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the PWD,
prior to the date of any show cause or termination of
discharge hearing under 14-260(3) and (8).
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this section.
(8) Termination of Discharge. In concert with
the wastewater discharge permit revocation
provisions in Section 14-255(7) of this ordinance,
any user that violates any of the following conditions
of this ordinance, wastewater discharge permits, or
orders issued hereunder, is subject to discharge
termination.
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge
permit conditions;
(b) Failure to accurately report the
wastewater constituents and characteristics
of its discharge;
(c) Failure to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater volume,
constituents and characteristics prior to
discharge;
UTILITIES 14-21
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the
user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(e) Violation of the standards in 14-252 of
this ordinance.
The Industrial user will be notified of the proposed
termination of its discharge permit and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under 14-260(3) of this
ordinance why the proposed action should not be
taken.
14-261. Judicial Enforcement Remedies.
(1) Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has
violated a Pretreatment Standard or requirement or
continues to violate the provisions of this ordinance,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the
PWD may petition the First Judicial District Court in
and for Box Elder County, State of Utah, through
Tremonton City’s attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities
of the industrial user. In addition, Tremonton City
may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
and other expenses of litigation by appropriate legal
action against the user found to have violated any
provision herein, or any other rules, regulations,
permits, or agreements issued herein. Such other
action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief
may also be sought by Tremonton City. A petition
for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite
to taking any other action against a user.
(2) Civil Fine Pass Through Recovery. In the
event that an industrial user discharges such
pollutants which cause Tremonton City to violate any
conditions of its UPDES Permit and Tremonton City
is fined by EPA or the State of Utah for such
violations, then such industrial users shall be fully
liable for the total amount of the fines and civil
penalties assessed against the Tremonton City by
EPA or the State of Utah and administrative costs
incurred.
(3) Referral to State of Utah for Action.
Tremonton City will refer to the State of Utah
criminal violations of any Pretreatment Standards or
permit conditions. The Attorney General's office for
Utah will offer the city wherein the violation
occurred the option to prosecute the violator. Should
the local entity decline, the State, at its discretion,
may initiate appropriate criminal action. Tremonton
City will assist the Attorney General's office any way
it can with appropriate support for the action taken.
(4) Nonexclusive Remedies. The provisions in
Sections 14-259 – 14-262 are not exclusive remedies.
Tremonton City reserves the right to take any, all, or
any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with
Tremonton City's enforcement response plan.
However, Tremonton City reserves the right to take
other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, Tremonton City is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user. These actions may be taken
concurrently.
14-262. Supplemental Enforcement Action.
(1) Performance Bonds (Optional). The PWD
may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit
to any user which has failed to comply with the
provisions of this ordinance, any orders, or a previous
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to
Tremonton City in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the PWD to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
(2) Liability Insurance (Optional). The PWD
may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit
to any user which has failed to comply with the
provisions of this ordinance, any order, or a previous
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless
the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
(3) Water Supply Severance (Optional).
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate
the provisions of this ordinance, orders, or
wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, water
service to the user may be severed. Service will only
recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(4) Public Nuisances (Optional). Any violation
of this ordinance, wastewater discharge permits, or
orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public
nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the PWD or his designee, and/or as allowed by
this Part 14-250, or other applicable law. Any
person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject
to the provisions of the City and state Code relating
to the abatement of nuisances, including reimbursing
the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating
or remedying said nuisance.
(5) Contractor Listing (Optional). Users which
have not achieved consistent compliance with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and requirements
are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the
sale of goods or services to Tremonton City.
Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to
Tremonton City held by a user found to be in
14-22 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
significant noncompliance with Pretreatment
Standards may be terminated at the discretion of
Tremonton City.
14-263. Affirmative Defenses.
(1) Upset.
(a) For the purposes of this section, upset
means an exceptional incident in which
there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the
industrial user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or
careless or improper operation.
(b) An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of paragraph (3) are met.
(c) An industrial user who wishes to
establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
(i) An upset occurred and the
industrial user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;
(ii) The facility was at the time being
operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with
applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
(iii) The industrial user has submitted
the following information to the POTW
and treatment plant operator within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the upset [if this information is
provided orally, a written submission
must be provided within five (5) days]:
(A) A description of the indirect
discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
(B) The period of noncompliance,
including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated
time the noncompliance is expected
to continue.
(C) Steps being taken and/or
planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the
noncompliance.
(d) In any enforcement proceeding, the
industrial user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden
of proof.
(e) Industrial users will have the
opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset in an enforcement action
brought for noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards.
(f) The industrial user shall control
production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation
where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is
reduced, lost or has failed.
(2) General/Specific Prohibitions. An industrial
user shall have an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific
prohibitions in 14-252(1) of this ordinance if it can
prove that it did not know or have reason to know
that its discharge, along or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass
through or interference and that either: (a) a local
limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
industrial user was in compliance with each limit
directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference, or (b) no local limit exists, but the prior
discharge when Tremonton City was regularly in
compliance with its UPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable
sludge use or disposal requirements.
(3) Bypass.
(a) (i) "Bypass" means the intentional
diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment
facility.
(ii) "Severe property damage" means
substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities
which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass.
Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in
production.
(b) An industrial user may allow any
bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or requirements to
be violated, but only if it also is for essential
UTILITIES 14-23
maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the
provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this
section.
(c) (i) If an industrial user knows in
advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the POTW,
at least ten (10) days before the date of
the bypass if possible.
(ii) An industrial user shall submit oral
notice of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable Pretreatment
Standards to the POTW within twentyfour
(24) hours from the time it
becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be
provided within five (5) days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware
of the bypasses. The written
submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration
of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and the steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The POTW may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within twentyfour
(24) hours.
(d) (i) Bypass is prohibited, and the
POTW may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass,
unless;
(A) Bypass was unavoidable to
prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
(B) There were no feasible
alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during
normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up
equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to
prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
(C) The industrial user submitted
notices as required under paragraph
(c) of this section.
(e) The POTW may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects,
if the POTW determines that it will meet the
three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(i) of
this section.
14-264. User Fees. User fees should be assessed
whenever there is a need to recover the cost of
treating wastewater. These fee calculations may be
found in Addendum A of this ordinance, on another
adopted fee schedule of the City, or in an Agreement
between the City and the user to which the fee
applies.
14-265. Miscellaneous Provisions.
(1) Pretreatment Fees. If applicable, Tremonton
City may adopt reasonable charges and fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating a
Tremonton City Pretreatment Program as contained

(d) Fees for filing appeals.
(e) Other fees as Tremonton City may
deem necessary to carry out the

ordinance and are separate from all other
fees, fines and penalties chargeable by
Tremonton City.
(2) Severability. If any provision of this
ordinance is invalidated by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be
effected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(3) Conflicts. All other ordinances and parts of
other ordinances inconsistent or conflicting with any
part of this ordinance, are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency or conflict.

Power and the current addition of the National
Electrical Safety Code pertaining to such
construction. Further, City attachments shall be
attached or installed only after written approval by
Rocky Mountain Power.
(7) Rocky Mountain Power shall have the right
to excavate the Public Ways subject to reasonable
conditions and requirements of the City. Before
installing new underground conduits or replacing
existing underground conduits, Rocky Mountain
Power shall first notify the City of such work and
shall allow the City, at its own expense, to share the
trench of Rocky Mountain Power to lay its own
conduit therein, provided that such action by the City
will not unreasonably interfere with Rocky Mountain
Power’s Electric Facilities or delay project
completion.
(8) Before commencing any street
improvements or other work within a Public Way
that may affect Rocky Mountain Power’s Electric
Facilities, the City shall give written notice to Rocky
Mountain Power.
18-129. Relocations of Electric Facilities.
(1) The City reserves the right to require Rocky
Mountain Power to relocate its Electric Facilities
within the Public Ways in the interest of public
convenience, necessity, health, safety or welfare at no
cost to the City. Within a reasonable period of time
after written notice, Rocky Mountain Power shall
promptly commence the relocation of its Electrical
Facilities. Before requiring a relocation of Electric
Facilities, the City shall, with the assistance and
FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS 18-3
consent of Rocky Mountain Power, identify a
reasonable alignment for the relocated Electric
Facilities within the Public Ways of the City. The
City shall assign or otherwise transfer to Rocky
Mountain Power all right it may have to recover the
cost for the relocation work and shall support the
efforts of Rocky Mountain Power to obtain
reimbursement.
(2) Rocky Mountain Power shall not be
obligated to pay the cost of any relocation that is
required or made a condition of a private
development. If the removal or relocation of
facilities is caused directly or otherwise by an
identifiable development of property in the area, or is
made for the convenience of a customer, Rocky
Mountain Power may charge the expense of removal
or relocation to the developer or customer. For
example, Rocky Mountain Power shall not be
required to pay relocation costs in connection with a
road widening or realignment where the road project
is made a condition or caused by a private
development.
18-130. Subdivision Plat Notification. Before the
City approves any new subdivision and before
recordation of the plat, the City shall mail notification
of such approval and a copy of the plat to Rocky

Rocky Mountain Power
Attn: Property Management / Right-of-Way
Department
825 NE Multnomah, Suite 1700
Portland, Oregon 97232
18-131. Vegetation Management. Rocky Mountain
Power or its contractor may prune all trees and
vegetation which overhang the Public Ways, whether
such trees or vegetation originate within or outside
the Public Ways to prevent the branches or limbs or
other part of such trees or vegetation from interfering
with Rocky Mountain Power’s Electrical Facilities.
Such pruning shall comply with the American
National Standard for Tree Care Operation (ANSI
A300) and be conducted under the direction of an
arborist certified with the International Society of
Arboriculture. A growth inhibitor treatment may be
used for trees and vegetation species that are fastgrowing
and problematic. Nothing contained in this
Section shall prevent Rocky Mountain Power, when
necessary and with the approval of the owner of the
property on which they may be located, from cutting
down and removing any trees which overhang streets.
18-132. Renewal. At least one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the expiration of this Franchise,
Rocky Mountain Power and the City shall agree to
either extend the term of this Franchise for a mutually
acceptable period of time or the parties shall use best
faith efforts to renegotiate a replacement Franchise.
Rocky Mountain Power shall have the continued
right to use the Public Ways of the City as set forth
herein in the event an extension or replacement
Franchise is not entered into upon expiration of this
Franchise.
18-133. No Waiver. Neither the City nor Rocky
Mountain Power shall be excused from complying
with any of the terms and conditions of this Franchise
by any failure of the other, or any of its officers,
employees, or agents, upon any one or more
occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with
any such terms and conditions.
18-134. Transfer of Franchise. Rocky Mountain
Power shall not transfer or assign any rights under
this Franchise to another entity, except transfers and
assignments by operation of law, unless the City shall
first give its approval in writing, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
inclusion of this Franchise as property subject to the
lien of Rocky Mountain Power’s mortgage(s) shall
not constitute a transfer or assignment.
18-135. Amendment. At any time during the term
of this Franchise, the City through its City Council,
or Rocky Mountain Power may propose amendments
to this Franchise by giving thirty (30) days written
notice to the other of the proposed amendment(s)
desired, and both parties thereafter, through their
designated representatives, will, within a reasonable
time, negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree
upon mutually satisfactory amendment(s). No
amendment or amendments to this Franchise shall be
effective until mutually agreed upon by the City and
Rocky Mountain Power and formally adopted as an
ordinance amendment.
18-136. Notices. Unless otherwise specified herein,
all notices from Rocky Mountain Power to the City
pursuant to or concerning this Franchise shall be
delivered to the City Recorder's Office. Unless
otherwise specified herein, all notices from the City
to Rocky Mountain Power pursuant to or concerning
this Franchise shall be delivered to the Customer
Services Vice President, Rocky Mountain Power, 201
South Main, Suite 2400, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111,
and such other office as Rocky Mountain Power may
advise the City of by written notice.
18-137. Severability. If any section, sentence,
paragraph, term or provision hereof is for any reason
determined to be illegal, invalid, or superseded by
other lawful authority including any state or federal
regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof or
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid by any court of

limits, including any property annexed or otherwise

supplying natural gas service in accordance with this
Franchise.
18-222. Consideration. In consideration of this

$50.00 upon acceptance of this Franchise and shall
provide gas service in accordance with the terms of
this Franchise.
18-223. Term. This Franchise is granted for a
fifteen (15) year term from the Effective Date. Upon
the date of expiration of this Franchise Agreement,

the terms of renewal. The terms and conditions of
this Franchise Agreement will remain in effect until
the new Franchise Agreement between the City and
Questar Gas become effective.
18-224. Acceptance. Within sixty (60) days after
the passage of this ordinance, Questar Gas shall file

18-226. Construction and Maintenance of
Facilities.
(1) All Facilities shall be constructed and
installed so as to interfere as little as possible with
traffic over and public use of the Streets and to cause
minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of
the Streets. All Facilities shall be constructed in
accordance with established gas distribution
construction practices and in a manner which protects
the Facilities from all traffic loads. Without
unreasonable additional cost to Questar Gas, all
Facilities that are installed during the term of the
Franchise shall be sited to be visually unobtrusive
and to preserve the natural beauty and neighborhood
aesthetics within the City limits.
(2) Questar Gas shall repair or replace, at its
own expense, any and all rights of way, pavements,
sidewalks, street improvements, excavations, other
facilities, landscaping, or other improvements, public
or private (hereafter referred to collectively as
“Public or Private Improvements”), that it damages in
the Franchise operations.
18-227. Compliance with Ordinances--Conflict.
(1) Questar Gas shall comply with all City
ordinances, regulations, and requirements and shall
pay all applicable excavation fees and charges that
are or may be prescribed by the City with respect to
the construction, maintenance and operation of all
Facilities. However, these obligations shall apply
only as long as such ordinances, regulations,
requirements, or fees are not preempted by or
otherwise in conflict with any applicable statutory or
constitutional law, rule, or regulation, or the tariffs
approved by regulatory bodies having jurisdiction
over Questar Gas, including this Franchise and any
lawful revisions made and accepted by Questar Gas
during the term of the Franchise.
(2) The City shall have the right to inspect the
construction and maintenance of the Facilities and
Questar Gas’s repair to Public or Private
Improvements to ensure the proper compliance with
applicable City ordinances, regulations, requirements
and compliance with this Franchise. In the event
Questar Gas should fail to comply with the terms of
any City ordinance, regulation, requirement, or this
Franchise the City shall give Questar Gas written
notice of such non-compliance and the time for
correction provided by ordinance or this Franchise or
a reasonable time for correction if there is no time
FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS 18-5
frame provided by the applicable ordinance,
regulation, or requirement. Excluding any correction,
modification, or change to the Facilities, and after
written notice and failure of Questar Gas to make
correction, the City may, at its sole risk, make such
correction itself and charge the cost to Questar Gas
including any minimum cost provided by ordinance.
The City shall not make, nor request or allow any
party other than Questar Gas to make changes,
corrections, or modifications of any kind to Questar
Gas’s Facilities. Nothing in this Franchise limits
Questar Gas’s right to oppose any ordinance, whether
existing, proposed, or adopted, from and after the
effective date of this Franchise.
18-228. Information Exchange. Upon request by
either the City or Questar Gas, as reasonably
necessary, Questar Gas and the City shall meet for
the purpose of exchanging information and
documents regarding construction and other similar
work within the City limits or its declared annexation
areas, with a view towards coordinating their
respective activities in those areas where such
coordination may prove mutually beneficial. Any
information received by the City from Questar Gas
that contains or relates to Questar Gas’s confidential
or proprietary information, including but not limited
to information regarding future capital improvements
that may involve land acquisition shall be treated
with confidentiality upon Questar Gas’s written
request identifying what specific information is
confidential or proprietary and to the extent that the
City may lawfully do so.
18-229. Relocation.
(1) Upon written notice to Questar Gas, the City
may require the relocation and removal or
reinstallation (hereafter referred to collectively as,
“Relocation”) of any Facilities located in, on, along,
over, across, through, or under any of the Streets.
After receipt of such written notice, Questar Gas shall
diligently begin such Relocation of its Facilities as
may be reasonably necessary to meet the City’s
requirements. The Relocation of Facilities by
Questar Gas shall be at no cost to the City if (i) such
request is for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare pursuant to lawful authority
delegated to the City; (ii) the Facilities have been
installed pursuant to this or any other Questar Gas
franchise and not pursuant to a property or other
similar right, including, but not limited to, a right-ofway,
grant, permit, or license from a state, federal,
municipal or private entity; and (iii) the City provides
a new location for the Facilities. Otherwise, a
Relocation required by the City pursuant to such
written notice shall be at the City’s expense.
Following Relocation of any Facilities, Questar Gas
may maintain and operate such Facilities in a new
location within City limits without additional
payment. If a City project is funded by federal or
state monies that include an amount allocated to
defray the expenses of Relocation of Facilities, then
the City shall compensate Questar Gas up to the
extent of such amount for any Relocation costs
allowed by the project to the extent that the City
actually receives or is otherwise authorized to direct
or approve payment of such federal or state funds;
however, the City shall ensure that receipt of
compensation from federal or state sources shall not
restrict or otherwise obligate Questar Gas’s
ownership of the Facilities in any way.
(2) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph,
Questar Gas shall not be responsible for any costs
associated with an authorized City project that are not
attributable to Questar Gas’s Facilities in the Streets.
Further, all such costs shall be allocated among all
utilities or other persons whose facilities or property
are subject to Relocation due to an authorized City
project.
18-230. Terms of Service. Questar Gas shall
furnish natural gas service without preference or
discrimination among customers of the same service
class at reasonable rates, in accordance with all
applicable tariffs approved by and on file with
regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over Questar
Gas, including revisions to such tariffs made during
the term of the Franchise, and in conformity with all
applicable constitutional and statutory requirements.
Questar Gas may make and enforce reasonable rules
and regulations in the conduct of its business, may
require its customers to execute a gas service
agreement as a condition to receiving service, and
shall have the right to contract with its customers
regarding the installation and operation of its
Facilities. To secure safe and reliable service to the
customers, and in the public interest, Questar Gas
shall have the right to prescribe the sizes and kinds of
pipes and related Facilities to be used and shall have
the right to refuse service to any customer who
refuses to comply with Questar Gas’s rules and
regulations.
18-231. Indemnification. Questar Gas shall
indemnify, defend, and hold the City, its officers and
employees, harmless from and against any and all
claims, demands, liens, liabilities, damages, actions,
and proceedings arising from the exercise by Questar
Gas of its rights under this Franchise, including its
operations within City limits, and Questar Gas shall
pay the reasonable cost of defense plus the City’s
reasonable attorney fees. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary, Questar Gas shall not be
obligated to indemnify, defend or hold the City
harmless to the extent that any underlying claim,
demand, lien, liability, damage, action, and
18-6 TREMONTON CITY REVISED ORDINANCES
proceeding arises out of or in connection with any act
or omission of the City or any of its agents, officers
or employees.
18-232. Assignment. Questar Gas may assign or
transfer its rights and obligations under the Franchise
to any parent, affiliate, or subsidiary of Questar Gas,
to any entity having fifty percent (50%) or more
direct or indirect common ownership with Questar
Gas, or to any successor-in-interest or transferee of
Questar Gas having all necessary approvals,
including those from the Utah Public Service
Commission or its successor, to provide utility
service within the City limits. Questar Gas shall
provide the City with written notification of its
assignment or transfer of its rights and obligations
under this Franchise. Otherwise, Questar Gas shall
not transfer, assign, or delegate any of its rights or
obligations under the Franchise to another entity
without the City’s prior written approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. Inclusion of the Franchise
as an asset of Questar Gas subject to the liens and
mortgages of Questar Gas shall not constitute a
transfer or assignment requiring the City’s prior
written consent.
18-233. Insurance. Questar Gas shall responsibly
self-insure or maintain insurance to cover its
obligations and liabilities as set forth in Section 10, in
lieu of any insurance as may be required in any City
ordinances.

Questar Gas to post a surety bond, that section of the
ordinance is expressly waived.
18-235. Effect of Invalidity. If any portion of this
Franchise is for any reason held illegal, invalid, or

1.05.050 Rights of Property Owner Not Affected.

1.05.005 PURPOSE.

Pursuant to Utah Code Annotated (“UCA”) 63L-4-201, the purpose of this Chapter is to provide advisory guidelines for Land Use Authorities and to assist the City in identifying actions involving a physical taking and/or regulatory taking, collectively referred to as Constitutional Takings. Additionally, this Chapter establishes a procedure for review of actions that may have Constitutional Taking issues pursuant to UCA 63L-4-301.

1.05.010 CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING GUIDELINES. 

A. Use of Guidelines. In accordance with UCA 63L-4-201(2), the following guidelines shall be considered by a Land Use Authority for process and when administering  in Title I, II, or III, and when the City is taking any action that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private real property. The City may, or the property owner may, request a review of the guidelines to determine and identify whether a proposed governmental action raises Constitutional Taking issues.

B. Limitations of Guidelines. As stated in UCA 63L-4-201 (3), the guidelines adopted and decisions rendered pursuant to the provisions of the Chapter are advisory, and shall not be construed to expand or limit the scope of the City’s liability for an unconstitutional taking of a vested property interest. The decision rendered pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter is not admissible in court for any purpose other than to demonstrate that the review has been completed, and, pursuant to Utah Rule of Evidence 408, in no event shall any recommended compensation be admissible into evidence.

C. Property Ombudsman’s Assistance.  As stated in UCA 13-43-203 (b), the Office of the Property Rights Ombudsman is to assist state agencies and local governments in developing the guidelines required by Title 63L, Chapter 4, Constitutional Taking Issues. The guidelines contained in this Section are provided by the Office of the Property Rights Ombudsman in an effort to provide better understanding of constitutional private property protections and the land use regulation process. The guidelines below are not meant to constitute legal advice. They simplify and broadly generalize complex issues of law.

1. Taking.  Taking is where private property is so used or restricted that compensation is due to the property owner, but no compensation or inadequate compensation is offered. Generally, a taking occurs when one property owner, or a relatively few property owners, are forced to bear a significant burden so that the public in general, or a relatively large number of property owners, can receive a benefit.

2. Basic Elements of a Taking.  The basic elements of a taking include:

a. An Action, (but not a negligent, emergency or other exempt action);
b. To Occupy, Damage, or Interfere With;
c. Protected Private Property;
d. By a Government Entity or Private Entity Acting Under Government Authority;
e. For a Public Purpose; and
f. Without the Payment of Just Compensation.

3. Physical Takings.

a. Physical Occupation of the Property.  A physical occupation of property by the government or someone acting with government authority such as a utility or a contractor working for the government is always a taking if the occupation is permanent and advances a public purpose.

1. An example of physical occupation of property includes placing a cable box on the outside of an apartment building. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).

2. An example of a physical occupation of property includes allowing waters to occupy private property repeatedly or permanently. Colman v. Utah State Land Board, 795 P.2d 622 (1990), Pigs Gun Club v. Sanpete County 2002 UT 17.

3. An example of a physical occupation of property includes requiring the landowner to endure continual trespass or public access on private lands. Dolan v. Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).

b. Physical “Damaging” by Government-Created Nuisance. When some government activity or action rises to the level of an actionable nuisance, which usually involves some government activity on public property, that is near to or adjoins the land that is claimed to suffer an unconstitutional burden. The issue in such cases is whether the government activity is so unreasonable as to constitute an actionable interference with the quiet enjoyment of property.

1. An example of physical damaging by government-created nuisance includes airport corridors – noise and vibration. Katsos v. Salt Lake City Corp. 624 F. Supp. 100 (U.S. Dist. Ct. Utah, 1986).

2. An example of physical damaging by government-created nuisance includes nuisances in general. See Logan City School District v. Croft, 13 Utah 2d 310, 373 P.2d 697 (1962). (Schoolyard noises not a factor in damages in eminent domain action.)

c. Physical Interference with a Protected Property Right. When a physical action interferes with one of the specific aspects of property ownership that has been listed as separately protected.

1. An example of physical interference with a protected property right includes right to air, light and view across a street, such as building an overpass in the street in front of residential lots. Utah State Road Comm. v. Miya. 526 P.2d 926 (1974).

2. An example of physical interference with a protected property right includes loss of functionality due to changes in curb cuts on a city street. Three D. Corp. v. Salt Lake City. 752 P.2d 1321 (UT Ct. App. 1988) Carpet Barn v. State of Utah 795 P.2d 1138 (UT Ct. App. 1990)

3. An example of physical interference with a protected property right includes right to reasonable access. Hampton v. State ex rel. Road Commission, 21 Utah 2d 342, 445 P.2d 708 (1968).

d. Regulations that Interfere with a Vested Right. Once a property owner has established the right to a particular use of land, the government may not revoke that right.

1. An example of regulations that interfere with a vested right includes nonconforming uses, which were legal when the regulations were passed, but would be illegal under existing law, also have protected status as vested rights if not abandoned or amortized under the terms of an amortization ordinance. See U.C.A. 10-9-103. Cases considering the establishment and continuation of nonconforming uses include Rock Manor Trust v. State Rd. Comm’n 550 P.2d 205 (Utah 1976) (nonconforming use survives destruction of the building by fire), Caster v. West Valley City, 2001 UT App 220 (nonconforming use not abandoned if any of several alternative activities defined as part of that use are continued) and Hugoe Trucking v. Woods Cross, 1999 UT App 281 (since use was established before an Ordinance, it has vested and may continue).

4. Regulatory Takings:

a.  Regulations Which Impose Disproportionate Burdens. An action may be unconstitutional if it is deemed unfair in an analysis of three factors: (1) the burden placed on the property owner, (2) the nature of the government action and benefit, and (3) the property owner’s investment-backed expectations.

1. An example of regulations which impose disproportionate burdens include denial of right to build office tower over historic landmark not a taking, when weighing all factors involved in an ad hoc inquiry. Penn Central Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978).

2. An example of regulations which impose a disproportionate burden include where there was no deprivation of all economic value in wetlands case, the Court remanded for a takings analysis based on the “Penn Central Balancing Test”. See concurring opinion by Justice O’Conner regarding the Penn Central balancing test in Palazzolo v. State of Rhode Island 121 S. Ct. 2448 (2001). A thirty-two month development moratorium was not held to be a taking because, after balancing all factors involved, the delay involved was not unreasonable. The burden of this particular moratorium must be weighed in light of the significant community value represented by the purity of the waters of Lake Tahoe. Preservation of the quality of the lake would eventually enhance both property values and the public good. Adequate time must be taken to carefully plan for community development, even if a complete denial of all use is imposed for a finite and reasonable period. Tahoe Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Authority. 122 S. Ct. 1465, (2002).

b.   Regulations that Interfere with a Protected Property Right. When an ordinance or statute or other government action results in an unreasonable interference with a protected aspect of property ownership.

1. An example of regulations that interfere with a protected property right include right to pass property on to heirs. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 (1987).

1.12.005 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the State of Utah has delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Tremonton, Utah, does ordain as follows:

1.12.010 FINDINGS OF FACT.

A. The Flood Hazard areas of Tremonton City are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for Flood Protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. These flood losses may be created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in Floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they may be inadequately elevated, Floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.

1.12.015 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, fiber, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in Floodplains;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of Flood-Prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and

G. Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

1.12.020 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.

A. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Ordinance uses the following methods:

1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;

2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against   flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;

4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may increase flood damage;

5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

1.12.025 DEFINITIONS.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this Ordinance it’s most reasonable application.

ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform, which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

APEX means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one (1) percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD is the land in the floodplain within the City subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.

BASE FLOOD means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

BASEMENT means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

CRITICAL FEATURE means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

DEVELOPMENT means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

ELEVATED BUILDING means a non-basement building:

A. Built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and

B. Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, “elevated building” also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters.  In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, “elevated building” also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of “elevated building,” even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

EXISTING CONSTRUCTION means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the FIRM (September 29, 2010) or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. “Existing construction” may also be referred to as “existing structures.”

EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the City.

EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

FLOOD OR FLOODING means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

A. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.

B. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM) means an official map of the City, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY is the official report provided by the Federal Emergence Management Agency.  The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary Floodway Map.

FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding).

FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS means zoning Ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose Ordinances (such as a floodplain Ordinance, grading Ordinance and erosion control Ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such State or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a “special flood hazard” and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

FLOOD PROOFING means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

HARDSHIP (Use Variance) When used in the context of Section 1.12.035 D zoning variances of these regulations, unusual physical circumstances peculiar to the subject property and not to the neighborhood in general which would result in a deprivation of all permitted uses or conditional uses under its zoning to which it can reasonably be put, and therefore all reasonable economic return from the property if zoning is strictly enforced. That which causes the hardship must:

A. Be exceptional and undue;

B. Relate to an extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of the property; and

C. Not result from any affirmative action of the property owner (be “self-inflicted”). Since all zoning imposes some degree of hardship, “mere” hardship does not justify a variance.

HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

HISTORIC STRUCTURE  means any structure that is:

A. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

B. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

C. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or

D.  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:

1. By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or;

2. Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

LEVEE means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water to provide protection from temporary flooding.

LEVEE SYSTEM  means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.

LOWEST FLOOR  means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood insurance Program regulations.

MANUFACTURED HOME  means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”.

MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

MEAN SEA LEVEL  means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

NEW CONSTRUCTION  means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM (September 29, 2010) or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the City.

RECREATIONAL VEHICLE  means a vehicle which is:

A. Built on a single chassis;

B. Four Hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;

C. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

D. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use

START OF CONSTRUCTION (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred-eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

STRUCTURE  means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or

B.  Any alteration of a “historic” structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

VARIANCE is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this Ordinance when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A Variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)

VIOLATION means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b) (5), (c) (4), (c) (10), (d) (3), (e) (2), (e) (4), or (e) (5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

WATER SURFACE ELEVATION means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

1.12.030 GENERAL PROVISIONS.

A. Lands to which this Chapter Applies. This Chapter shall apply to all “areas of special flood hazard” within the jurisdiction of Tremonton City.

B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The “areas of special flood hazard” identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, Exhibit A “The Flood Insurance Study for Tremonton City” dated September 29, 2010, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) Exhibit B, and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance.

C. Establishment of Development Permit. A Development/Building Permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

D. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations.

E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Ordinance and another Ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

F. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Ordinance, all provisions shall be:

1. Considered as minimum requirements;

2. Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and

3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State Statutes.

G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and may occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

1.12.035 ADMINISTRATION.

A. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is hereby appointed the Floodplain Administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this Chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.

B. Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance.

2. Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes will be reasonably safe from flooding.

3. Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this Chapter.

4. Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or Local Governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.

5. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.

6. Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the Utah State Coordinating Agency, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

7. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.

8. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 1.12.030 B, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Section 1.12.040.

C. Permit Procedures. Application for a Development/Building Permit shall be presented to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Approval or denial of a Development/Building Permit by the Floodplain Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this Chapter. Additionally, the following information is required:

1. Elevation (in relation to Mean Sea Level), of the Lowest Floor (including basement) of all new and   substantially improved structures;

2. Elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which any nonresidential structure shall be Floodproofed;

3. A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential Floodproofed structure shall meet the Floodproofing criteria of Section 1.12.040 B 2;

4. Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and

5. Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Section 1.12.035 B 1.

D. Variance Procedures.

1. The process as established by the City shall hear and render judgment on requests for Variances from the requirements of this Ordinance.

2. The variance process shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter.

3. Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision through the Variance process may appeal such decision in the District Court of competent jurisdiction.

4. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving a Variance and shall report Variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

5. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.

6. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section C 2 of 1.12.035 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

7. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Appeal Authority may attach such conditions to the granting of Variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance Section 1.12.015.

8. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

9. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

10. Prerequisites for granting variances:

a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the Variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

b. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. showing a good and sufficient cause;

2. a determination that failure to grant the Variance would result in exceptional Hardship to the applicant, (see definition of Hardship) and

3. a determination that the granting of a Variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or Ordinances.

c. Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the Lowest Floor Elevation below the Base Flood Elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

11. Variances may be issued by the City for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:

a. The criteria outlined in Section 1.12.035 D 1- 9 are met, and

b. The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

1.12.040 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.

 A. General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:

1. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

2. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

3. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;

4. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

5. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;

6. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,

7. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

B. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where Base Flood Elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 1.12.030 B, Section 1.12.035 B 8, or Section 1.12.040 C 3, the following provisions are required:

1. Residential Construction – new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. A registered Professional Engineer, Architect, or Land Surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 1.12.035 C 3. is satisfied.

2. Nonresidential Construction – new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one (1) foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to Mean Sea Level) to which such structures are Floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.

3. Manufactured Homes – Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.

A. To promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City.

2.01.020 PENALTY FOR VIOLATING TITLE. All punishments, fines, and/or fees for violating this Title shall be in accordance with Title I, Chapter 1.01 General Provisions, Section 1.01.040 Penalty for Violating Title.

2.01.025 LAND USE AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ORDINANCE. All Land Use Authorities shall issue no permit or license for subdivision where the same would be in conflict with the provisions of this Title and any such permit or license, if issued in conflict with the provisions of this Title, shall be null and void.

2.01.030 BURDEN OF PROOF. The burden demonstrating compliance with this Title rests with the Developer or Property owner.

2.01.035 LEGAL REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION. In accordance with UCA 10-9a-802, the Tremonton City Council or any owner of real estate within the zoning district in which an alleged violation of this Title has occurred in addition, may institute injunction, mandamus, abatement, or any other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, or subdivision.

2.01.040 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITY. The Zoning Administrator is hereby designated and authorized as the officer charged with the enforcement of this Title.

2.01.045 REASONABLE CONDITIONS IMPOSED. This Title is designed to inform the subdivision developer and the public of the requirements for obtaining subdivision plat approval. To this end, an attempt has been made to outline all subdivision requirements in this Title and other applicable Ordinances and laws. Because each parcel of real property is unique and has its own set of problems to be dealt with, and because there may be some aspects of subdivision development that cannot be easily articulated, it is not possible to cover every possible contingency. Therefore, the Planning Commission and/or the Land Use Authority Board have the authority to impose reasonable conditions upon a subdivider in addition to those expressly required, provided that:

A. The conditions are not arbitrary or capricious;

B. The Planning Commission and/or the Land Use Authority Board find that the conditions are necessary to promote the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of Tremonton;

C. The conditions do not conflict with any applicable law; or

D. The conditions imposed are in compliance with Utah Code 10-9a-508 as amended by the Utah Legislature.

2.01.050 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THIS TITLE. Proposed amendments to this Title shall be processed according to Chapter 1.32 of Title I.

2.01.055 CONFLICTING STANDARDS. This Title shall not nullify more restrictive laws or more restrictive provisions set forth in covenants, agreements or deed restrictions governing the subdivided property, but shall prevail over such laws or provisions that are less restrictive. This provision shall not be interpreted to imply that the City shall enforce restrictive covenants to which it is not a party.

2.01.060 SEVERABILITY. Should any portion of this Title be found to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining portions not found to be invalid or unconstitutional shall remain in full force and effect.

2.01.065 UNLAWFUL SUBDIVISIONS.

A. Any division of real property located within the City shall be subject to the terms of this Title unless specifically exempt by this Title.(See Section 2.01.075) The division of real property includes any sale, gift, transfer, conveyance, split or other division that results in changing the boundaries or legal description of a given parcel of real property.

1. Illegal Transfer. It is unlawful to transfer, sell, convey, gift or assign any subdivided property before a final subdivision plat for the property to be transferred, sold, conveyed, gifted or assigned is approved and recorded pursuant to the requirements of this Title and applicable State law.

2. Lot Standards and Access. Except as otherwise provided, all lots/parcels created by the subdivision of real property shall comply with the City’s lot size, lot width, and buildable area requirements, and shall abut on a dedicated street or private drive connected to a dedicated street.

3. Compliance of Illegal Subdivision. Any developer desiring to develop property that has been subdivided illegally shall comply with the requirements of this Title before developing the property, regardless of whether or not the developer was the one who illegally subdivided the property. No Building Permit may be issued for a lot that has been illegally subdivided.

4. Recorded Plat Amendments. It is unlawful to amend, vacate, alter or modify any plat, which has already been approved and/or recorded, without first receiving City approval of the amended, vacated, altered or modified plat.

5. Protection Strips and Undevelopable Lots. It is unlawful to divide real property in such a way that a parcel of property is created or left behind that cannot be developed according to the requirements of this Title, the City Zoning Ordinance Title I, or other applicable laws, regardless of whether or not a subdivision plat is required for the division. Examples of this type of violation include, but are not limited to, nuisance or protection strips, parcels created or left for the sole purpose of denying another property owner access to his or her property, parcels with insufficient square footage, parcels with insufficient buildable area, parcels that do not meet the requirements of this Title, or the City Zoning Ordinance Title I, and parcels that do not abut on a dedicated street.

2.01.070 COMPLIANCE WITH APPROVAL AND STANDARDS. All property shall be developed in strict compliance with the approved Preliminary Plat, the approved Final Plat, the approved Construction Drawings, Title III General Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications and all notes, restrictions, covenants, development agreements, dedications, boundaries, and other commitments shown on the approved Preliminary and/or Final Plat. Failure on an approved plan to note any improvement required by this Title on the Preliminary Plat, Final Plat or the construction drawings shall not eliminate the developer’s responsibility to complete the improvements in the subdivision.

2.01.075 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES. It shall be unlawful for a subdivision that has the effect of rendering any existing structure nonconforming to current City Ordinances, and shall not be allowed. All property lines, streets and other improvements shall be located in such a way as not to render any existing use or structure nonconforming. However, the Land Use Authority Board may grant an exception to this requirement if, due to substantial difficulty with the topography of the property, a street cannot reasonably and practically be located in such a way that avoids creating a nonconforming structure.

2.01.080 EXEMPT SUBDIVISIONS. Exempt Subdivisions do not exempt development of the lot or parcel created from compliance with this or any other Title, Ordinance, Policy or Procedure that the City has established. No subdivision approval shall be required for:

It is the responsibility of the Developer to secure all required off-site easements.

C. Only the City and utility agencies, which have a valid, current franchise agreement with the City, may locate facilities within a public utility easement. To promote the orderly installation and maintenance of utilities, the City shall have the right to determine the location within the public utility easement where a public utility agency may locate its facilities.

D. The City Engineer may waive or modify the requirement for a public utility easement under this section if the easement has not been recorded and the City Engineer determines that the public utility easement is not needed for existing or future utilities.

2.06.090 DITCHES, CANALS AND NATURAL WATERWAYS.

A. Anytime a ditch, whether irrigation, drainage or a canal is piped, the developer shall obtain from the person or entity operating the ditch or canal and the City Engineer, approval regarding the design, construction size and type of pipes, cleanout boxes, diversion boxes, grates etc. to be used. The irrigation system shall then be constructed and installed in accordance with the approved design. If the ditch or canal is required to be abandoned, the developer shall obtain from the person or entity operating the ditch or canal a letter stating that they concur in the abandonment of the ditch.

In accordance with Utah Code Annotated (“UCA”) 10-9a-508, subdivisions that require water service shall provide to the City, in addition to those requirements associated with culinary water, the necessary water shares in the Bear River Canal Company and shall construct a secondary water transmission and distribution system sufficient to satisfy the existing and future uses of the occupants to be supplied by the City’s Secondary Water System in the proposed development.

A. The installment of the secondary water transmission and distribution system shall be done in accordance with the construction standards contained Chapter 3.19 of Title III.

B. The developer shall also provide water shares sufficient to meet the municipal needs that will be created by the development. For each irrigable acre of residential development, one (1) water share from the Bear River Canal Company shall be dedicated to the City. For single family detached housing subdivisions the City has determined that the required water shares to be dedicated to the City based upon lot sizes, in the table below, is roughly proportionate to the impacts of a residential development. The exact number of water shares from the Bear River Canal Company to be dedicated to the City for each irrigable acre of developed Industrial, Commercial, Institutional, and Multi-Family Dwelling is to be calculated by the Public Works Director or City Engineer after a site-specific analysis is performed of the irrigable acreage of the development. Said dedication of water shares shall occur prior to the approval or contingent upon the approval and for subdivisions of property and prior to the recording of the subdivision with the Box Elder County Recorder.
