Sections:

2.35.010    Authority and purpose.

2.35.030    Records index.

2.35.040    Employee responsibility.

2.35.050    Categories of requests and standard response time.

2.35.060    Reimbursement for copying costs.

2.35.070    Exemptions.


2.35.010 Authority and purpose.

A. The Washington State Public Records Act (Act), Chapter 42.56 RCW, requires the city of Shoreline (city) to make available for inspection and copying public records in accordance with the city’s published rules. The Act defines “public record” as any “writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained” regardless of physical form or characteristics.

B. The city manager is authorized to establish a Public Records Act policy to adopt reasonable rules, consistent with the intent of the Act and the Model Rules in Chapter 44-14 WAC, that provide the public full access to public records with “fullest assistance” to requestors and the “most timely possible action on requests,” while protecting public records from damage and disorganization, preventing excessive interference with other essential functions of the city, and withholding certain public records from disclosure subject to various legal exemptions. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 435 § 1, 2006; Ord. 47 § 1, 1995]


2.35.020 Scope of rules authorized.

As required by the Act, the city has separately established a Public Records Act policy (policy) establishing reasonable rules for requesting public records and responding to requests for public records. The policy will contain:

A. An agency description, the designation of a public records officer (officer), the officer’s contact information, the hours and location for inspection of public records and the officer’s responsibilities under the Public Records Act.

B. The procedure for making, responding to, inspecting and copying records requests; protecting records from damage or disorganization; preventing excess interference with Shoreline’s other essential functions; protecting the rights of others; providing “fullest assistance” to requestors and the “most timely possible action on requests.”

C. The policy is posted on the city’s website at www.shorelinewa.gov/pdr. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 47 § 2, 1995]


2.35.030 Records index.

A. The Act requires the city to maintain and make available a current index of certain public records. However, the Act also provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, or would interfere with government operation, a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

B. All substantive and procedural rules of general applicability, including but not limited to ordinances and resolutions of the city council, minutes of the regular meetings of the city council, and statements of general policy, and all public contracts, deeds, easements and leases shall be indexed and maintained in the city clerk’s office for the use of the city and of the general public. The following indices are also available on the city of Shoreline website, on the city clerk’s page:

1. Final opinions.

2. City policies.

3. Planning policies and goals and interim and final planning decisions.

4. Staff reports and city council minutes from 2000 to present.

The indices for the following are not published as to do so would be unduly burdensome:

1. Factual staff studies, factual consultant reports and studies, scientific reports and studies and other factual information derived from tests, studies, reports or surveys.

2. Correspondence, and materials referred to therein, by and with the agency relating to any regulatory, supervisory, or enforcement responsibilities of the agency, whereby the agency determines, or opines upon, or is asked to determine or opine upon, the rights of the state, the public, a subdivision of the state government, or of any private party.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4)(a) the records in this subsection B are not maintained because the city has eight departments and each department produces its own factual and scientific reports and studies and their own consultants’ reports and studies. Each department also manages its own regulatory/supervisory/enforcement correspondence. Creating an index of reports and studies and of regulatory/supervisory/enforcement correspondence and maintaining the indices would take an inordinate amount of agency time, interfering with agency day-to-day operations. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 435 § 2, 2006; Ord. 47 § 3, 1995]


2.35.040 Employee responsibility.

A. All city employees are responsible for assisting in identifying responsive records and facilitating thorough collection of records. 

B. The city will comply with the training requirements in the Open Government Training Act, RCW 42.56.150 and 42.56.152. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 435 § 2, 2006; Ord. 49 § 1, 1995; Ord. 47 § 4, 1995]


2.35.050 Categories of requests and standard response time.

A. When the city receives a public record request it will be categorized according to its scope, the volume of public records being requested, the effort necessary to conduct an adequate search, and the need for redacting exempt information.

B. The city must make public records available promptly when requested under the Act. If records cannot be made available within five business days, the Act requires a written response to the requestor. The city may acknowledge receipt and provide a reasonable estimate of the time necessary to make the record available. The policy shall establish estimates for standard response periods for each records request category. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016]


2.35.060 Reimbursement for copying costs.

A. A requestor may obtain paper copies or electronic scans of public records under RCW 42.56.120; the city will charge for these according to the public records fee schedule adopted in SMC 3.01.220. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 435 § 5, 2006; Ord. 47 § 7, 1995. Formerly 2.35.070]


2.35.070 Exemptions.

A. The Act provides that a number of documents and information are exempt from public inspection and copying. These exemptions are found in RCW 42.56.210 through 42.56.480. In addition to exemptions found in Chapter 42.56 RCW, other statutes outside of the Act may prohibit disclosure of specific information or records. [Ord. 742 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 435 § 3, 2006; Ord. 47 § 5, 1995. Formerly 2.35.050]

The determination as to whether to furnish a defense as provided under this chapter to a member or members of the city council shall be made without the vote of such member or members of the city council unless the inclusion of such member or members is required for a quorum; provided, that if a claim or lawsuit affects a quorum or greater number of the members of the city council, all such affected members shall retain their voting privileges under this section. [Ord. 37 § 4, 1995]


2.40.050 Representation and payment of claims – Conditions.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply only when the following conditions are met:

A. In the event of any incident or course of conduct potentially giving rise to a claim for damage, or the commencement of a suit, the official or employee involved shall, as soon as practicable, give the city manager written notice thereof, identifying the official or employee involved, all information known to the official or employee with respect to the date, time, place and circumstances surrounding the incident or conduct giving rise to the claim or lawsuit, as well as the names and addresses of all persons allegedly injured or otherwise damaged thereby, and the names and addresses of all witnesses.

In the event that any official or employee fails or refuses to comply with any of the conditions of SMC 2.40.040, or elects to provide their own representation with respect to any such claim or litigation, then all of the provisions for indemnification in this chapter shall be inapplicable, and have no force or effect with respect to any such claim or litigation. [Ord. 37 § 7, 1995]

A. If the city determines that an official or employee does not come within the provisions of this chapter, and a court of competent jurisdiction later determines that such claim does come within the provisions of this chapter, then the city shall pay any judgment rendered against the official or employee and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in defending against the claim. The city shall pay any costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is covered by the provisions of this chapter; provided if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such claim does not come within the provisions of this chapter, then the official or employee shall pay the city’s costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is not covered under the provisions of this chapter.

When fewer than three quotes are requested or if there are fewer than three responses, an explanation shall be placed in the procurement file.

2. Whenever possible, quotes shall be solicited on a lump sum or fixed unit price basis.

3. At the time quotes are solicited, the city representative shall not inform a vendor of any other vendor’s quote.

4. A written record shall be made by the city representative of each vendor’s quote and of any conditions imposed on the quote by such vendor.

5. All of the quotes shall be collected and presented at the same time to the director or designee as appropriate for consideration, determination of the lowest responsible vendor and award of purchase.

6. Whenever there is a reason to believe that the lowest acceptable quote is not the best price obtainable, all quotes may be rejected and the city may obtain new quotes or enter into direct negotiations to achieve the best possible price. In this case, the director or designee shall document, in writing, the basis upon which the determination was made for the award.

D. Formal Competitive Bid.

1. General. Unless otherwise specifically approved by the city council, all contracts relating to the purchase of materials, equipment, or supplies where the cost is greater than $50,000 shall be by sealed bid.

2. Invitation for Bids. An invitation for bids shall be issued which shall include the specifications and the contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement.

3. Public Notice. Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city, not less than 13 calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids, unless for good cause shown the city council authorizes a different period of time. The public notice shall state the date and time of bid opening. Bids not received by the date and time stated for bid opening shall not be accepted or considered.

4. Bid Opening. Bids shall be opened publicly and recorded at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids.

5. Withdrawal of Bids. Bids may be modified or the bid may be withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for opening. Notice may be delivered personally, by U.S. Mail, by a recognized overnight courier service, or by electronic mail (email). After bid opening, withdrawal of bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence presented in a sworn affidavit or declaration submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. on the first business day after bid opening, that a clerical mistake in the bid was made and not a mistake in judgment, and the bid price actually intended was different than what was submitted. All decisions to permit the withdrawal of bids after bid opening based on bid mistakes, shall be made by the director or designee.

6. Award. For purchases equal to or less than $100,000, the bids shall be submitted to the city manager for authorization. For purchases greater than $100,000, the bids shall be submitted to the city council, along with staff recommendation on selection of lowest responsible vendor. The award of bid shall be made to the lowest responsible bidder whose bid meets the specifications and evaluation criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. The city may reject all bids at its discretion.

E. Lowest Responsible Vendor. The following factors, in addition to price, may be taken into account by the city in determining the lowest responsible vendor:

1. Any preferences provided by law to local products and vendors;

2. Such other information as may be secured indicating a reasonable probability that the vendor shall not be able to perform the contract according to its terms and specifications.

F. Life Cycle Costing. In considering the purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment, whenever there is a reason to believe that applying the “life cycle costing” method of quote evaluation would result in the lowest total cost to the city, first consideration shall be given to purchases with the lowest life cycle cost which complies with the specifications.

G. Recycled Products. The city shall seek to maximize purchase of products using recycled materials and products suitable for recycling, unless the purchase will result in an unreasonable increase in price or degradation of quality or performance over comparable products. [Ord. 890 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 620 § 1, 2011; Ord. 335 § 3, 2003; Ord. 302 §§ 4, 5, 2002; Ord. 272 § 1, 2001]


2.60.060 Public works projects.

A. Purchasing Procedures. Public works contracts shall follow bid requirements applicable to code cities with a population in excess of 20,000, as set forth in RCW 35.23.352. Cost for a public works project includes all amounts paid for materials, supplies, equipment, and labor on the construction of that project which is inclusive of sales tax, unless exempted by law.

B. Purchasing Limitations. The city manager may authorize the purchase and execution of public works projects equal to or less than the dollar threshold for small works projects as set forth in RCW 39.04.155 as amended.

C. Competitive Bids. “Craft” means a recognized construction trade or occupation for which minimum wage categories are established by the Department of Labor and Industries of the state of Washington in the locality of the city’s projects.

1. Projects for single craft or multiple crafts with a reasonably anticipated price equal to or less than the dollar thresholds as set forth in RCW 35.23.352, as amended, do not require the use of competitive quotes or bids. Departments are allowed to make these purchases administratively in accordance with procedures developed by the director. All purchases require a purchase order or an executed contract.

2. Projects for single craft or multiple crafts with a reasonably anticipated price higher than the dollar thresholds as set forth in RCW 35.23.352, as amended, up to the maximum dollar threshold as set forth in RCW 39.04.155, as amended, shall either use the small works roster or a formal competitive bid procurement process. All purchases require a purchase order or an executed contract.

3. Projects with a cost in excess of the maximum dollar threshold as set forth in RCW 39.04.155, as amended, require a formal competitive bid process. The city council shall authorize these purchases and provide authority for the city manager to execute the related contract.

D. Small Works Roster. There is established for the city of Shoreline a small works roster contract award process for accomplishment of public works projects with an estimated value threshold as set forth in RCW 39.04.155, as amended. The city may create a single small works roster, or may create small works rosters for different categories of anticipated work.

1. Roster List. The small works roster(s) shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the list, and where required by law, are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in the state of Washington. In addition to mandatory criteria for determining a responsible contractor under RCW 39.04.350, other criteria listed in SMC 2.60.050(E) may be added.

2. Publication. At least once a year, the city shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the city the notice of the existence of the roster(s) and solicit the names of contractors for such roster(s). Responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster(s) at any time that they submit a written request and necessary records.

3. Master Contract. The city may require a master contract to be signed that becomes effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster.

4. Appeal. Any contractor whose request to be on the roster(s) has been denied may appeal within 10 calendar days after the denial to the city manager; the city manager will make a decision within 30 calendar days of the notice of appeal. A denial by the city manager may be appealed to the city council within 10 calendar days of the date of the decision. The city council shall hold a public hearing on the issue and make a decision within 45 calendar days of receipt of the notice of appeal. A denial that is not appealed, or that is appealed and results in a final decision against the contractor, prevents the contractor from applying to be on the roster(s) for a period of one year from the date of the initial request.

5. Process. Whenever work that has received city council approval in the current budget, or otherwise been approved by the city council, is sought to be accomplished using a small works roster, a city representative shall obtain telephone, written or electronic quotations from contractors on the appropriate small works roster to assure that a competitive price is established and to award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder as follows:

a. A contract awarded from a small works roster need not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes.

b. Quotations may be invited from:

i. All appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster, by sending notice to these contractors; or

ii. At least five contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate small works roster. For purposes of this section, “equitably distribute” means that the city may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services.

c. At the time quotations are solicited, the city representative shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor’s bid for the same project.

d. A written record shall be made by the city representative of each contractor’s bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bids obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available upon request.

e. At least once every year, a list of the contracts awarded under this process is to be furnished to the city council and made available to the general public. The list shall contain the name of the contractor or vendor awarded the contract, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed or items purchased under the contract, and the date it was awarded. The list shall also state the location where the bids for these contracts are available for public inspection.

6. Determining Lowest Responsible Bidder. The city shall award the contract for a small works project to the lowest responsible bidder; provided, that whenever there is a reason to believe that the lowest acceptable bid is not the best price obtainable, all bids may be rejected and the city may call for new bids.

7. Cancellation of Invitations for Quotations. Each invitation for quotations issued by the city shall state that the invitation may be canceled at the discretion of the director or designee. The reason(s) for cancellation shall be made part of the contract file. Notice of cancellation shall be sent to all parties that have been provided with a copy of the invitation and state briefly the reasons for cancellation.

E. Limited Public Works. The city may use the limited public works process to award public works projects as authorized by RCW 39.04.155, as amended.

F. Formal Competitive Bid. 

1. For public works not using a small works roster, the formal competitive bid process of SMC 2.60.050(D)(2) through (6) shall be used; provided, the city manager may award contracts of less than the dollar threshold for small works as set forth in RCW 39.04.155.

2. All contracts with an estimated cost greater than $1,000,000 shall require that no less than 15 percent of the labor hours performed by workers subject to prevailing wages employed by the contractor or its subcontractors be performed by apprentices enrolled in an apprenticeship training program approved or recognized by the Washington State Apprenticeship and Training Council. Contractor prevailing wage documentation shall be supplemented to monitor compliance with this requirement throughout the contract.

a. The public works director may waive the requirements for apprentices in bid documents or reduce the apprenticeship hours during the contract if:

i. The apprenticeship requirement conflicts with state or federal funding conditions, or the conditions of any other grant or funding program;

ii. An insufficient number of apprentices are available to meet the contract requirements; or

iii. The project involves a high proportion of equipment and materials costs compared to the anticipated labor hours.

b. The public works director may reduce the apprenticeship hours throughout the duration of the contract if:

i. The contractor has demonstrated that it has utilized its “best efforts” to meet the established percentage requirement, but remains unable to fulfill the goal; or

ii. In order to meet the requirement, the contractor will be forced to displace members of its workforce.

c. A contractor or subcontractor failing to comply with apprenticeship requirements of this subsection shall not be considered a responsible bidder on city public works projects for a period of two consecutive years from the date of the city’s final acceptance of the project in which noncompliance occurred. 

G. Alternative Public Works Contracting. As an alternative to bidding for public works projects as provided in this chapter, under certain circumstances the city may use alternative public works contracting procedures to award projects as authorized by Chapter 39.10 RCW, as amended. The city shall not utilize these procedures unless doing so best serves the public interest.

H. Bid Deposit and Performance Bond for Public Works Projects.

1. Whenever competitive bids are required, a bidder shall make a deposit in the form of a certified check or bid bond of the percentage specified in the call for bids; however, this amount shall not be less than five percent of the total bid. As part of any bid submitted, the bidder shall be required to warrant that the bid is a genuine bid, and that they have not entered into collusion with any other bidder or any other person.

2. All public works contractors shall furnish a performance bond in an amount equal to the total amount of the contract on a form approved by the city attorney. In lieu of a performance bond on contracts less than the dollar threshold set forth in RCW 39.08.010, as amended, a contractor may request to have the city accept the percentage allowed by RCW 39.08.010 of the contract retained for a period of 30 calendar days after the date of the city’s final acceptance of the project or until receipt of all necessary releases from the Department of Revenue and the Department of Labor and Industries and settlement of any liens filed under Chapter 60.28 RCW, whichever is later. As authorized by RCW 39.08.030, the city may, at its option, reduce the amount of a performance bond to not less than 25 percent of the total contract amount for on-call, unit priced, or scheduled maintenance contracts. [Ord. 890 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 620 § 1, 2011; Ord. 588 § 1, 2010; Ord. 561 § 1, 2009; Ord. 335 §§ 4 – 9, 2003; Ord. 302 § 6, 2002; Ord. 272 § 1, 2001]


2.60.070 Services.

A. Purchasing Limitations. Purchase limitations apply to the cost related to the acquisition of services to fill a specific business need. Cost is inclusive of any required sales tax and related expenses.

1. Contracts equal to or less than $100,000 may be executed by the city manager.

2. Contracts greater than $100,000 shall be authorized by the city council.

3. The initial contract procurement process should apply a realistic and complete scope of services and length of time that would be necessary to complete a project unless intermediate stages have documented independent utility, or there is a need for immediate action on a project using a limited scope and council authorization on the full project is processed without delay.

B. Contract or Purchase Order Required. The purchase of services require that the city enter into a contract or purchase order for that service, with the exception of temporary employment agency services, and services with a total cost of $10,000 or less in a calendar year. Departments are allowed to make these purchases administratively in accordance with procedures developed by the director.

C. On-Call Service Contracts. On-call service contracts shall be procured with the process identified in subsection D of this section. Individual task orders of on-call service contracts shall not exceed $100,000.

D. Process.

1. Architectural, Landscape Architectural, and Engineering Services. Procedures set forth in Chapter 39.80 RCW shall be followed for contracts for architectural and engineering services, as defined in RCW 39.80.020.

a. Services Roster(s). Annually the city shall publish in advance the anticipated city’s requirements for architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering services and its acceptance of statements of qualifications for contractors interested in providing these services. The services roster(s) shall be comprised of responsible contractors who have submitted statements. Responsible contractors shall be added to the services roster(s) at any time that they submit a written request to the city accompanied by a statement of necessity. 

b. Contracts Equal to or Less Than $100,000. Contracts that have an estimated cost of equal to or less than $100,000 can be procured using an informal request for qualification process. This process requires the city representative to develop a written scope of the project and select a qualified contractor from the city’s architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering services roster(s). If the city representative does not choose to use the appropriate roster, then the formal request for qualification process set forth in subsection (D)(1)(c) of this section shall be followed.

c. Contracts Greater Than $100,000. Contracts that have an estimated cost greater than $100,000 must use a formal request for qualification (RFQ) process. The development of an RFQ along with the proper public notification shall be made in accordance with procedures developed by the director; provided, the city manager may waive the RFQ process and allow the acquisition of services rosters as provided in subsection (D)(3) of this section, Waiver of Process.

2. All Other Professional and Nonprofessional Services.

a. Contracts Equal to or Less Than $100,000. Contracts that have an estimated cost of equal to or less than $100,000 can be procured using an informal request for proposal process. This process requires the city representative to develop a written scope of the project. Multiple proposals are optional and at the discretion of the department director. If multiple proposals are used to make a selection, a standard process must be used for obtaining all proposals.

b. Contracts Greater Than $100,000. Contracts that have an estimated cost in excess of $100,000 shall be procured using a formal request for proposal (RFP) process. The development of an RFP along with the proper public notification shall be made in accordance with administrative procedures developed by the director; provided, the city manager may waive the RFP process as provided in subsection (D)(3) of this section, Waiver of Process.

3. Waiver of Process. For all types of services, when a contract has an estimated cost greater than $100,000, the city manager may waive the RFQ process in the following circumstances:

a. Quantifiable costs of delay in using an RFP process are likely to outweigh higher quality performance expected from the RFP process;

b. It can be demonstrated that there are insufficient contractors on the services roster that possess the required qualifications to perform the scope of work or, for non-services roster contracts, that specialized expertise, experience, or skill is needed for a successful outcome and outweighs potentially lower price proposals; or

c. A contractor has previously provided satisfactory service to the city related to the specific project and has the qualifications to perform the scope of work.

E. Interlocal Joint Purchasing Agreements. Services may be purchased as authorized by RCW 39.34.030 using joint purchasing agreements with a city, county, state, or other public agency. Such joint purchasing agreements shall be approved by the city council prior to utilization. [Ord. 890 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 620 § 1, 2011; Ord. 446 § 3, 2007; Ord. 302 §§ 7, 8, 9, 2002; Ord. 272 § 1, 2001]


2.60.080 Interlocal joint purchasing agreements.

Repealed by Ord. 890. [Ord. 335 § 10, 2003; Ord. 272 § 1, 2001]


2.60.090 Real property acquisition.

A. Real Property – Acquisition Authority. The city manager is authorized to accept by gift or acquire dedications, easements, rights-of-way, fee estates or other interests in real property for use by or on behalf of the city or any department of the city by threat of eminent domain, if necessary, in the following instances:

1. Minor Acquisitions. Any acquisition where the purchase price is equal to or less than $10,000.

2. Approved Projects. Any acquisition which is part of an approved and funded project included in the city’s capital improvement plan or a local improvement district ordered by the city council and the cost of the property is not greater than $50,000 or other amount specifically authorized for a particular project, subject to the following:

a. Acquisitions in excess of $25,000 shall be appraised and city manager approval may not exceed 10 percent of the fair market value of the property as determined by the city’s appraiser or review appraiser.

b. For projects in the city’s capital improvement plan, the city manager is authorized to convey city council’s intent that these projects shall be accomplished with the use of eminent domain if necessary.

3. Relocation Claims. Where real property acquisition requires relocation, reimbursement of relocation costs is not included in the authorization limits of subsection (A)(2) of this section. The city manager is authorized to approve properly documented claims up to the limits prescribed by federal or state law regardless of amount, provided the city council has approved a project relocation plan for the project which includes any good faith parcel relocation cost estimate that exceeds $50,000 or such higher parcel relocation limit approved by city council for a particular project. 

4. All other real property acquisitions shall be submitted to the city council for approval.

B. Real Property – Manager’s Leasing Authority.

1. The city manager or designee is authorized to execute leases of real property on behalf of the city where the term of the lease does not exceed one year and the consideration does not exceed $50,000 per year.

2. A lease that exceeds the limits stated in subsection (B)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the city council for approval. [Ord. 890 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 620 § 1, 2011; Ord. 446 § 4, 2007; Ord. 272 § 1, 2001]

	 	The flat rate service charge applies to single-family homes and parcels with less than 10 percent hard surface. The sliding rate service charge applies to all other properties in the service area. The sliding rate is calculated by measuring the amount of hard surface on each parcel and multiplying the appropriate rate by total acreage.

	 	Several special rate categories will automatically be assigned to those who qualify.

	 	1.	An exemption for any home owned and occupied by a low income senior citizen determined by the assessor to qualify under RCW 84.36.381.

The waiver shall be provided in accordance with the Surface Water Management Educational Fee Waiver procedure. The program will be reviewed by July 1, 2021.

	 	3.	Alternative Mobile Home Park Charge. Mobile home park assessment can be the lower of the appropriate rate category or the number of mobile home spaces multiplied by the single-family residential rate.

	C.	RATE ADJUSTMENTS

	 	Any person receiving a bill may file a request for a rate adjustment within two years of the billing date. (Filing a request will not extend the payment period.)

Property owners should file a request for a change in the rate assessed if:

	 	1.	The property acreage is incorrect;

	 	2.	The measured hard surface is incorrect;

	 	3.	The property is charged a sliding fee when the fee should be flat;

	 	4.	The person or property qualifies for an exemption or discount; or

	 	5.	The property is wholly or in part outside the service area.

	D.	REBATE

	 	Developed properties shall be eligible for the rebate under SMC 13.10.120 for constructing approved rain gardens or conservation landscaping at a rate of $2.50 per square foot not to exceed $2,000 for any parcel.

The city adopts the following system of registering the ownership of its bonds and obligations.

A. Registration Requirement. All bonds and obligations offered to the public, having a maturity of more than one year, on which the interest is intended to be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, shall be registered as to both principal and interest as provided in this chapter.



B. Method of Registration. The registration of all city bonds and obligations required to be registered shall be carried out either by:

1. A book entry system of recording the ownership of the bond or obligation on the books of the registrar, whether or not a physical instrument is issued; or

2. Recording the ownership of the bond or obligation and requiring as a condition of the transfer of ownership of any bond or obligation the surrender of the old bond or obligation and either the reissuance of the old bond or obligation or the issuance of a new bond or obligation to the new owner.

C. Denominations. Except as may be provided otherwise by the ordinance authorizing their issuance, registered bonds or obligations may be issued and reissued in any denomination up to the outstanding principal amount of the bonds or obligations of which they are a part. Such denominations may represent all or a part of a maturity or several maturities and on reissuance may be in smaller amounts than the individual denominations for which they are reissued.

D. Appointment of Registrar. Unless otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of registered bonds or obligations, the finance director shall be the registrar for all registered interest-bearing warrants, installment contracts, interest-bearing leases, and other registered bonds or obligations not usually subject to trading without a fixed maturity date or maturing one year or less after issuance and the fiscal agencies shall be the registrar for all other city bonds and obligations without a fixed maturity date or maturing more than one year after issuance.

E. Duties of Registrar. The registrar shall serve as the city’s authenticating trustee, transfer agent, registrar, and paying agent for all registered bonds and obligations for which they serve as registrar and shall comply fully with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations respecting the carrying out of those duties.

The rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation of the registrar shall be prescribed in each ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds or obligations, which rights, duties, responsibilities, and compensation shall be embodied in a contract executed by the city and the registrar, except that (i) when the fiscal agencies serve as registrar, the city adopts by reference the contract between the State Finance Committee of the State of Washington and the fiscal agencies in lieu of executing a separate contract and prescribing by ordinance the rights, duties, obligations and compensation of the registrar, and (ii) when the finance director serves as registrar, a separate contract shall not be required.

In all cases when the registrar is not the fiscal agencies and the bonds or obligations are assignable, the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the registered bonds or obligations shall specify the terms and conditions of:

1. Making payments of principal and interest;

2. Printing any physical instruments, including the use of identifying numbers or other designation;

3. Specifying record and payment dates;

A. Sales in Own Name – Sales or Purchases as Agent. Every person, including agents, consignees, bailees, factors or auctioneers having either actual or constructive possession of tangible personal property or having possession of the documents of title thereto, with power to sell such tangible personal property in the person’s own name and actually so selling shall be deemed the seller of such tangible personal property within the meaning of this chapter.

The burden shall be upon the taxpayer in every case to establish the fact that such taxpayer is not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property but is acting merely as broker or agent in promoting sales or making purchases for a principal. Such claim will be recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:

1. The books and records of the broker or agent show the transactions were made in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the name of the actual owner of the property for whom the sale was made, or the actual buyer for whom the purchase was made.

2. The books and records show the amount of the principal’s gross sales, the amount of commissions and any other incidental income derived by the broker or agent from such sales. The principal’s gross sales must not be reflected as the agent’s income on any of the agent’s books and records. Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement.

3. No ownership rights may be conferred to the agent unless the principal refuses to pay, or refuses to abide by the agency agreement. Sales or purchases of any goods by a person who has any ownership rights in such goods shall be taxed as retail or wholesale sales.

4. Bulk goods sold or purchased on behalf of a principal must not be commingled with goods belonging to another principal or lose their identity as belonging to the particular principal. Sales or purchases of any goods which have been comingled or lost their identity as belonging to the principal shall be taxed as retail or wholesale sales.

B. If the above requirements are not met, the consignor, bailor, principal or other shall be deemed a seller of such property to the agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.

C. Services in Own Name – Procuring Services as Agent. For purposes of this subsection, an agent is a person who acts under the direction and control of the principal in procuring services on behalf of the principal that the person could not itself render or supply. Amounts received by an agent for the account of its principal as advances or reimbursements are exempted from the measure of the tax only when the agent is not primarily or secondarily liable to pay for the services procured.

Any person who claims to be acting merely as agent in obtaining services for a principal will have such claim recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:

1. The books and records of the agent show that the services were obtained in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the actual principal for whom the purchase was made.

2. The books and records show the amount of the service that was obtained for the principal, the amount of commissions and any other income derived by the agent for acting as such. Amounts received from the principal as advances and reimbursements must not be reflected as the agent’s income on any of the agent’s books and records. Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement. [Ord. 808 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]

1. Upon every person engaging within the city in business as an extractor; as to such persons, the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products, including by-products, extracted within the city for sale or for commercial or industrial use, multiplied by the rate of one-tenth of one percent.

3.22.077 Allocation and apportionment of income when activities take place in more than one jurisdiction.

Gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of Chapter 82.14A RCW, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:

A. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under SMC 3.22.050(A)(7) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.

B. In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.

C. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

1. The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;

2. If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;

3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;

4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and

5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.

D. If none of the methods in subsection C of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (C)(5) of this section, then the city and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative method under this subsection. The city may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (C)(5) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the city are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.

1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:

a. The individual is primarily assigned within the city;

c. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of their service in any city and the employee resides in the city.

2. The service-income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the city if the customer location is in the city.

3. Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the city, and the gross income is attributable under subsection (F)(2) of this section to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (F)(3), “not taxable” means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.

4. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:

a. Separate accounting;

b. The exclusion of any one or more factors;

c. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; or

d. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

5. The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (F)(4) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence: 

a. That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; and 

b. That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable. 

The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

6. If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F. 

7. A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.

G. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section:

1. “Apportionable income” means the gross income of the business taxable under the service classifications of a city’s gross receipts tax, including income received from activities outside the city if the income would be taxable under the service classification if received from activities within the city, less any exemptions or deductions available.

4. “Customer” means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale or renders services or from whom the taxpayer otherwise receives gross income of the business.

5. “Customer location” means the following:

In computing the tax, a professional employer organization may deduct from the calculation of gross income the gross income of the business derived from performing professional employer services that is equal to the portion of the fee charged to a client that represents the actual cost of wages and salaries, benefits, workers’ compensation, payroll taxes, withholding, or other assessments paid to or on behalf of a covered employee by the professional employer organization under a professional employer agreement.

Such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]

Acceptance of any sum by the director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

B. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the city by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the U.S. Post Office upon the envelope containing it.

E. For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.

F. Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for any other reason will not be considered received until payment by certified check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a nonsufficient funds (NSF) charge of $20.00 is received by the director. Any license issued upon payment with an NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $20.00 NSF fee) is received.

G. The director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees when and as due under this chapter. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]


3.23.060 Records to be preserved – Examination – Estoppel to question assessment.

All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the director or its duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the director or a duly authorized agent.

B. If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the city, it shall be sufficient if such person:

1. Produces within the city such books and records as may be required by the director; or

2. Bears the cost of examination by the director’s agent at the place where such books and records are kept; provided, that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the director the estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.

3. Any person who fails, or refuses a request by the department or the director, to provide or make available records, or to allow inspection or examination of the business premises, shall be forever barred from questioning in any court action, the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the city for any period for which such records have not been provided, made available or kept and preserved, or in respect of which inspection or examination of the business premises has been denied. The director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]


3.23.070 Accounting methods.

A. A taxpayer may file tax returns in each reporting period with amounts based upon cash receipts only if the taxpayer’s books of account are kept on a cash receipts basis.

[Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]


3.23.090 Underpayment of tax, interest, or penalty – Interest.

A. If, upon examination of any returns, or from other information obtained by the director, it appears that a tax or penalty less than that properly due has been paid, the director shall assess the additional amount found to be due and shall add thereto interest on the tax only. The director shall notify the person by mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice, or within such time as the director may provide in writing.

B. The director shall compute interest in accordance with RCW 82.32.050 as it now exists or as it may be amended. If this provision is held to be invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.050 existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]

A. Against a person who is not currently registered or licensed or has not filed a tax return as required by this chapter for taxes due within the period commencing 10 years prior to the close of the calendar year in which the person was contacted in writing by the director;

A. If, upon receipt of an application for a refund, or during an audit or examination of the taxpayer’s records and tax returns, the director determines that the amount of tax, penalty, or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

B. The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for, or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the director discovers that a refund or credit is due.

C. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the director and by the issuance of a city check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.

E. The director shall compute interest on refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed a taxpayer in accordance with RCW 82.32.060, as it now exists or as it may be amended. If this provision is held to be invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.060 existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]

B. If the director determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid, as defined in RCW 82.32.090(2), there shall be added a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(2), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

No penalty shall be imposed under this provision if the person who has engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the director of the need to be licensed.

I. For the purposes of this section, “return” means any document a person is required by the city of Shoreline to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a statutorily defined due date.

J. If incorporation into the City of Shoreline Municipal Code of future changes to RCW 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.090 existing at the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]


3.23.120 Cancellation of penalties.

A. The director may cancel any penalties imposed under SMC 3.23.110(A) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date. The director has no authority to cancel any other penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in subsection C of this section.

B. A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the director within 30 calendar days after the date the department mails the notice that the penalties are due. The request must be in writing and contain competent proof of all pertinent facts supporting a reasonable cause determination. In all cases, the burden of proving the facts rests upon the taxpayer.

C. The director may cancel the penalties imposed under SMC 3.23.110(A) one time if a person:

B. Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the city from the taxpayer until such time as:

1. The taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the city showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due; or

2. More than six months have passed since the successor notified the director of the acquisition and the director has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment.

C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer.

D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the director of the acquisition, and the department does not within six months of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]

Interest and penalties assessed shall continue to accrue during the director’s review of a request for a correction, except, and to the extent, that the director later determines that a tax assessment was too high or the delay in issuing a determination is due to unreasonable delays caused by the director. The director shall make a final determination regarding the assessment and shall notify the taxpayer of the director’s determination within 60 calendar days after the conference, unless otherwise notified in writing by the director. Such determination shall be subject to appeal pursuant to subsection B of this section. If no request for correction is filed within the time period provided herein, the assessment covered by such notice shall become final and immediately due and payable, and no appeal to the hearing examiner shall be allowed.

B. Any person aggrieved by the amount of any fee, tax, interest or penalty determined by the department to be due under the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 3.22 SMC, Business and Occupation Tax; Chapter 3.32 SMC, Utility Tax; or Chapter 3.30 SMC, Gambling Tax, may appeal such determination pursuant to the following procedures:

3. Appeal Hearing. The city’s hearing examiner shall, as soon as practical, fix a time and place for the hearing of such appeal, and shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the parties. The hearing examiner shall conduct the appeal hearing in accordance with this chapter and procedures developed by the hearing examiner, at which time the appellant taxpayer and the director shall have the opportunity to be heard and to introduce evidence relevant to the subject of the appeal.

4. Burden of Proof. The appellant taxpayer shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination of the director is erroneous.

5. Hearing Record. The hearing examiner shall make an electronic sound recording of each appeal unless the hearing is conducted solely in writing. The hearing examiner may, by subpoena, require the attendance of any person at the hearing, and may also require them to produce pertinent books and records. Any person served with such a subpoena shall appear at the time and place therein stated and produce the books and records required, if any, and shall testify truthfully under oath administered by the hearing examiner as to any matter required of them pertinent to the appeal; and it shall be unlawful for them to fail or refuse to do so.

The written decision shall state the correct amount of the fee, tax, interest or penalty owing.

7. Interest Accrual or Payment. Interest and/or penalties shall continue to accrue on all unpaid amounts, in accordance with SMC 3.23.090 and 3.23.110, notwithstanding the fact that an appeal has been filed. If the hearing examiner determines that the taxpayer is owed a refund, such refund amount shall be paid to the taxpayer in accordance with SMC 3.23.100. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]


3.23.150 Judicial review of director’s determination.

Any person, except one who has failed to comply with SMC 3.23.060, having paid any tax as required and feeling aggrieved by the amount of the tax assessed, and after first exhausting the right of administrative appeal set forth in this chapter, may seek judicial review in the King County superior court within 21 calendar days of the date of the decision of the hearing examiner. The taxpayer shall set forth the amount of the tax imposed upon the taxpayer that the taxpayer concedes to be the correct amount of tax and the reason why the tax imposed should be reduced or abated. The trial in the superior court shall be de novo in accordance with the laws of the state of Washington. The burden shall rest upon the taxpayer to prove that the tax paid by the taxpayer is incorrect, either in whole or in part, and to establish the correct amount of the tax. [Ord. 808 § 2 (Exh. B), 2017]


3.23.160 Director to make rules.

The director shall have the power, from time to time, to adopt, publish and enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter or with law for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and it shall be unlawful to violate, or fail to comply with, any such rule or regulation.

2. “Tax information” means:

a. A taxpayer’s identity;

However, data, material, or documents that do not disclose information related to a specific or identifiable taxpayer do not constitute tax information under this section. Nothing in this chapter requires any person possessing data, material, or documents made confidential and privileged by this section to delete information from such data, material or documents so as to permit its disclosure.

3. “City agency” means every city office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other city agency.

However, tax information not received from the taxpayer must not be so disclosed if the director determines that such disclosure would compromise any investigation or litigation by any federal, state, or local government agency in connection with the civil or criminal liability of the taxpayer or another person, or that such disclosure would identify a confidential informant, or that such disclosure is contrary to any agreement entered into by the department that provides for the reciprocal exchange of information with other government agencies which agreement requires confidentiality with respect to such information unless such information is required to be disclosed to the taxpayer by the order of any court;

3. Publishing statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or reports or items thereof;

7. Disclosing any such return or tax information to the proper officer of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States, the Canadian government or provincial governments of Canada, or to the proper officer of the tax department of any state or city or town or county, for official purposes, but only if the statutes of the United States, Canada or its provincial governments, or of such other state or city or town or county, as the case may be, grant substantially similar privileges to the proper officers of the city;

8. Disclosing any such return or tax information to the United States Department of Justice, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Defense, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection agencies of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States Coast Guard, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Department of Treasury, and the United States Department of Transportation, or any authorized representative of these federal agencies or their successors, for official purposes;

However, the department may not disclose general ledgers, sales or cash receipt journals, check registers, accounts receivable/payable ledgers, general journals, financial statements, experts’ work papers, income tax returns, state tax returns, tax return work papers, or other similar data, materials, or documents.

a. The data, materials, or documents sought for disclosure are cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

4. The director must reimburse reasonable expenses for the production of data, materials, or documents incurred by the person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this section, a person served with a subpoena issued by the court or the hearing examiner may disclose the existence or content of the subpoena to that person’s legal counsel.

F. Any person acquiring knowledge of any return or tax information in the course of their employment with the city and any person acquiring knowledge of any return or tax information as provided under subsections (C)(4) through (C)(8) and subsection (C)(11) of this section, who discloses any such return or tax information to another person not entitled to knowledge of such return or tax information under the provisions of this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Chapter 3.55 SALE AND DISPOSAL OF REAL PROPERTY

Sections:

3.55.010    Policy and procedures for disposition of city-owned real property.

3.55.011    Surplus property declaration.

3.55.012    Sale procedure.

3.55.013    Exemptions from requirements of chapter.


3.55.010 Policy and procedures for disposition of city-owned real property.

A. Policy. The city council declares that it is in the public interest and the policy of the city to dispose of all real property interests in which the city holds a fee, leasehold, easement or license interest, where such property is surplus to its current or future needs, and where such disposition would afford the city a reasonable return from the sale of fee property. For purposes of this chapter, “reasonable return” means sale at an amount equal to, or greater than, the fair market value under SMC 3.55.012. For purposes of this chapter, “surplus property” means both real property for which the city has no current or future need, as well as real property, which, if disposed of, would be put to a higher or better use for the community at large.

B. Procedures. Real property declared surplus may be disposed of for a reasonable return by any of the procedures of this chapter unless: (1) the property is authorized for special disposition process by the city council; or (2) the property was originally acquired for public utility purposes, in which case it shall be sold for fair market value pursuant to RCW 35.94.040.

C. Special Disposition Process. In cases where the public interest in a reasonable return is outweighed by the public benefit, due to factors such as the unique character or development potential of a given property, the city council may designate such property for disposal by a request for proposals, sealed bid, options to purchase, lease-purchase transactions, or other commonly used, commercially reasonable means of disposal. If an intergovernmental transfer is considered for a special disposition process, this chapter shall be supplemented with procedures of Chapter 39.33 RCW. [Ord. 677 § 1, 2013; Ord. 626 § 1, 2012]


3.55.011 Surplus property declaration.

A. Real property owned by the city may be declared surplus by the city council after the following procedures have been completed:

1. The city manager shall include the following information in the staff report to council for each parcel under consideration:

a. Description of the subject parcel’s size, general location, and legal description;

b. Description of the circumstances under which the subject parcel was obtained;

c. Description of what funds were used to initially acquire the subject parcel;

d. Recommendation as to which fund the proceeds from its sale should be credited;

e. History of municipal use, if any, or uses for which it might be held;

f. Value of the subject parcel and whether further appraisal before sale is recommended and the type of appraisal required (see SMC 3.55.012(A)(2));

g. Whether the subject parcel is only usable by abutting owners or is marketable;

h. Whether special consideration ought to be given to some other public agency that has a use for the subject parcel;

i. Whether the subject parcel should be sold at auction, by sealed bid, by a licensed real estate broker, or by negotiation;

j. Recommendation as to whether any special covenants or restrictions should be imposed in conjunction with sale of the subject parcel;

k. For land acquired for public utility purposes, whether the land is no longer required to provide continued public utility service.

2. A public hearing shall be held to consider the surplus declaration for the subject parcel. Notice of said hearing shall be published in the city’s official newspaper and mailed to all property owners within 500 feet of the subject parcel not less than 10 days nor more than 25 days prior to the hearing.

B. Following the public hearing, the council shall determine whether the subject parcel shall be declared surplus. Any declaration of surplus property shall be made by resolution. The resolution shall also make the following determinations:

1. Whether the subject parcel should be sold by sealed bid, at auction, by a licensed real estate broker, or through negotiated sale;

2. Whether special covenants or restrictions should be imposed as a condition of the sale; and

3. The minimum acceptable price, in accordance with SMC 3.55.010(B) and 3.55.012. [Ord. 809 § 1, 2017; Ord. 626 § 1, 2012]


3.55.012 Sale procedure.

The following procedures and requirements shall apply to the sale of surplus property:

A. Determination of Value/Minimum Acceptable Price.

1. If the city has a sufficient and acceptable appraisal of the subject property, no additional appraisal shall be required.

2. If an acceptable appraisal is not available, the city manager shall obtain:

a. Limited opinion of value for properties under $25,000;

b. Short form appraisal report for properties under $50,000; or

c. Full narrative appraisal report.

B. Sale by Bid or Auction. In the event the subject parcel is to be disposed of by sealed bid or by auction, the following notification procedures shall be followed:

1. A notice of the city’s intent to dispose of the subject parcel shall be conspicuously posted on the property no less than two weeks prior to the date set for the close of bids or the date set for the auction.

2. Notice shall be published in the city’s official newspaper at least once each week for three consecutive weeks preceding the deadline for the submittal of sealed bids or the public auction. All notices shall include a description of the subject parcel, the procedure by which the subject parcel is to be disposed of, any earnest money deposits which must be made and the minimum price that will be accepted.

C. Negotiated Sale. If the subject parcel can only be put to its highest and best use when aggregated with an abutter’s property because of its size, shape, topography, or other restriction, the subject parcel may be negotiated for sale to the abutter, provided:

1. The abutter is willing to purchase for the fair market value of the subject parcel as determined under subsection A of this section;

2. If more than one qualifying abutter expresses interest in purchasing the subject parcel, the city council may solicit sealed bids from all; and

3. A person shall not be deemed to be an abutter if a right-of-way separates their property from the subject parcel unless purchase will allow a higher and better use of the abutter’s property.

1. The real estate broker shall be licensed in the state of Washington;

2. The property shall be listed for no less than the appraised fair market value or the price set by the council;

3. The property must be advertised on the open market for a minimum of two weeks by the use of newspapers, real estate multiple listing services, or other commercially reasonable methods; and

4. The broker’s commission rate will be no more than that otherwise charged in the Shoreline area for such services.

E. Earnest Money/Time to Closing.

1. Disposition by Sealed Bid or Auction. Where a subject parcel is sold by sealed bids or auction, any and all bids submitted must be accompanied by a bid deposit in the form of a cashier’s check payable to the city of Shoreline in the amount of five percent of the bid or $5,000, whichever is greater. Such deposit accompanying the successful bid shall be deposited into an administrative trust account until closing on the purchase of the parcel and payment of the remaining amount of the purchase price shall be made within 30 days. In the event the purchaser is unable to pay the remaining amount within the required time, the earnest money deposit shall become nonrefundable as liquidated damages; provided, however, that the purchaser may deposit an additional $5,000 extension fee, in which case the time to make full payment shall be extended for an additional 30 days. In the event full payment is not made by the conclusion of the additional period, all deposits shall be retained as liquidated damages for lost time and expense. The city council reserves the right to waive any irregularities in the bid process.

2. Disposition by Broker Sale or Negotiated Sale. Where property is sold by real estate broker sale or negotiated sale, the purchaser shall deposit earnest money into escrow in the amount of $5,000 or five percent, whichever is greater, within three business days of execution of a purchase and sale agreement for the purchase of the subject parcel. Earnest money forfeitures and sale extensions under subsection (E)(1) of this section shall apply.

F. Form of Conveyance. All conveyances shall be made by quitclaim deed.

G. Closing Costs. All closing costs, exclusive of deed preparation, shall be borne by the purchaser including, but not limited to, survey work, title insurance if desired, recording costs, and escrow fees if applicable. [Ord. 809 § 2, 2017; Ord. 626 § 1, 2012]

“Building permit” means written permission issued by the city empowering the holder thereof to construct, erect, alter, enlarge, convert, reconstruct, remodel, rehabilitate, repair, or change the use of all or portions of a structure having a roof supported by columns or walls and intended for the shelter, housing, or enclosure of any individual, animal, process, equipment, goods, or materials of any kind.

An impact fee does not include a reasonable permit fee or application fee. An impact fee does not include the administrative fee for collecting and handling impact fees or the fee for reviewing independent fee calculations.

“Impact fee account” means the separate accounting structure within the city’s established accounts which shall identify separately earmarked funds and which shall be established for the impact fees that are collected.

“Independent fee calculation” means the impact fee calculation, studies and data submitted by an applicant to support the assessment of a parks, open space, and recreation impact fee other than by the use of the rates published in SMC 3.01.016(A), or the calculations prepared by the director where none of the fee categories or fee amounts in SMC 3.01.016 accurately describe or capture the impacts on park facilities of the development authorized by the building permit.

“Multifamily residential” for the purpose of this chapter has the same meaning as set forth in SMC 20.20.016 for “dwelling, multifamily” and includes accessory dwelling units.

“Open space” means undeveloped public land that is permanently protected from development, except for the development of trails or other passive public access and uses.

“Parks facilities” means parks, open space, and recreational facilities, including but not limited to ball fields, athletic fields, soccer fields, swimming pools, tennis courts, regional parks, urban parks, community parks, neighborhood parks, pocket parks, natural areas, special use facilities, and trail corridors owned or operated by the city of Shoreline or other governmental entities.

“Project improvements” means site improvements and facilities that are planned and designed to provide service for a particular development project and that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the project, and are not system improvements.

3.70.040 Impact fees methodology and applicability.

The parks, open space, and recreation impact fees in SMC 3.01.016 are generated from the formulae for calculating parks, open space, and recreation impact fees set forth in the rate study. Except as otherwise provided for independent fee calculations in SMC 3.70.060, exemptions in SMC 3.70.070, and credits in SMC 3.70.080, all building permits issued by the city will be charged impact fees applicable to the type of development listed in the fee schedule adopted pursuant to SMC 3.01.016. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.050 Collection of impact fees.

A. The city shall collect impact fees for parks, open space, and recreation, based on the rates in SMC 3.01.016, from any applicant seeking a building permit from the city unless specifically exempted in SMC 3.70.070.

B. When an impact fee applies to a building permit for a change of use of an existing building, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the new use, less any impact fee paid for the immediately preceding use. The preceding use shall be determined by the most recent legally established use based on a locally owned business license and development permit documents.

1. For purposes of this provision, a change of use should be reviewed based on the land use category provided in the rate study that best captures the broader use or development activity of the property under development or being changed. Changes of use and minor changes in tenancies that are consistent with the general character of the building or building aggregations (i.e., “industrial park,” or “specialty retail”), or the previous use, shall not be considered a change of use that is subject to an impact fee.

2. If no impact fee was paid for the immediately preceding use, the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to the current impact fee rate for the immediately preceding use.

3. If the calculated impact fee is a negative amount, the applicant will not be required to pay impact fees nor will the applicant be compensated by the city for a negative impact fee.

C. For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each land use, based on the applicable measurement in the impact fee rates in SMC 3.01.016.

D. Impact fees shall be determined at the time the complete application for a building permit is submitted using the impact fees then in effect. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, impact fees shall be due and payable before the building permit is issued by the city.

E. Applicants allowed credits prior to the submittal of the complete building permit application shall submit, along with the complete application, a copy of the letter prepared by the director setting forth the dollar amount of the credit allowed.

Deferral of impact fees are considered under the following conditions:

1. An applicant for deferral must request the deferral no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.

2. For the purposes of this deferral program, the following definitions apply:

a. “Applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant.

b. “Single-family residence” means a permit for a single-family dwelling unit, attached or detached, as defined in SMC 20.20.016.

3. To receive a deferral, an applicant must:

a. Submit a deferred impact fee application and acknowledgment form for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the applicant wishes to defer payment of the impact fees;

b. Pay the applicable administrative fee;

c. Grant and record at the applicant’s expense a deferred impact fee lien in a form approved by the city against the property in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee that:

i. Includes the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property;

ii. Requires payment of the impact fees to the city prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, whichever occurs first;

iii. Is signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed and recorded in King County;

iv. Binds all successors in title after the recordation; and

v. Is junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

4. The amount of impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

5. Prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, the applicant may pay the deferred amount in installments, with no penalty for early payment.

6. The city shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the city shall execute a release of deferred impact fee lien for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or property owner at the time of release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at their expense.

7. The extinguishment of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

8. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with the deferral and in accordance with the term provisions established herein, the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

9. Each applicant for a single-family attached or detached residential building permit, in accordance with their contractor registration number or other unique identification number, is entitled to annually receive deferrals under this section for the first 21 single-family residential construction building permits.

10. The city shall collect an administrative fee from the applicant seeking to defer the payment of impact fees under this section as provided in SMC 3.01.016(B). [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.060 Independent fee calculations.

A. If, in the judgment of the director, none of the fee categories set forth in SMC 3.01.016 accurately describes or captures the impacts of a new development on park facilities, the director may conduct independent fee calculations and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations. The alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the applicant.

B. An applicant may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the fee structure in SMC 3.01.016, in which case the applicant shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development for which a building permit is being sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made. An independent fee calculation shall use the same methodology used to establish impact fees adopted pursuant to SMC 3.01.016.

C. There is a rebuttable presumption that the calculations set forth in the rate study are valid. The director shall consider the documentation submitted by the applicant, but is not required to accept such documentation or analysis which the director reasonably deems to be inapplicable, inaccurate, incomplete, or unreliable. The director may require the applicant to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. The fees or alternative fees and the calculations therefor shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the applicant. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]

3.70.080 Credits for dedications, construction of improvements, and past tax payments.

A. An applicant may request that a credit or credits for impact fees be awarded to them for the total value of system improvements, including dedications of land and improvements, and/or construction provided by the applicant. The application for credits shall be presented by the applicant on forms to be provided by the director and shall include the content designated in such forms. Credits will be given only if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are:

1. Included within the capital facilities plan;

2. Determined by the city to be at suitable sites and constructed at acceptable quality;

3. Serve to offset impacts of the development authorized by the applicant’s building permit; and

4. Part of one or more of the projects listed in Exhibit B1 of the rate study as the basis for calculating the parks, open space, and recreation impact fee; however, frontage improvements for those projects are not eligible for credits unless the director determines that the frontage improvements will not be replaced or significantly changed when the project is constructed.

1. For each request for a credit or credits, the director shall select an appraiser or, in the alternative, the applicant may select an independent appraiser acceptable to the director.

2. Unless approved otherwise by the director, the appraiser must be a member of the American Institute of Appraisers and be licensed in good standing pursuant under Chapter 18.40 RCW et seq. in the category for the property to be appraised, and shall not have a fiduciary or personal interest in the property being appraised.

3. The applicant shall pay the actual costs for the appraisal and an independent review, if required.

4. After considering the appraisal the director shall provide the applicant with a written determination setting forth the dollar amount of any credit, the reason for the credit, a description of the real property dedicated, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such determination accepting the terms of the letter or certificate, and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 calendar days of the date of the determination shall nullify the credit. If credit is denied, the applicant shall be notified in a letter that includes the reasons for denial.

5. No credit shall be given for project improvements.

C. An applicant may request a credit for past tax for past payments made for the particular system improvements listed in the rate study as the basis for the impact fee. For each request for a credit for past payments the applicant shall submit receipts and a calculation of past payments earmarked for or proratable to the particular system improvement for which credit is requested. The director shall determine the amount of credits, if any, for past payments for system improvements.

D. Any claim for credit must be received by the city prior to issuance of the building permit. The failure to timely file such a claim shall constitute an absolute bar to later request any such credit. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.090 Adjustments for future tax payments and other revenue sources.

Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the rate study has provided adjustments for future taxes to be paid by the development authorized by the building permit which are earmarked or proratable to the same new park facilities which will serve the new development. The impact fees in SMC 3.01.016 have been reasonably adjusted for taxes and other revenue sources which are anticipated to be available to fund parks, open space, and recreation improvements. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.100 Establishment of impact fee accounts.

A. The city shall establish a separate impact fee account for the parks, open space, and recreation impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter. Funds appropriated or otherwise withdrawn from the impact fees received must be used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and applicable state law. Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the accounts and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected.

B. On an annual basis, the director or designee shall provide a report to the council on the impact fee accounts showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the parks, open space, and recreation improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.

C. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings extraordinary and compelling reasons for the city to hold the fees beyond the 10-year period, pursuant to RCW 82.02.070(3). [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.110 Refunds and offsets.

A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within 10 years of the date the fees were paid, unless extraordinary or compelling reasons are established pursuant to this section, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis.

B. The city shall notify potential claimants of the refund by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant must be the current owner of record of the real property against which the impact fees were assessed.

C. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the director within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.

D. Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on the system improvements for which they were collected.

E. Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city.

F. When the city seeks to terminate any or all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this chapter. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail at the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the park facilities for which the impact fees were collected. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

G. The city shall also refund to the current owner of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur; provided, however, that, if the city has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund, the director may decline to provide the refund. If within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar building permit, the owner can petition the director for an offset in the amount of the fee originally paid and not refunded. The petitioner must provide receipts of impact fees previously paid for a building permit of the same or substantially similar nature on the same real property or some portion thereof. The director’s determinations shall be in writing and shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in SMC 3.70.140. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.120 Use of impact fees.

A. Pursuant to this chapter, impact fees:

1. Shall be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development authorized by the building permit;

2. Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in park facilities; and

3. Shall not be used for maintenance or operation.

B. Impact fees may be spent for system improvements including, but not limited to, planning, land acquisition, right-of-way acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, applicable impact fees or mitigation costs, and any other expenses which can be capitalized.

C. Impact fees may also be used to recoup system improvement costs previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs.

D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, such impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.130 Review and adjustment of rates.

A. The fees and rates set forth in the rate study may be reviewed and adjusted by the council as it deems necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the budget process so that adjustments, if any, will be effective at the first of the calendar year subsequent to budget period under review.

B. Consistent with SMC 3.01.820, the director shall adjust the fees by the same percentage changes as in the most recent annual change of the Construction Cost Index published in the Engineering News-Record (ENR) for the Seattle area. [Ord. 816 § 2(D), 2018; Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.140 Appeals.

Determinations and decisions by the director that are appealed by an applicant shall follow the procedures for a Type B administrative decision as set forth in Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 4. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.70.150 Existing authority unimpaired.

Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the applicant or the proponent of a development authorized by a building permit to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the building permit process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions. Such mitigation shall not duplicate the impact fees charged under this chapter. [Ord. 786 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017]

A. The city shall collect impact fees for fire protection facilities, based on the rates provided by the fire department and adopted in SMC 3.01.017, from any applicant seeking a building permit unless specifically exempted in SMC 3.75.070. The city shall also collect an administrative fee from the applicant as provided in SMC 3.01.017(B).

B. When an impact fee applies to a building permit for a change of use of an existing building, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the new use, less any impact fee paid for the immediately preceding use. The preceding use shall be determined by the most recent legally established use based on a locally owned business license and development permit documents.

1. For purposes of this provision, a change of use should be reviewed based on the land use category that best captures the broader use or development activity of the property under development or being changed. Changes of use and minor changes in tenancies that are consistent with the general character of the building or building aggregations (i.e., “industrial park,” or “specialty retail”), or the previous use, shall not be considered a change of use that is subject to an impact fee.

2. If no impact fee was paid for the immediately preceding use, the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to the current impact fee rate for the immediately preceding use.

3. If the calculated impact fee is a negative amount, the applicant will not be required to pay impact fees nor will the applicant be compensated by the city for a negative impact fee.

C. For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each land use, based on the applicable measurement in the impact fee rates in SMC 3.01.017(A).

D. Impact fees shall be estimated at the time the complete application for a building permit is submitted using the impact fee rates then in effect. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, impact fees shall be due and payable before the building permit is issued by the city.

E. Applicants allowed credits pursuant to SMC 3.75.080 shall submit documentation from the fire department setting forth the credits allowed prior to building permit issuance. Credits shall be applied at the time of impact fee collection unless otherwise authorized by the fire department.

F. Single-Family Residential Deferral Program. An applicant for a building permit for a single-family detached or attached residence may request a deferral of the full impact fee payment until final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of impact fees are considered under the following conditions:

1. An applicant for deferral must request the deferral no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.

2. For the purposes of this deferral program, the following definitions apply:

a. “Applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant.

b. “Single-family residence” means a permit for a single-family dwelling unit, attached or detached, as defined in SMC 20.20.016.

3. To receive a deferral, an applicant must:

a. Submit a deferred impact fee application and acknowledgment form for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the applicant wishes to defer payment of the impact fees;

b. Pay the applicable administrative fee;

c. Grant and record at the applicant’s expense a deferred impact fee lien in a form approved by the city against the property in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee that:

i. Includes the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property;

ii. Requires payment of the impact fees to the city prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, whichever occurs first;

iii. Is signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed and recorded in King County;

iv. Binds all successors in title after the recordation; and

v. Is junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

4. The amount of impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

5. Prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, the applicant may pay the deferred amount in installments, with no penalty for early payment.

6. The city shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the city shall execute a release of deferred impact fee lien for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or property owner at the time of release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at their expense.

7. The extinguishment of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

[Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.050 Collection of impact fees.

A. The city shall collect impact fees for transportation, based on the rates in SMC 3.01.015, from any applicant seeking a building permit from the city unless specifically exempted in SMC 3.80.070.

B. When an impact fee applies to a building permit for a change of use of an existing building, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the new use, less any impact fee paid for the immediately preceding use. The preceding use shall be determined by the most recent legally established use based on a locally owned business license and development permit documents.

1. For purposes of this provision, a change of use should be reviewed based on the land use category provided in the rate study that best captures the broader use or development activity of the property under development or being changed. Changes of use and minor changes in tenancies that are consistent with the general character of the building or building aggregations (i.e., “industrial park,” or “specialty retail”), or the previous use, shall not be considered a change of use that is subject to an impact fee.

2. If no impact fee was paid for the immediately preceding use, the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to the current impact fee rate for the immediately preceding use.

3. If the calculated impact fee is a negative amount, the applicant will not be required to pay impact fees nor will the applicant be compensated by the city for a negative impact fee.

C. For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each land use, based on the applicable measurement in the impact fee rates in SMC 3.01.015.

D. Impact fees shall be determined at the time the complete application for a building permit is submitted using the impact fees then in effect. Impact fees shall be due and payable before the building permit is issued by the city.

F. Single-Family Residential Deferral Program. An applicant for a building permit for a single-family detached or attached residence may request a deferral of the full impact fee payment until final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of impact fees is considered under the following conditions:

1. An applicant for deferral must request the deferral no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.

2. For the purposes of this deferral program, the following definitions apply:

a. “Applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant.

b. “Single-family residence” means a permit for a single-family house as set forth in SMC 3.01.015(A), ITE Code 210.

3. To receive a deferral, an applicant must:

a. Submit a deferred impact fee application and acknowledgment form for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the applicant wishes to defer payment of the impact fees;

b. Pay the applicable administrative fee;

c. Grant and record at the applicant’s expense a deferred impact fee lien in a form approved by the city against the property in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee that:

i. Includes the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property;

ii. Requires payment of the impact fees to the city prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, whichever occurs first;

iii. Is signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed and recorded in King County;

iv. Binds all successors in title after the recordation; and

v. Is junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

4. The amount of impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral.

5. Prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, the applicant may pay the deferred amount in installments, with no penalty for early payment.

6. The city shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the city shall execute a release of deferred impact fee lien for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or property owner at the time of release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at their expense.

7. The extinguishment of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection.

8. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with the deferral and in accordance with the term provisions established herein, the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

9. Each applicant for a single-family attached or detached residential construction permit, in accordance with their contractor registration number or other unique identification number, is entitled to annually receive deferrals under this section for the first 21 single-family residential construction building permits.

10. The city shall collect an administrative fee from the applicant seeking to defer the payment of impact fees under this section as provided in SMC 3.01.015(B). [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.060 Independent fee calculations.

A. If, in the judgment of the director, none of the fee categories set forth in SMC 3.01.015 accurately describes or captures the impacts of a new development on transportation facilities, the director may conduct independent fee calculations and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations. The alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the applicant.

B. An applicant may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the fee structure in SMC 3.01.015, in which case the applicant shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development for which a building permit is being sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made. An independent fee calculation shall use the same methodology used to establish impact fees adopted pursuant to SMC 3.01.015, and shall be limited to adjustments in trip generation rates and lengths for transportation impact fees.

C. There is a rebuttable presumption that the calculations set forth in the rate study are valid. The director shall consider the documentation submitted by the applicant, but is not required to accept such documentation or analysis which the director reasonably deems to be inapplicable, inaccurate, incomplete, or unreliable. The director may require the applicant to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. The fees or alternative fees and the calculations therefor shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the applicant. [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]

A), 2017]


3.80.100 Establishment of impact fee accounts.

A. The city shall establish a separate impact fee account for the transportation impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter.

C. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings extraordinary and compelling reasons for the city to hold the fees beyond the 10-year period, pursuant to RCW 82.02.070(3). [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.110 Refunds and offsets.

A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within 10 years of the date the fees were paid, unless extraordinary or compelling reasons are established pursuant to this section, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis.

B. The city shall notify potential claimants of the refund by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant must be the current owner of record of the real property against which the impact fees were assessed.

C. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the director within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.

D. Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on the system improvements for which they were collected.

E. Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city.

F. When the city seeks to terminate any or all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this chapter. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail at the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the transportation facilities for which the impact fees were collected. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

G. The city shall also refund to the current owner of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur; provided, however, that, if the city has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund, the director may decline to provide the refund. If within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar building permit, the owner can petition the director for an offset in the amount of the fee originally paid and not refunded. The petitioner must provide receipts of impact fees previously paid for a building permit of the same or substantially similar nature on the same real property or some portion thereof. The director’s determinations shall be in writing and shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in SMC 3.80.140. [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.120 Use of impact fees.

A. Pursuant to this chapter, impact fees:

1. Shall be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development authorized by the building permit;

2. Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in transportation facilities; and

3. Shall not be used for maintenance or operation.

B. Impact fees may be spent for system improvements including, but not limited to, planning, land acquisition, right-of-way acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, applicable impact fees or mitigation costs, and any other expenses which can be capitalized.

C. Impact fees may also be used to recoup system improvement costs previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs.

D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, such impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.130 Review and adjustment of rates.

A. The fees and rates set forth in the rate study may be reviewed and adjusted by the council as it deems necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the budget process so that adjustments, if any, will be effective at the first of the calendar year subsequent to budget period under review.

B. Consistent with SMC 3.01.820, the director shall adjust the fees by the same percentage changes as in the most recent annual change of the Construction Cost Index published in the Engineering News-Records (ENR) for the Seattle area. [Ord. 848 § 1, 2018; Ord. 816 § 2(F), 2018; Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.140 Appeals.

Determinations and decisions by the director that are appealed by an applicant shall follow the procedures for a Type B administrative decision as set forth in Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 4. [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]


3.80.150 Existing authority unimpaired.

Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the applicant or the proponent of a development authorized by a building permit to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the building permit process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions. Compliance with this chapter or payment of fees under this chapter shall not constitute evidence of a determination of transportation concurrency. Such mitigation shall not duplicate the impact fees charged under this chapter. [Ord. 792 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017]

C. The clerk may refer applications to the planning and development services department, the police department, or other governmental agencies for their review. Compliance with building, zoning and other laws is the business owner’s responsibility and issuance of a business license is not a guarantee of compliance or a waiver of future enforcement by the city or other agency with jurisdiction.

A person who acquires an existing business must make application for a city business license before commencing business within the city with that business. A licensee must report a change of location of the business to the clerk. A change of the location of a business requires approval by the city before business may commence at the new location, and may require submitting a new business license application and payment of fees.

G. License renewals are handled by the city. Renewal of the city license requires payment of fees, including handling fees. [Ord. 831 § 1 (Exh. A(1)), 2018; Ord. 543 § 1, 2009]

C. If conducting business within the city, businesses registered with the Washington Secretary of State as a nonprofit corporation must obtain a city business license, but are exempt from paying the city’s business license fee. [Ord. 543 § 1, 2009]


5.05.080 Penalty for late renewal.

Licenses must be renewed annually on or before the expiration date, or expiration of any prorated period. Failure to renew a business license by the license expiration date may result in the assessment of a late renewal penalty in accordance with Chapter 3.01 SMC. Nonrenewal may require reapplication for the city license, and approval by the city. [Ord. 831 § 1 (Exh. A(1)), 2018; Ord. 543 § 1, 2009]


5.05.090 License – Suspension, denial or revocation.

2. To comply with the requirements of this chapter.

B. The clerk shall, by certified mail, give written notice to the applicant of denial of a license or to the licensee of suspension or revocation of a license, including a summary of the complaints, objections and information considered by the clerk and the reason(s) for the action. Notice mailed to the mailing address on the application or most recent renewal shall be deemed received three days after mailing. The clerk’s decision may be appealed to the city hearing examiner upon payment of the appropriate appeal fee.

C. Any suspension or revocation shall remain in effect until the conditions causing the suspension or revocation are cured and reasonable measures are taken to ensure that those conditions will not recur.

D. Appeals of any license suspension, revocation or denial shall be heard by the Shoreline hearing examiner. An appeal statement must be filed with the city clerk within 14 days of the decision being appealed. [Ord. 543 § 1, 2009]

This includes but is not limited to the studies relied upon, and findings of fact entered by, the city councils of the cities of Bellevue, Tukwila, SeaTac, and Federal Way in their respective adult cabaret ordinances.

B. Additionally, the city council enters the following findings of fact related to adult cabaret activity within the city of Shoreline:

1. Much like the documented activity in other cities with nude and semi-nude adult cabaret entertainment, illegal sexual activity occurs regularly and repetitively in Shoreline’s adult cabarets.

2. Undercover police officers personally experienced, and personally observed, “table dances” involving regular exposure by the entertainer of breasts, buttocks, and pubic area. The “dances” also frequently featured masturbation by the entertainer of the customer’s groin area.

3. The entertainers feature two types of dances, one costing $10.00 and the other costing $20.00. A $20.00 dance takes place in a darkened area of the cabaret, where managers and others have difficulty viewing the illegal activity.

The council may, by ordinance, award a nonexclusive franchise to construct, operate and maintain a cable television system which complies with the terms and conditions of this chapter.

 Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive and shall not preclude the city from granting other or further franchises or permits or preclude the city from using any public rights-of-way, streets, or other public properties or affect its jurisdiction over them or any part of them, or limit the full power of the city to make such changes, as the city shall deem necessary, including the dedication, establishment, maintenance, and improvement of all new public rights-of-way and other public properties. However, any such changes shall not materially or substantially impair the rights granted a franchisee pursuant to this chapter or any franchise. All franchises granted subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be granted consistent with the terms and conditions of this chapter. Inasmuch as Chapter 12.25 SMC, establishing minimum requirement procedures and application information for franchise and right-of-way use agreements within Shoreline, is the paramount pertinent local regulatory ordinance, in the event of any conflict between this chapter and Chapter 12.25 SMC, the latter shall be the prevailing document.

B. Incorporation By Reference.  The provisions of this chapter shall be incorporated by reference in any cable franchise ordinances or licenses approved hereunder. The provisions of any proposal submitted and accepted by the city shall be incorporated by reference in the applicable franchise. However, in the event of any conflict between the proposal, this chapter and the franchise, the franchise shall be the prevailing document.

C. Nature and Extent of the Franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder by the city shall authorize a franchisee, subject to the provisions herein contained:

1. To engage in the business of operating and providing cable service and the distribution and sale of such service to subscribers within the city.

No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred upon a franchisee by any franchise except those specifically prescribed therein, and any use of any street shall be consistent with any prior lawful occupancy of the street or any subsequent improvement or installation therein.

3. The franchise granted hereunder does not include authorization for providing services as a telephone business as defined by RCW 82.04.065. [Ord. 156 § M2, 1998]

7. That the proposed franchise is consistent with the city’s present and future use of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable television system;

8. That the benefit to the public from the cable television system outweighs the potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable television system, and the resultant inconvenience which may occur to the public; and

9. That all other conditions resulting from the grant of the franchise have been considered by the city and that the city determines that the grant is still in the public’s best interest.

B. Renewal Franchise.

1. That the franchisee has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise.

2. That the quality of the franchisee’s previous service including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs.

3. That a franchisee’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.

4. That a franchisee has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in a franchisee’s proposal.

[Ord. 156 § M5, 1998]


5.20.060 Rules and regulations by the city.

In addition to the inherent powers of the city to regulate and control any franchise it issues, the authority granted to it by the Act, and those powers expressly reserved by the city, or agreed to and provided for in a franchise, the right and power is hereby reserved by the city to promulgate such additional regulations of general applicability as it may find necessary in the exercise of its lawful police powers giving due regard to the right of the franchisee. The city council reserves the right to delegate its authority for franchise administration to a designated agent. Except as noted above, the foregoing does not allow for amendment by the city of material terms of any franchise it issues without the consent of a franchisee. [Ord. 156 § M6, 1998]


5.20.070 Construction standards.

All cable facilities constructed under this chapter shall be placed and maintained at such places and positions in or upon such public rights-of-way and public places as shall not interfere with the passage of traffic and the use of adjoining property, and shall conform to the applicable section of the National Electrical Code, codes of the state of Washington, and city rules, regulations, ordinances, codes, standards and policies pertaining to such construction.

The city reserves the right, as the interest of the public may require, to ensure that (1) the public rights-of-way have the capacity to accommodate the cable television system, (2) the proposed construction is consistent with the city’s present and future use of the public rights-of-way, (3) the benefit to the public from the construction of the cable television system outweighs the potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way and the resultant inconvenience which may occur to the public, and may require the installation or construction of new cable facilities proposed by the franchisee to be constructed in arterial thoroughfares or to be installed in alternate public rights-of-way which are substantially comparable in terms of the expense to franchisee for installation or construction, and which provide distribution to all affected parcels of property that is equal or better to the requested installation route. The city shall give particular preference to the alternate installation location in cases in which the existing improvements to the public right-of-way would be affected by the proposed installation, or where the structural integrity of the surface of the right-of-way, or inconvenience to the public caused by the proposed installation cannot be mitigated through alternative means.

A. Notice of Entry on Private Property.

[Ord. 156 § M17, 1998]

5.20.190 Audit by city.

Subject to statutory and constitutional limits and upon not less than 10 business days’ advance written notice, the city reserves the right to inspect the records of a franchisee, which are not a part of its public files but which are necessary for the enforcement of a franchise, during normal business hours; provided, that the city shall maintain the confidentiality of any trade secrets or other proprietary information in the possession of a franchisee. Such documents shall include such information as financial records, subscriber records and plans pertaining to a franchisee’s operation in the city; provided, nothing in this chapter shall be read to require a franchisee to violate state or federal law respecting subscriber privacy, nor shall this chapter be read to require a franchisee to disclose confidential or proprietary information without adequate safeguards to protect its confidential or proprietary nature.

The city may request a franchisee to begin negotiations to interconnect PEG access channels of a cable television system with other cable system(s) within the city. Interconnection of system may be accomplished by direct cable connection, microwave link, or other technically feasible method.

Upon receiving request of the city to interconnect, if a franchise has not already done so, a franchisee shall initiate negotiations with other affected system(s), and shall report to the city the results of such negotiations no later than 60 days after such initiation.

If no agreement is reached within 120 days from the date of the city’s request, the parties shall within 150 days of the request enter into an alternate dispute resolution process of their choice and shall notify the city regarding the dispute resolution process. Failure of the parties to reach agreement within 180 days from the date of the city’s request, or to participate in good faith in a dispute resolution procedure as required herein, shall subject a franchisee to appropriate penalties in accordance with provisions of the franchise ordinance. [Ord. 156 § M21, 1998]


5.20.220 Institutional networks (I-Nets).

If required in its franchise, a franchisee’s cable television system shall have the capability of serving designated educational and public buildings with uni- or bi-directional video/audio signals (the “I-Net”).

[Ord. 156 § M22, 1998]


5.20.230 City-wide institutional networks interconnection.

A franchise agreement may require a franchisee to make such interconnections as necessary to connect certain designated institutions on a city-wide basis.

5.20.250 Nondiscrimination.

In connection with rates, charges, cable facilities, rules, regulations and in all franchisee’s services, programs or activities, and all franchisee’s hiring and employment made possible by or resulting from this franchise, there shall be no discrimination by franchisee or by franchisee’s employees, agents, subcontractors or representatives against any person because of sex, age (except minimum age and retirement provisions), race, creed, national origin, marital status or the presence of any disability, including sensory, mental or physical handicaps, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification in relationship to hiring and employment. This requirement shall apply, but not be limited to, the following: employment, advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Franchisee shall not violate any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation regarding nondiscrimination.

Any material violation of this provision may be grounds for termination of a franchise by the city and, in the case of the franchisee’s breach, may result in ineligibility for further city agreements; provided, that nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any subscriber coming within such classification would be entitled; and provided further, that connection and/or service charges may be waived or modified during promotional campaigns of a franchisee. [Ord. 156 § M25, 1998]

It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving cable service so long as their financial and other obligations to a franchisee are fulfilled. In this regard a franchisee shall act so far as it is within its control to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service during the term of the franchise, subject to applicable law.

In the event a franchisee fails to operate a cable television system for 72 continuous and consecutive hours without prior notification to and approval of the city council or without just cause such as an impossibility to operate the cable television system because of the occurrence of an emergency or other circumstances reasonably beyond a franchisee’s control, the city may, after notice and an opportunity for a franchisee to commence operations, at its option, operate the cable television system or designate someone to operate the cable television system until such time as a franchisee restores cable service to conditions acceptable to the city or a replacement franchisee is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for a franchisee, a franchisee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the cable television system received by the city that are the result of a franchisee’s failure to perform. [Ord. 156 § M26, 1998]


5.20.270 Transfer of ownership.

A franchise shall not be sold, transferred, leased, assigned, or disposed of in whole or in part either by sale, voluntary or involuntary merger, consolidation or otherwise, unless written approval is granted by the city council to ensure a review of unforeseen circumstances not present at the time of the original franchise. The city’s approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such costs associated with this review process shall be reimbursed to the city by a new prospective franchisee. This proceeding shall be in conformance with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Regulation 394, Application for Franchise Authority Consent to Assignment or Transfer of Control of Cable Television Franchise, which will govern the rights of the parties and establish time limitations for responses.

An assignment of a franchise shall be deemed to occur if there is an actual change in control or where ownership of 50 percent or more of the interests, singly or collectively, are obtained by other parties. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership only, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.

A franchisee shall promptly notify the city prior to any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, the control of the franchisee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of a franchisee shall cause a review of the proposed transfer. In the event that the city adopts a resolution denying its consent and such change, transfer or acquisition of control has been effected, the city may cancel the franchise. Approval shall not be required for mortgaging purposes or if said transfer is from a franchisee to another person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a franchisee.

If, in accordance with FCC 394 guidelines, the city adopts a resolution denying its consent, such changes, transfers or acquisition of control shall be deemed not to have been consummated. A franchisee may take such legally allowable actions following such refusal to accept such transfer.

The city shall be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with its review of a franchisee’s request. Such costs will not exceed in constant dollars those incurred during the original franchising or refranchising process. [Ord. 156 § M27, 1998]


5.20.280 Removal and abandonment of property of franchisee.

In the event that the use of any part of the cable television system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such system or property has been installed in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of the franchise or other city ordinances or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or has expired, upon receiving 10 business day’s prior written demand from the city, a franchisee shall promptly remove, at its expense, all such property and poles of such system, other than any which the city may permit to be abandoned in place, from the streets or public places. Said removal shall be completed within 180 days from receipt of the city’s written demand. In the event of such removal, a franchisee shall promptly restore the street or other areas from which such property has been removed to a condition satisfactory to the city.

Any property of a franchisee remaining in place 180 days after the termination or expiration of the franchise shall be considered permanently abandoned. The city may extend such time not to exceed an additional 90 days.

Any property of a franchisee to be abandoned in place 180 days shall be abandoned in such manner as the city shall prescribe. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of a franchisee in place, the property shall become that of the city, and a franchisee shall submit to the city clerk an instrument in writing, to be approved by the city attorney, transferring to the city the ownership of such property. None of the foregoing affects or limits franchisee’s rights to compensation for an involuntary abandonment of its property under state or federal law. [Ord. 156 § M28, 1998]


5.20.290 Revocation for cause.

Any franchise granted by the city may be terminated during the period of such franchise for failure by a franchisee to comply with material provisions of this chapter and/or the franchise subject to the provisions of this chapter, the franchise and other applicable law.

The following procedures shall be followed in determining whether to terminate a franchise under this section:

A.  The city council shall provide franchisee with a detailed written notice, by certified mail, stating the nature of any alleged noncompliance. Within 30 days thereafter, franchisee shall respond demonstrating that no violation occurred, that any problem has been corrected, or with a proposal to correct the problem within a specified period of time.

B. If said response is not satisfactory to the city or if the franchisee timely requests a hearing on the matter of the alleged noncompliance, the city shall cause the matter of noncompliance to be brought before the city council for a hearing within 60 days after city’s receipt of the franchisee’s response or request therefor.

C. At such a hearing a franchisee and other interested parties shall be given fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence, to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. The city council, or its designee, acting as hearings officer will make the determination as to whether any noncompliance or deficiency was without just cause. In the event the city council finds that such noncompliance or deficiency was without just cause, the city council may, in its sole discretion, fix an additional time period to cure violations. If the deficiency has not been cured at the expiration of any additional time period or if the council does not grant any additional period, the city council may by ordinance declare the franchise to be terminated and forfeited. Within 20 days after the hearing, the city council, on the basis of the record, will make the determination as to whether there is cause for termination and whether the franchise will be terminated.

D. If a franchisee appeals revocation and termination, such revocation may be held in abeyance pending judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided a franchisee is otherwise in compliance with the franchise.

E. Nothing contained in the above subsections of this section shall prevent the issuance of a new franchise containing terms substantially the same or identical to a franchise which previously was revoked, upon satisfactory assurances made to the city that the terms and conditions of this chapter can be met by the new franchisee. [Ord. 156 § M29, 1998]


5.20.300 Effect of termination for noncompliance.

Subject to state and federal law, if any franchise is terminated by the city by reason of a franchisee’s noncompliance, that part of the cable television system under such franchise located in the streets and public rights-of-way shall, at the election of the city, become the property of the city at a cost consistent with the provisions of the Act. If the city, or a third party, does not purchase the system, a franchisee shall, upon order of the city council, remove the cable television system as required under SMC 5.20.280, Removal and abandonment of property of franchisee. [Ord. 156 § M30, 1998]


5.20.310 Indemnity and hold harmless.

A franchisee will indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers, employees, contractors, and duly authorized agents or any person under its direction or control from any and all liabilities, fees, costs and damages, except in the case of judicially determined negligence and/or willful misconduct of the city, whether to person or property, or expense of any type or nature which may occur to the city by reason of the construction, operation, maintenance, repair and alteration of a franchisee’s facilities or any other actions of a franchisee in the city of Shoreline. In any case in which suit or action is instituted against the city by reason of damage or injury caused by a franchisee, the city shall cause written notice thereof to be given to a franchisee and a franchisee thereupon shall have the duty to appear and defend any such suit or action, without cost or expense to the city.

Notwithstanding the above, the city agrees to defend, indemnify, save and hold harmless the franchisee, its directors, officers, shareholders, and employees against any and all claims, costs and liability for damages, injury or death arising from or connected with the city’s use of the franchisee’s cable television system due to or claimed to be due to or alleged to be due to negligent or wrongful acts, errors or omissions of the city, its officers, employees, contractors, duly authorized agents or any person under its direction or control, save and except claims or litigations arising through the franchisee’s negligence or willful misconduct, and will defend any such suits at the cost and expense of the city, and failing to do so will make good to and reimburse the franchisee for any expenditures, including reasonable attorney’s fees, the franchisee may make by reason of such matters. As used in this section, the term “use” shall refer only to physical use of the franchisee’s cable television system, such as cablecasting of PEG programming, the use of franchisee poles and aerial and underground structures and the activation of the emergency alert override. [Ord. 156 § M31, 1998]


5.20.320 Insurance.

A franchisee agrees to maintain and shall furnish the city with a certified copy or original of a comprehensive liability insurance policy naming the city as an additional insured. The amount of such policy shall be as deemed appropriate by the city. Such insurance must be in place no later than the date of acceptance of a franchise by a franchisee. This insurance shall be maintained in full force at the franchisee’s expense throughout the period of the franchise. The city may delineate more specific details concerning such insurance prior to the award of a given franchise. [Ord. 156 § M32, 1998]


5.20.330 Performance bond.

A franchisee shall promptly repair or cause to be repaired any damage to city property caused by a franchisee or any agent of a franchisee. A franchisee shall comply with all present and future ordinances and regulations regarding excavation or construction and, if deemed necessary by the city, shall be required to post a performance bond or other surety acceptable to the city in an amount specified by the city in favor of the city warranting that all restoration work will be done promptly and in a workmanlike manner and that penalties, if any, after final adjudication are paid to the city within 90 days of such finding are payable to the city. [Ord. 156 § M33, 1998]


5.20.340 Recourse against bonds and other security.

Bonds and other security may be utilized by the city for the following purposes, including, but not limited to, reimbursement of the city by reason of a franchisee’s failure to pay the city any sums due under the terms of this chapter or the franchise, reimbursement of the city for reasonable costs borne by the city to correct franchise violations not corrected by a franchisee after due notice, and monetary remedies or damages assessed against a franchisee due to default or violations of the franchise requirements or this chapter.

A. Recourse.  In the event franchisee has been declared to be in default by the city under SMC 5.20.290, Revocation for cause, and if a franchisee fails, within 30 days of mailing of the city’s finding, to pay the city any franchise fee, penalties, or monetary sanctions, or fails to perform any of the conditions of the franchise, the city may thereafter foreclose against the performance bond and/or withdraw from any other security an amount sufficient to compensate the city’s damages, with interest at the legal rate. Upon such foreclosure or withdrawal, the city shall notify a franchisee in writing, by certified mail, postage prepaid, of the amount and date thereof.

B. Restoration. Within 30 days after mailing notice to a franchisee that the city has foreclosed franchisee’s performance bond or that any amount has been withdrawn by the city from the other security pursuant to subsection A of this section, a franchisee shall deposit such further bond or sum of money, or other security, as the city may require, sufficient to meet the requirements of this chapter.

C. Rights of the City. The rights reserved to the city with respect to any bond or security are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to any bond or other security shall constitute an election or waiver of any rights or other remedies the city may have. [Ord. 156 § M34, 1998]


5.20.350 Equalization of civic contributions.

In the event of one or more franchises being granted, the city may require that such subsequent franchisees pay to the city an amount proportionally equal to costs contributed by the original franchisee. These costs may include but are not limited to such features as access and institutional network costs, bi-directional or equivalent cable installed to municipal buildings and similar expenses.

On the anniversary of the grant of each later awarded franchise, such subsequent franchisees shall pay to the city an amount proportional to the amount contributed by the original franchisee, based upon the number of subscribers held by such subsequent franchisees. Such payments will be based upon incremental increases in subscribers, if any.

 

Additional franchisees shall provide all PEG access channel(s) currently available to the subscribers of existing franchisees. In order to provide these access channels, additional franchisees shall interconnect, at their cost, with existing franchisees, subject to any reasonable terms and conditions that the existing franchisee providing the interconnection may require. These interconnection agreements shall be made directly between the franchisees. The city council, in such cases of dispute of award, may be called upon to arbitrate regarding these arrangements. [Ord. 156 § M35, 1998]


5.20.360 Inconsistency.

If any portion of this chapter should be inconsistent or conflict with any rule or regulation now or hereafter adopted by the FCC or other federal or state law, then to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict, the rule or regulation of the FCC or other federal law shall control for so long, but only for so long, as such rule, regulation, or law shall remain in effect; provided the remaining provisions of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. [Ord. 156 § M36, 1998]


5.20.370 Severability.

If any section, subsection, clause or phrase of this chapter should be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter. [Ord. 156 § M37, 1998]


5.20.380 Effect of change in law.

In the event that state or federal laws, rules or regulations pre-empt a provision or limit the enforceability of a provision of this chapter, then the provision shall be read to be pre-empted to the extent and for the time, but only to the extent and for the time, required by law. In the event such state or federal law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended, voided or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof that had been pre-empted is no longer pre-empted, such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the parties hereto, without the requirement of further action on the part of either party. [Ord. 156 § M38, 1998]


5.20.390 Independent contractors.

This chapter shall not be construed to provide that a franchisee is the agent or legal representative of the city for any purpose whatsoever. The franchisee is not granted any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of or in the name of the city or to bind the city in any manner or thing whatsoever. [Ord. 156 § M39, 1998]


5.20.400 Applicability.

The ordinance codified in this chapter, including the franchise cable ordinance, Ordinance No. 83 and exhibits that are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference represents all of the covenants, promises, agreements, and conditions, both oral and written, between the parties.

5.20.420 Force majeure.

Prevention or delay of any performance by a franchisee under this chapter or a franchise due to circumstances beyond a franchisee’s control or acts of God shall not be deemed noncompliance or a violation of this chapter of a franchise. [Ord. 156 § M42, 1998]

B. The provisions of this code shall apply to any offense committed on or after 12:01 a.m. on February 28, 1996.

C. The provisions of this code do not apply to or govern the construction of and punishment for any offense committed prior to 12:01 a.m. on February 28, 1996, or to the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. Such an offense must be construed and punished according to the provisions of law existing in the city at the time of the commission thereof in the same manner as if this code had not been enacted.

D. The sections of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the King County Code (KCC), now in effect or as subsequently amended, specifically enumerated in this chapter, are adopted by reference in this code.

E. Section captions are for organizational purposes only and shall not be construed as part of this code. [Ord. 73 § 1, 1996]


9.10.020 Purposes – Principles of construction.

A. The general purposes of the provisions governing the definition of offenses are:

1. To forbid and prevent conduct that inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests;

2. To safeguard conduct that is without culpability from condemnation as criminal;

3. To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense; and

4. To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses, and to prescribe proportionate penalties for each.

B. The provisions of this code shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms, and when the language is susceptible of differing constructions, it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this code.

C. In adopting state statutes by reference, only those crimes and offenses within the jurisdiction of a municipality are intended to be adopted and, in those sections adopted which define both misdemeanors and felonies, only the language applicable to misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors is to be applied. [Ord. 73 § 2, 1996]


9.10.030 City criminal jurisdiction.

Any person who commits any offense defined by this code, in whole or in part, within the corporate limits of the city is liable to arrest, prosecution and punishment. [Ord. 73 § 3, 1996]


9.10.040 Classes of crimes.

An offense defined by this code, for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized, constitutes a violation of city ordinance and a crime. Crimes are classified as gross misdemeanors or misdemeanors. [Ord. 73 § 4, 1996]


9.10.050 Punishment – Restitution.

A. Unless specifically provided otherwise, every person convicted of a gross misdemeanor shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term of not more than one year, or by a fine in an amount of not more than $5,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine.

B. Unless specifically provided otherwise, every person convicted of a misdemeanor, or a crime not otherwise classified, shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term of not more than 90 days, or by a fine in an amount of not more than $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine.

C. A person who is convicted of a misdemeanor violation of any provision of Chapter 69.50 RCW adopted by reference shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than 24 consecutive hours, and by a fine of not less than $250.00. On a second or subsequent conviction, the fine shall not be less than $500.00. These fines shall be in addition to any other fine or penalty imposed. Unless the court finds that the imposition of the minimum imprisonment will pose a substantial risk to the defendant’s physical or mental well-being or that local jail facilities are in an overcrowded condition, the term of imprisonment shall not be suspended or deferred. If the court finds such risk or overcrowding exists, it shall sentence the defendant to a minimum of 40 hours of community service. If a minimum term of imprisonment is suspended or deferred, the court shall state in writing the reason for granting the suspension or deferral and the facts upon which the suspension or deferral is based. Unless the court finds the person to be indigent, the minimum fine shall not be suspended or deferred.

D. The court may impose restitution as provided in RCW 9A.20.030.

E. In the event there is a conflict in the penalties which can be imposed upon conviction for a specific offense between the provisions of the Shoreline criminal code and the Revised Code of Washington, the penalty provisions of the Revised Code of Washington shall apply.

B. Periods of limitation toll for any period of time the person charged is not usually and publicly resident within this state.

C. If a complaint or an information filed before the end of a period of limitation is thereafter set aside, then the period is extended by a period equal to the length of time from the filing to the setting aside. [Ord. 557 § 4, 2009; Ord. 73 § 6, 1996]


9.10.070 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

A. Every person charged with an offense is presumed innocent unless proven guilty by competent evidence establishing each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

9.10.285 Stay out of drug areas.

A. Purpose. A court may issue an order prohibiting a person from entering or remaining in a designated “stay out of drug area” (SODA). This prohibition is one means of addressing illegal drug activity; activity that the city finds is threatening the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Shoreline. By designating specific areas, public or private, within the city of Shoreline as a SODA, the city, in conjunction with the court, is working towards eliminating illegal drug possession, use, sales and other criminal activity associated with these activities.

B. Designation of Stay Out of Drug Areas.

1. Certain areas of the city are designated and identified as SODAs based on repeat, high-level incidents of narcotics-related activities occurring within the area. The perimeters of a SODA may be defined using street names or numbers and shall include all real property contained therein, where drug sales, possession of drugs, pedestrian or vehicular traffic attendant to drug activity, or other activity associated with drug offenses confirms a pattern associated with illegal drug trafficking and use. The area shall include the full width of streets, alleys, and sidewalks on the perimeter, common areas, planting strips, parks and parking areas within the area described using the streets as boundaries.

2. The following described areas are identified and designated as SODAs:

a. Aurora Avenue North from North 145th Street to North 205th Street, including one block east and west of Aurora Avenue;

b. Aurora Transit Center, located at 1524 North 200th Street;

c. Echo Lake City Park located at 1521 North 200th Street;

d. Interurban Trail corridor, located between North 145th Street and North 205th Street.

The boundaries of the designated SODAs identified by this section shall be shown and delineated on the Stay Out of Drug Area (SODA) map accompanying the ordinance codified in this section and hereby incorporated by reference. The SODA map shall be maintained as such and will be on file at City Hall.

3. Designated SODAs shall be reviewed every two years by the city attorney and the chief of police to ensure their continued effectiveness. Recommendations for de-designation or modification of an existing SODA or for the designation of a new SODA shall be subject to approval by the city council.

C. Issuance of SODA Order.

1. The city attorney, after consultation with the chief of police, may seek a SODA order from the court as a condition of pre-trial release or a condition of sentence, deferral, or suspension for any person.

2. A court may enter a SODA order prohibiting a person from entering or remaining in a designated SODA for up to one year. The SODA order shall be in writing and shall bear the following language:

Violation of this court order is a criminal offense under SMC 9.10.285 and shall constitute a separate criminal offense. Violators will be subject to arrest.

3. The court in its discretion may allow a person subject to a SODA order to enter a SODA under certain conditional exceptions. Exceptions to the SODA order may include travel to and from and/or remaining in the following locations so long as these locations apply to or are used by the person who is subject of the SODA order:

a. Place of residence;

b. Court/government offices (while open to the public);

c. Social services provider or treatment center;

d. Place of employment;

e. School;

f. Attorney’s office; or

g. Medical services.

If the court allows for exceptions in the SODA order, the person subject to that order is required to have a copy of the order on their person whenever they are traveling through a restricted designated SODA(s). Failure to present this order upon request by law enforcement is a violation of the SODA order and subject to the penalties set forth in this chapter. For the purpose of this section, “travel” is defined as movement on foot or in a vehicle from one point to another without delay.

4. Upon entering a SODA order, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order to the city of Shoreline police department on or before the next judicial day following issuance of the order. Upon receipt, the Shoreline police shall enter the order into the appropriate law enforcement information system, noting the expiration date of the SODA order.

D. Notice of SODA Order. A person is deemed to have notice of the SODA order when:

1. The signature of the person prohibited in the order is affixed to the bottom of the order, acknowledging receipt of the order; or

2. The order otherwise indicates that the person appeared before the court at the time order was entered.

E. Enforcement Procedure.

1. If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person subject to a SODA order is knowingly violating that order, such person may be apprehended and arrested without the necessity for any warrant or additional court order.

2. The chief of police, in consultation with the city attorney, shall have the authority to promulgate procedures for the administration of this chapter.

F. Penalties.

1. Any person who knowingly disobeys a SODA order shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

2. Any person who knowingly disobeys a SODA order may also be found in contempt of court. [Ord. 688 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014]

B. The obligation of complying with this chapter and liability for failing to do so is placed on the parties responsible for owning, operating, monitoring or maintaining alarm systems. [Ord. 612 § 1, 2011; Ord. 275 § 1, 2001]


9.20.010 Prohibited – Exception.

The installation or use of any electric, electronic or mechanical security device which gives automatic notice to the communications center of the sheriff’s office or fire department, is prohibited, except by federal, state or local government agencies acting with the permission of the police or fire chief. This provision specifically includes devices utilizing the public telephone system. [Ord. 612 § 1, 2011; Ord. 275 § 1, 2001]

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

A. “Alarm business” means the business by an individual, partnership, corporation or other entity of selling, leasing, maintaining, monitoring, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving or installing an alarm system or causing to be sold, leased, maintained, monitored, serviced, repaired, altered, replaced, moved or installed an alarm system in or on any building, structure or facility.

C. “Alarm monitoring company” means an individual, partnership, corporation or other form of association that engages in the business of monitoring property, burglary, robbery or panic alarms and reporting activation of the alarm system to a law enforcement agency.

D. “Alarm site” means a single premises or location served by an alarm system or systems. Each tenancy, if served by a separate alarm system in a multitenant building or complex, is a separate alarm site.

E. “Alarm system” means a system, device or mechanism that, when activated, transmits a telephone message to a private alarm monitoring company or some other number, emits an audible or visible signal that can be heard or seen by persons outside the protected premises or transmits a signal beyond the premises in some other fashion, to report a crime in progress or other crisis situation requiring a police or fire response. “Alarm system” does not include a medical alert system or an alarm installed on a motor vehicle.

An alarm is presumed false if the police officers responding do not locate evidence of an intrusion or commission of an unlawful act or emergency on the premises that might have caused the alarm to sound or if the responding fire officials do not locate any risk from fire, heat, water or smoke. However, “false alarm” does not include an alarm caused by extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm business operator or alarm user. An alarm dispatch request that is canceled by the alarm system monitoring company or the alarm system user before arrival of the responding officer or official to the alarm site is not a false alarm for the purposes of penalty assessment or no-response status designation.

H. “Monitoring” means the process by which an alarm business receives signals from the alarm system and relays an alarm dispatch request to the proper jurisdiction for the purpose of summoning police or fire response to the alarm site.

I. “No response” means that police officers may not be dispatched to investigate a report of an automatic burglary or property alarm system activation at an alarm site that has a record of four false alarms within a continuous six-month period, if the alarm is the only basis for making the dispatch.

J. “Premises” means an area or a portion of an area protected by an alarm system.

K. “Sheriff” means the sheriff of King County.

L. “Verification” means an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request by the alarm business, or its representative, by contacting the alarm site by telephonic or other electronic means, with or without actual contact with a system user or representative, before requesting a police or fire dispatch. [Ord. 612 § 1, 2011; Ord. 275 § 1, 2001]


9.20.030 Requirements.

A.    1. An alarm system may not have an alarm signal audible on the exterior of an alarm site that sounds longer than one hour after being activated.

3. If applicable, describe in plain language, other than a zone number, the specific location on the premises of the point of entry or unauthorized access. [Ord. 612 § 1, 2011; Ord. 275 § 1, 2001]


9.20.040 Excessive or improper false alarms – Penalties.

A. For a response to premises at which no other false alarm has occurred within any consecutive six-month period, no fee shall be charged. 

B. Any person or business, through error, omission or mechanical/electrical failure that causes two false alarms in any consecutive six-month period shall be assessed a civil penalty of $50.00. The penalty for the third and any successive false alarm in a six-month period is $75.00. Any succeeding false alarms as a result of failure to take the necessary corrective action or any nonpayment of any false alarm charges, or both, may result in the chief of police ordering the disconnection of the alarm until either the corrective action is taken or any outstanding charges are paid, or both, or ordering no response to future alarms. However, a disconnection may not be ordered as to any premises required by law to have an alarm system in operation.

C. Any alarm system business or monitoring company, through error, omission or mechanical/electrical failure, that violates SMC 9.20.030 shall be assessed a civil penalty of $100.00. [Ord. 612 § 1, 2011; Ord. 275 § 1, 2001]


9.20.050 No response to excessive false alarms.

A. After the third false alarm in a six-month consecutive period, the police chief shall send a notification to the alarm user and the alarm monitoring company, if any, by regular mail, that contains the following information:

2. The notice must include explanation that the approval of the police chief for reinstatement may only be obtained by applying in writing for the reinstatement. The police chief may reinstate the alarm user upon a finding that reasonable effort has been made to correct the false alarms, including documentation from an alarm business, stating that the alarm system is operating properly and that the alarm user’s agents are properly trained in the alarm system’s operation. The city and police chief are not responsible for costs incurred by the alarm system user to qualify for reinstatement.

C. The suspension of police response must begin 20 days after the notice of suspension or notice of no-response status was sent by first class mail to the alarm user unless a written request for an appeal hearing has been filed in the required time period under this chapter. [Ord. 612 § 1, 2011; Ord. 275 § 1, 2001. Formerly 9.20.055]

This may include structures, facilities, and uses that involve capital expenditures. 

1. If the use is allowed in the adjacent zoning designation, a right-of-way site permit may be issued for:

c. Bus shelters/stops;

Each permit shall be of the duration specified on the permit and may be renewed for up to the length of the original permit, at the discretion of the director.

6. Upon termination of a site permit, for which the permittee does not obtain a new permit, any improvements constructed in the right-of-way must be removed by the permittee and the area restored to its original condition or better.

D. Right-of-Way Use Permits. The purpose of use permits is to allow short-term activities and temporary alteration of the right-of-way so as not to unreasonably obstruct, hinder, jeopardize, injure, or delay the use of the right-of-way for its primary functions: vehicular and pedestrian travel. All use of the right-of-way shall be for a lawful purpose and shall not breach the peace or adversely interfere with public use of the right-of-way. The location, time, and date of the use must be in accordance with city requirements. All signs for directional control and event advertising must be approved, properly erected, and removed within 24 hours of the termination of the use. The permittee shall be liable for any expense, damages, or cost required to return the right-of-way to its condition prior to use by the permittee or to an improved condition if specifically required by the conditions of the permit. The permittee may be required to advise property owners who may be inconvenienced during the right-of-way usage. Police escorts, control, and inspections may be required. All floats, stands, and use-related structures shall be subject to fire and building code requirements. Other conditions may be imposed at the discretion of the director.

12.15.130 Temporary street closures.

The convenience of an open roadway is consistent with the idea of good customer service. The city will discourage street closures and strongly discourage arterial street closures. In the event of street closure, the following standards apply except when a right-of-way permit issued pursuant to this chapter provides otherwise:

A. Signs notifying the public of the upcoming closure shall be posted in a conspicuous place at each end of the roadway to be closed and at all intersections associated and/or adjacent to the closed segment of the street.

B. The signs shall be posted no later than three calendar days prior to the proposed closure unless a different time period is required by the right-of-way permit.

C. Any residential street closures greater than 12 consecutive hours will require a detour route plan, signage, and a public notice published in the newspaper of record a minimum of three calendar days prior to closure.

D. For all nonemergency arterial street closures, in addition to posting signs, public notice published in the newspaper of record is required a minimum of three calendar days prior to the closure, regardless of the length of the closure.

E. For all street closures described above, the permittee is required to notify in writing the following agencies a minimum of three calendar days prior to the closure:

1. The Shoreline police department;

2. The Shoreline fire district;

3. The Shoreline school district; and

4. King County transportation division.

F. These standards shall be considered a minimum; other notifications may be required as deemed appropriate by the director. [Ord. 813 § 1, 2018; Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.140 Purpose.

The purpose of SMC 12.15.140 through 12.15.180 is to provide the requirements and conditions regarding the accommodation of utilities in the city right-of-way. The accommodation of utilities in city right-of-way shall place primary emphasis on the following:

A. Transportation operation and safety;

B. Maintaining the structural integrity of the transportation facility;

C. Preserving the aesthetic value of the facility elements;

D. Protecting the public’s investment in the roadway and associated facilities; 

E. Accommodating development or improvement of the city right-of-way;

F. Minimizing the need for later adjustment to accommodate future roadway improvements; and

G. Permitting service access to utility installations with minimum interference to traffic. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.150 Utilities in good standing.

The purpose of designating utilities in good standing (UGS) is to provide a streamlined permitting process by issuing UGS certification for franchised utilities. This certification will allow a UGS utility to work in the right-of-way without a permit for blanket activity work. The UGS utility may inspect its own blanket activity work and certify that the work has occurred in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Each utility may apply for UGS certification in writing on the standard city form.

A. Approval Standards. All franchise holders are eligible to apply for UGS certification. To qualify for UGS certification, the following factors shall be considered:

1. A utility must have no more than three written notifications of noncompliance during the preceding 12 months;

2. The utility’s past documented performance in complying with city policy and requirements;

3. Terms of the utility’s franchise agreement.

Records of the actions by the utilities providing timely relocation and extension, and work that conforms to the standards of this chapter will be kept by the department and will be used as a basis for establishing or continuing UGS standing.

B. Revocation of UGS Standing. Utility in good standing certification shall remain in effect for the term of the franchise agreement, or until the UGS certification is revoked. Revocation may occur for the following reasons:

1. A UGS utility may have its UGS certification immediately revoked upon written notice by the director for gross noncompliance with city requirements creating health, safety, or roadway stability hazards.

2. A UGS certification may be automatically revoked after three written notifications of noncompliance within a 12-month period. Reasons for notifications of noncompliance may include, but not be limited to, the following list. Failure to:

a. Comply with the provisions of the franchise agreement;

b. Comply with the Shoreline development code and engineering development guide;

c. Comply with the latest edition of the MUTCD;

d. Comply with Washington State Labor and Industry rules;

e. Comply with the provisions and conditions on an approved permit;

f. Actively coordinate with city street construction projects, including attending any required design and preconstruction meetings;

g. Actively coordinate with other utilities on utility-initiated projects;

h. Respond to requests for relocation information when requested by the city;

i. Relocate utility franchises in a timely manner that is consistent with approved construction schedules;

j. Notify the city as soon as it is known that compliance with city standards for a construction project cannot be achieved (an engineering standards variance may be required);

k. Obtain a permit, when required, to work in the right-of-way;

l. Notify the city 24 to 72 hours prior to beginning work in the right-of-way;

m. Notify the appropriate agencies prior to a road closure;

n. Notify the city of canceled or completed work in a timely manner;

o. Complete all work within 12 months of permit issuance;

p. Permanently repair a pavement patch within 30 calendar days from the date of temporary restoration;

q. Restore the roadway and pavement in accordance with approved provisions and conditions;

r. Leave the project site in a manner that is safe and protected;

s. Minimize the need for cutting of pavement less than 60 months old;

t. Maintain temporary pavement restorations;



u. Remove abandoned aboveground facilities in the required timeframes; and

v. Payment of permit fees in a timely manner.

C. The director shall consider the following before issuing a written letter of noncompliance:

1. The utility’s tenure;

2. Prior performance levels;

3. Volume of work conducted;

4. Severity of the noncompliance; and

5. The existence of extreme circumstances beyond the utility’s control. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.160 Design of utility installations.

The utility is responsible for the design of the utility facility being proposed. This design, in addition to the integrity of the proposed utility facility, shall include provisions for public safety during the course of construction as well as full consideration of traffic safety and traffic accident potential for the life of the installation. The design shall also minimize disturbance to the roadway both during and after construction. In the case of proposed attachment to existing bridges and structures, the utility is responsible for submitting engineering information, including all engineering calculations, to the director concerning the structural ability of the bridge to carry the additional load. The director will make a final determination regarding the request and establish design and construction parameters for this type of work. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.170 Utility installation.

The department shall determine whether proposed utility construction is consistent with the applicant’s right-of-way franchise or permit from the city. Applications shall be evaluated in respect to the hazard and risk of the proposed construction, location of the proposed construction in relation to other utilities in the right-of-way and the adequacy of the engineering and design of proposed construction. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.180 Types of utility activities.

Depending on the type of work and the standing of the utility, a permit may be required for a utility to work in the right-of-way. In the event of conflict between the listed standards and a utility’s franchise agreement or right-of-way use agreement, the provisions of the agreement shall apply. Utility work is divided into the following three classifications:

A. Minor Activity.

1. Minor activity work does not disrupt right-of-way or traffic patterns. Some examples of minor activity work include:

a. Street lamp replacement;

b. Accessing existing manholes and vaults;

c. Raising valves;

d. Providing cathodic protection; and

e. Replacing existing aboveground meters, transformers, closures, and pedestals.

2. No breaking of any asphalt, curb, gutter, or sidewalk is allowed. No permit or notification is required for this type of work; however, proper traffic control devices must be used and any disturbance to the right-of-way must be repaired in accordance with standards. 

B. Blanket Activity.

1. Blanket activity work has a moderate effect on nonarterial right-of-way or traffic patterns. Some examples of blanket activity work include:

a. Installing utility services while disturbing no more pavement than the specified maximum amount in each utility blanket agreement;

b. Installing short side services and hydrants;

c. Pushing under a street; and

d. Constructing splice pits.

2. Utilities in good standing are not required to obtain a permit for these types of activities; however, fax notification must be provided to the city 24 to 72 hours before starting any blanket activity work. Utilities not in good standing must obtain a permit prior to starting any blanket activity work.

C. Major Activity.

1. Major activity work has a major impact on the right-of-way or traffic patterns. Some examples of major activity work include:

a. Cutting asphalt greater than the square footage allowed as specified in a blanket activity permit.

b. Constructing a main line or an open cut road crossing.

2. All utilities are required to obtain a permit for this type of work. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.190 Revocation of permits.

A. The director may revoke any permit issued under this chapter whenever in the director’s sole determination:

1. The work or activity does not proceed in accordance with the plans as approved, or conditions of approval, or is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or procedures, or other city ordinances, state law or federal law;

2. The city has been denied access to investigate and perform inspection;

3. The permittee has made a misrepresentation of a material fact in applying for a permit;

4. The progress or condition of the approved work or activity indicates that it is or will be inadequate to protect the public and adjoining property, the street or utilities in the street, or any excavation or fill endangers or will endanger the public, the adjoining property, street or utilities in the street.

B. Upon suspension or revocation of a permit, all use of the right-of-way shall cease, except as authorized or directed by the director. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.200 Nuisance in the right-of-way.

Any activity, object or thing which occupies any right-of-way without the legal authorization required by this chapter is declared a public nuisance and shall be subject to enforcement procedures, including penalties, as provided in Chapter 20.30 SMC. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]


12.15.210 Adoption of administrative procedures.

The director may prepare and adopt policies and procedures necessary to implement this chapter. Such policies do not require approval by the city council. [Ord. 339 § 1, 2003]

[Ord. 244 § 1, 2000; Ord. 83 § 8, 1996]


12.25.090 Franchise fee.

A. All franchise agreements executed by the city shall include terms requiring a grantee to pay a fee in consideration of the privilege granted under a franchise agreement to use the public right-of-way and the privilege to construct and/or operate in the city. Said franchise fee shall provide the city with compensation equal to six percent of the gross revenues generated by the grantee within the city unless limited by state or federal law; provided, however, that this fee may be offset by any utility tax paid by grantee or in-kind facilities or services provided to the city. Any grantee that does not provide revenue-generating services within the city shall provide alternate compensation as set out in the franchise agreement.

B. In the event that any franchise payment is not received by the city on or before the applicable due date, interest shall be charged from such date at the statutory rate for judgments.

C. In the event a franchise is revoked or otherwise terminated prior to its expiration date, a grantee shall file with the city, within 90 days of the date of revocation or termination, a verified or, if available, an audited financial statement showing the gross revenues received by the grantee since the end of the previous year and shall make adjustments at that time for the franchise fees due up to the date of revocation or termination.

D. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the city’s authority to tax a grantee, or to collect any fee or charge permitted by law, and no immunity from any such obligations shall attach to a grantee by virtue of this chapter. [Ord. 244 § 1, 2000; Ord. 221 § 1, 1999; Ord. 83 § 9, 1996]


12.25.100 Franchise agreement revocation.

A. In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city under this chapter and any franchise agreement issued pursuant thereto, the city council reserves the right to revoke and terminate a franchise agreement and all rights and privileges of a grantee in the event of a substantial violation or breach of its terms and conditions. A substantial violation or breach by a grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

1. An uncured violation of any material provision of this chapter or an uncured breach of any material provision of a franchise agreement or other agreement issued thereunder, or any material rule, order or regulation of the city made pursuant to its power to protect the public health, safety and welfare;

2. An intentional evasion or knowing attempt to evade any material provision of a franchise agreement or practice of any fraud or deceit upon the system customers or upon the city;

3. Failure to begin or substantially complete any system construction or system extension as set forth in a franchise agreement;

4. Failure to provide the services promised in the application or specified in a franchise agreement, or a reasonable substitute therefor;

5. Failure to restore service after 10 consecutive days of interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from the city;

6. Misrepresentation of material fact in the application for, or during negotiations relating to, a franchise agreement;

7. A continuous and willful pattern of grossly inadequate service and failure to respond to legitimate customer complaints;

8. An uncured failure to pay franchise agreement fees as required by the franchise agreement.

B. None of the foregoing shall constitute a substantial violation or breach if a violation or breach occurs which is without fault of a grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond a grantee’s reasonable control. A grantee shall not be excused by economic hardship nor by nonfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers, agents or employees; provided, however, that damage to equipment causing service interruption shall be deemed to be the result of circumstances beyond a grantee’s control if it is caused by any negligent act or unintended omission of its employees (assuming proper training) or agents (assuming reasonable diligence in their selection), or sabotage or vandalism or malicious mischief by its employees or agents. A grantee shall bear the burden of proof in establishing the existence of such conditions.

C. Except in the case of termination pursuant to subsection (A)(5) of this section, prior to any termination or revocation, the city shall provide a grantee with detailed written notice of any substantial violation or material breach upon which it proposes to take action. A grantee shall have a period of 60 days following such written notice to cure the alleged violation or breach, demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction that a violation or breach does not exist, or submit a plan satisfactory to the city to correct the violation or breach. If at the end of said 60-day period the city reasonably believes that a substantial violation or material breach is continuing and a grantee is not taking satisfactory corrective action, the city may declare a grantee in default, which declaration must be in writing. Within 20 days after receipt of a written declaration of default from the city, a grantee may request, in writing, a hearing before a “hearing examiner” as described in Chapter 2.15 SMC. The hearing examiner shall conduct a full public proceeding in accordance with applicable procedures. The hearing examiner’s decision may be appealed to any court of competent jurisdiction.

The city may, in its discretion, provide an additional opportunity for a grantee to remedy any violation or breach and come into compliance with this chapter so as to avoid the termination or revocation. [Ord. 244 § 1, 2000; Ord. 83 § 11, 1996. Formerly 12.25.110]


12.25.110 Enforcement.

Any violation of any provision, or failure to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter, shall be a civil violation subjecting the offender to a civil penalty of up to $100.00 for each of the first five days that a violation exists and up to $500.00 for each subsequent day that a violation exists. Notice and order and hearing procedures, other than civil penalties, shall correspond to those established for the enforcement of Development Code violations under SMC Title 20. Payment of any such monetary penalty shall not relieve any person of the duty to correct the violation as set forth in the applicable notice and order. Any violation existing for a period greater than 30 days may be remedied by the city at the violator’s expense. [Ord. 244 § 1, 2000; Ord. 83 § 12, 1996. Formerly 12.25.120]


12.25.120 Federal pre-emption.

13.12.100 General.

A. Findings of Fact.

1. The city of Shoreline has areas that are subject to periodic inundation and channel migration which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for protection and relief from flooding and channel migration, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

2. When floodplains and watersheds are developed without appropriate care and precautions, flood heights, frequencies, and velocities increase, increasing threat to humans, damage to property, destruction of natural floodplain functions, and adverse impacts to water quality and habitat.

3. Rivers, streams, lakes, estuarine and marine areas, and their floodplains are major elements of healthy aquatic and riparian habitats and conveyance of floodwaters. If watersheds, rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, floodplains, and other systems are not viewed holistically as biological and geomorphologic units, serious degradation of habitat and increased flood hazards to people and human development can increase.

4. Over the years, natural processes have evolved that manage floodwaters and channel flows in the most effective and efficient manner. Disruption of these processes by altering land cover, stream channels, wetlands, and other water bodies leads to increased flood hazards, loss of life and property, threats to public health, and loss of habitat.

B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by managing development in order to:

1. Protect human life, health and property from the dangers of flooding;

2. Minimize the need for publicly funded and hazardous rescue efforts to save those who are isolated by floodwaters;

3. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood damage repair and flood control projects;

4. Minimize disruption of commerce and governmental services;

5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in the floodplain;

6. Maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use of flood prone areas to minimize future flood blight areas;

7. Encourage those who occupy areas subject to flooding and channel migration to assume responsibility for their actions;

8. Qualify the city for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, thereby giving citizens and businesses the opportunity to purchase flood insurance;

9. Maintain the quality of water in rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, and marine areas and their floodplains so as to protect public water supplies, areas of the public trust, and wildlife habitat protected by the Endangered Species Act;

10. Retain the natural channel, shoreline, and floodplain creation processes and other natural floodplain functions that protect, create, and maintain habitat for threatened and endangered species;

11. Prevent or minimize loss of hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological functions of floodplains and stream channels.

C. Applicability. This chapter shall apply to the regulatory floodplain, which is comprised of the special flood hazard area and all protected areas within the jurisdiction of the city of Shoreline as defined in SMC 13.12.105. [Ord. 641 § 7 (Exh. A), 2012]


13.12.105 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, terms or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

“Adversely affect” or “adverse effect” means an effect that is a direct or indirect result of the proposed action or its interrelated or interdependent actions and the effects are not discountable, insignificant or beneficial. A discountable effect is extremely unlikely to occur. An insignificant effect relates to the size of the impact and should never reach the scale where a take occurs. Based on best judgment, a person would not: (A) be able to meaningfully measure, detect, or evaluate an insignificant effect; or (B) expect a discountable effect to occur.

“Appurtenant structure” means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.

“New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.

“NMFS” means National Marine Fisheries Service.

“Protected area” means the lands that lie within the boundaries of the floodway, the riparian habitat zone, and the channel migration area. Because of the impact that development can have on flood heights and velocities and habitat, special rules apply in the protected area.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle:

A. Built on a single chassis; and

B. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; and

C. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by an automobile or light duty truck; and

“Regulatory floodplain” means the area of the special flood hazard area plus the protected area, as defined in SMC 13.12.300. The term also includes newly designated areas that are delineated pursuant to SMC 13.12.300(E).

“Riparian” means of, adjacent to, or living on the bank of a river, lake, pond, ocean, sound, or other water body.

“Riparian habitat zone” means the water body and adjacent land areas that are likely to support aquatic and riparian habitat as detailed in SMC 13.12.300(D)(2).

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means the land subject to inundation by the base flood. Special flood hazard areas are designated on flood insurance rate maps with the letter “A” or “V” including AE, AO, AH, A1-99 and VE. The special flood hazard area is also referred to as the area of special flood hazard or SFHA.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial damage” also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

A. Before the “start of construction” of the improvement; or

B. Before damage occurred, if the structure has been damaged or is being restored.

Substantial improvement occurs with the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects external dimensions.

Substantial improvement includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed.

Substantial improvement does not include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

“Variance (floodplain)” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

7. Where elevation data are not available either through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc. Failure to elevate at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

D. Protected Area. The protected area is comprised of those lands that lie within the boundaries of the floodway, the riparian habitat zone, and the channel migration area.

1. In riverine areas, where a floodway has not been designated in accordance with subsection (C)(5), (C)(6), or (E)(5) of this section, the protected area is comprised of those lands that lie within the boundaries of the riparian habitat zone, the channel migration area, and the SFHA.

2. The riparian habitat zone includes those watercourses within the SFHA and adjacent land areas that are likely to support aquatic and riparian habitat. The size and location of the riparian habitat zone is dependent on the type of water body. The riparian habitat zone includes the water body and adjacent lands, measured perpendicularly from ordinary high water on both sides of the water body:

a. Type S – Streams that are designated “shorelines of the state”: 250 feet.

b. Type F – Fish-bearing streams greater than five feet wide and marine shorelines: 200 feet.

c. Type F – Streams less than five feet wide and lakes: 150 feet.

d. Type N – Non-salmonid-bearing perennial and seasonal streams with unstable slopes: 225 feet.

e. All other Type N – Non-salmonid-bearing perennial and seasonal streams: 150 feet.

b. Where a channel migration zone has not yet been mapped, the provisions of subsection (E)(6) of this section shall apply at the time of permit application.

c. Where more than one channel migration zone has been delineated, the director shall use the delineation that has been adopted for other local regulatory purposes.

E. New Regulatory Data.

1. All requests to revise or change the flood hazard data, including requests for a letter of map revision and a conditional letter of map revision, shall be reviewed by the director.

a. The director shall not sign the community acknowledgment form for any requests based on filling or other development, unless the applicant for the letter documents that such filling or development complies with this chapter.

b. The director shall not approve a request to revise or change a floodway delineation until FEMA has issued a conditional letter of map revision that approves the change.

2. The director shall use the most restrictive data available for the channel migration zone, floodways, future conditions, and riparian habitat areas.

3. If an applicant disagrees with the regulatory data prescribed by this chapter, they may submit a detailed technical study needed to replace existing data with better data in accordance with FEMA mapping guidelines or Regional Guidance for Hydrologic and Hydraulic Studies in Support of the Model Ordinance for Floodplain Management and the Endangered Species Act, 2010, FEMA Region 10. If the data in question are shown on the published FIRM, the submittal must also include a request to FEMA for a conditional letter of map revision.

4. Where base flood elevation data are not available in accordance with subsection C of this section, applicants for approval of new subdivisions and other proposed developments, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is smaller, shall include such data with their permit applications.

5. Where floodway delineation is not available in accordance with subsection C of this section, the floodway will be designated to be one-half the distance of the mapped 100-year floodplain at any point, and the prohibition on floodway development applies, unless a floodway study indicates otherwise. This provision applies to any floodplain development permit, including those for substantial improvements.

6. Where channel migration zone data are not available in accordance with subsection (D)(3) of this section, the permit applicant shall either:

a. Designate the entire SFHA as the channel migration zone; or

b. Identify the channel migration area in accordance with Regional Guidance for Hydrologic and Hydraulic Studies in Support of the Model Ordinance for Floodplain Management and the Endangered Species Act, 2010, FEMA Region 10.

2. In riverine special flood hazard areas where a floodway has not been delineated pursuant to SMC 13.12.300(C)(5), (C)(6), or (E)(5), the applicant for a project to develop in the SFHA shall provide a certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed development and all other past or future similar developments would not cumulatively result in an increase of flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge by more than 0.01 feet.

D. Compensatory Storage. New development shall not reduce the effective flood storage volume of the regulatory floodplain. A development proposal shall provide compensatory storage if grading or other activity eliminates any effective flood storage volume. Compensatory storage shall:

1. Provide equivalent volume at equivalent elevations to that being displaced. For this purpose, “equivalent elevation” means having similar relationship to ordinary high water and to the best available 10-year, 50-year and 100-year water surface profiles;

2. Be hydraulically connected to the source of flooding; and

3. Provide compensatory storage in the same construction season as when the displacement of flood storage volume occurs and before the flood season begins.

4. The newly created storage area shall be graded and vegetated to allow fish access during flood events without creating fish stranding sites.

E. Alteration of Watercourses.

1. In addition to the other requirements in this section, an applicant for a project that will alter or relocate a watercourse shall also submit a request for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR), where required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The project will not be approved unless FEMA issues the CLOMR (which requires ESA consultation) and the provisions of the letter are made part of the permit requirements.

2. The director shall notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

3. Maintenance shall be provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. If the maintenance program does not call for cutting of native vegetation, the system shall be oversized at the time of construction to compensate for said vegetation growth or any other natural factor that may need future maintenance.

F. Habitat Impact Assessment. Unless allowed under SMC 13.12.700(B) and (C), a permit application to develop in the regulatory floodplain shall include an assessment of the impact of the project on federal, state or locally protected species and habitat, water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat. The assessment shall be performed by a qualified professional as defined by SMC 20.20.042 who is approved by the city or under contract to the city. The assessment shall be:

1. A biological evaluation or biological assessment developed per 50 CFR 402.12 to initiate federal interagency consultation under Endangered Species Act Section 7(a)(2); or

2. Documentation that the activity fits within Section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act; or

3. Documentation that the activity fits within a habitat conservation plan approved pursuant to Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act, where any such assessment has been prepared or is otherwise made available; or

4. An assessment prepared in accordance with Floodplain Habitat Assessment and Mitigation Draft Regional Guidance, 2011, FEMA Region 10. The assessment shall determine if the project would adversely affect:

a. Species that are federal, state, or local listed as threatened or endangered,

c. Essential fish habitat designated by the National Marine Fisheries Service,

d. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas,

e. Other protected areas and elements necessary for species conservation.

G. Habitat Mitigation Plan.

1. If the assessment conducted under subsection F of this section concludes the project is expected to have an adverse effect on water quality and/or aquatic or riparian habitat or habitat functions, the applicant shall provide a plan to mitigate those impacts, in accordance with Floodplain Habitat Assessment and Mitigation Draft Regional Guidance, 2011, FEMA Region 10.

a. If the USFWS or NMFS issues an incidental take permit under Section 10 ESA, or biological opinion under this section, the permit can be considered to qualify as a plan to mitigate those impacts.

b. If the project is located outside the protected area, the mitigation plan shall include such avoidance, minimization, restoration, or compensation measures so that indirect adverse effects of development in the floodplain (effects to stormwater, riparian vegetation, bank stability, channel migration, hyporheic zones, wetlands, large woody debris, etc.) are mitigated such that equivalent or better habitat protection is provided.

c. No new stream crossings are allowed outside the protected area unless approval has been obtained as stated in subsection (G)(1)(a) of this section.

d. If the project is located in the protected area, the mitigation plan shall stipulate avoidance measures as are needed to ensure that there is no adverse effect during any phase of the project.

2. The plan’s habitat mitigation activities shall be incorporated into the proposed project. The floodplain development permit shall be based on the redesigned project and its mitigation components.

3. As required in SMC 13.12.700(E), the building official shall not issue a certification of use or a certificate of occupancy until all work identified in the habitat assessment and mitigation plan has been completed or the applicant has provided the necessary assurance that unfinished portions of the project will be completed, in accordance with SMC 13.12.700(E)(2).

14.10.020 City of Shoreline CTR plan.

The goals established for the jurisdiction and affected employers in the city’s commute trip reduction plan set forth in Attachment A* to the ordinance codified in this chapter are incorporated herein by reference. City staff is directed to make any corrections for typographical errors, include any graphical materials for information, and complete the commute trip reduction plan. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]

*Code reviser’s note: The city’s commute trip reduction plan as attached to Ord. 516 has been amended by Ords. 526, 658, 787 and 865.


14.10.030 CTR goals.

A. Commute Trip Reduction Goals. The city’s goals for reductions in the proportions of drive-alone commute trips and vehicle miles traveled per employee by affected employers in Shoreline, and other areas designated by the city, are hereby established by the city’s CTR plan incorporated by SMC 14.10.020. These goals establish the desired level of performance for the CTR program in its entirety in Shoreline. The city will set the individual worksite goals for affected employers based on how the worksite can contribute to Shoreline’s overall goal established in the CTR plan. The goals will appear as a component of the affected employer’s approved implementation plan outlined in SMC 14.10.060.

1. Commute Trip Reduction Goals for Affected Employers.

a. The drive-alone and VMT goals for affected employers in Shoreline are hereby established as set forth in the CTR plan incorporated by SMC 14.10.020.

b. If the goals for an affected employer or newly affected employer are not listed in the CTR plan, they shall be established by the city at a level designed to achieve Shoreline’s overall goals for the jurisdiction and other areas as designated by the city. The city shall provide written notification of the goals for each affected employer worksite by providing the information when the city reviews the employer’s proposed program and incorporating the goals into the program approval issued by the city. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.040 Responsible agency.

The city of Shoreline shall be responsible for implementing this chapter, the CTR plan and the city’s CTR program for its own employees. The city manager or their authorized designee shall have the authority to issue such rules and administrative procedures and delegate authority to other city departments as may be necessary to implement this chapter. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.050 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any affected employer within the geographic limits of the CTR plan adopted in SMC 14.10.020.

A. Notification of Applicability. In addition to the city’s established public notification for adoption of an ordinance, a notice of availability of a summary of this chapter, a notice of the requirements and criteria for affected employers to comply with this chapter, and subsequent revisions shall be published at least once in the city’s official newspaper not more than 30 days after passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter or revisions.

1. Affected employers located in Shoreline are to receive written notification that they are subject to this chapter. Such notice shall be addressed to the company’s chief executive officer, senior official, CTR program manager, or registered agent at the worksite. Such notification shall provide 90 days for the affected employer to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city.

2. Affected employers that, for whatever reason, do not receive notice within 30 days of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter and are either notified or identify themselves to the city within 90 days of the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter will be granted an extension to assure up to 90 days within which to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city.

3. Affected employers that have not been identified or do not identify themselves within 90 days of the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter and do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city within 90 days from the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

4. If an affected employer has already performed a baseline measurement, or an alternative acceptable to the city, under previous iterations of this chapter, the employer is not required to perform another baseline measurement.

B. Newly Affected Employers.

1. Employers meeting the definition of “affected employer” in this chapter must identify themselves to the city within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries outlined in the CTR plan adopted in SMC 14.10.020 or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees. Employers who do not identify themselves within 90 days are in violation of this chapter.

2. Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city. Employers who do not perform a baseline measurement within 90 days of receiving written notification that they are subject to this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

3. Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to the city. The program will be developed in consultation with city of Shoreline staff to be consistent with the goals of the CTR plan adopted in SMC 14.10.020. The program shall be implemented not more than 90 days after approval by the city. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties outlined in SMC 14.10.100(D).

C. Change in Status as an Affected Employer. Any of the following changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements:

1. If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the city that it is no longer an affected employer. The burden of proof lies with the employer.

2. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.

3. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an unaffected employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.060 Requirements for employers – RCW 70.94.531.

An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and drive-alone commute trips. The CTR program must include the mandatory elements as described below.

A. Mandatory Program Elements. Each employer’s CTR program shall include the following mandatory elements:

1. Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC). The employer shall designate an employee transportation coordinator (ETC) to administer the CTR program. The ETC and/or designee’s name, location, and telephone number must be prominently displayed physically or electronically at each affected worksite. The ETC shall oversee all elements of the employer’s CTR program and act as liaison between the employer and the city. The transportation coordinator must complete the basic ETC training course as provided by King County within six months of assuming the status of designated transportation coordinator, in order to help ensure consistent knowledge and understanding of CTR laws, rules and guidelines statewide. The objective is to have an effective transportation coordinator presence at each worksite; an affected employer with multiple sites may have one ETC for all sites.

2. Information Distribution. Information about alternatives to drive-alone commuting as well as a summary of the employer’s CTR program shall be provided to employees at least once a year and to new employees at the time of hire. The summary of the employer’s CTR program shall also be submitted to the city with the employer’s program description and regular report.

B. Additional Program Elements. In addition to the specific program elements described above, the employer’s CTR program shall include additional elements as needed to meet CTR goals. Elements may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

1. Provision of preferential parking for high-occupancy vehicles;

2. Reduced parking charges for high-occupancy vehicles;

3. Instituting or increasing parking charges for drive-alone commuters;

4. Provision of commuter ride matching services to facilitate employee ridesharing for commute trips;

5. Provision of subsidies for rail, transit, or vanpool fares and/or transit passes;

6. Provision of vans or buses for employee ridesharing;

7. Provision of subsidies for carpools, walking, bicycling, teleworking, or compressed schedules;

8. Provision of incentives for employees that do not drive alone to work;

9. Permitting the use of the employer’s vehicles for carpooling or vanpooling;

10. Permitting flexible work schedules to facilitate employees’ use of transit, carpools, or vanpools;

11. Cooperation with transportation providers to provide additional regular or express service to the worksite;

12. Construction of special loading and unloading facilities for transit, carpool, and vanpool users;

13. Provision of bicycle parking facilities, lockers, changing areas, and showers for employees who bicycle or walk to work;

14. Provision of a program of parking incentives such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities;

15. Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes which reduces commute trips;

16. Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed work week, which reduces commute trips;

17. Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities, emergency taxi services, or guaranteed ride home programs;

18. Charging employees for parking, and/or the elimination of free parking; and

19. Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site.

C. CTR Program Report and Description. Affected employers shall review their program and file a regular progress report with the city in accordance with the format provided by the city. The CTR program report and description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for the reporting period. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements. At a minimum, the employer’s CTR program report and description must include:

1. A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;

2. The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;

3. Documentation on compliance with the mandatory CTR program elements as described in subsection A of this section;

4. Description of any additional elements included in the employer’s CTR program as described in subsection B of this section; and

5. A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer’s established goals.

D. Biennial Measure of Employee Commute Behavior. In addition to the baseline measurement, employers shall conduct a program evaluation as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect commute trip reduction program employee questionnaires (surveys) at least once every two years, and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.070 Record keeping.

Affected employers shall maintain a copy of their approved CTR program description and report, their CTR program employee questionnaire results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to the city for a minimum of 48 months. The city and the employer shall agree on the record keeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.080 Schedule and process for CTR program description and report.

A. Document Review. The city shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or annual report within 90 days of submission, the employer’s program or annual report is deemed accepted. The city may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

B. Schedule. Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, the city shall establish the employer’s regular reporting date. This report will be provided in a form provided by the city consistent with SMC 14.10.060(C).

C. Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the city for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exist:

1. The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or

2. The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.

D. The city may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request.

E. Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description and report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The city shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s annual reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the city.

F. Implementation of Employer’s CTR Program. Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from the city that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from the city. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.090 Exemptions and goal modifications.

A. Worksite Exemptions. An affected employer may request the city to grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its workforce, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of drive-alone trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by the city at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The city shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

B. Employee Exemptions. Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a worksite’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. The city will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The city shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

C. Modification of CTR Program Goals.

1. An affected employer may request that the city modify its CTR program goals. Such requests shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description or annual report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program.

2. The city will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines.

3. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after city/county approval of its initial program description or annual report. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.100 Enforcement.

A. Compliance. For purposes of this section, “compliance” shall mean:

1. Fully implementing in good faith all mandatory program elements as well as provisions in the approved CTR program description and report;

2. Providing a complete CTR program description and report on the regular reporting date; and

3. Distributing and collecting the CTR program employee questionnaire during the scheduled survey time period.

B. Program Modification Criteria. The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:

1. If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program;

2. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required;

3. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable drive-alone or VMT reduction goal, the city shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description and report, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The city shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the city will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the city within 10 working days of the conference.

C. Violations. The following constitute violations of this chapter:

1. Failure to self-identify as an affected employer;

2. Failure to perform a baseline measurement, including:

a. Employers notified or that have identified themselves to the city within 90 days of the ordinance codified in this chapter being adopted and that do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the requirements specified by the city within 90 days from the notification or self-identification;

b. Employers not identified or self-identified within 90 days of the ordinance codified in this chapter being adopted and that do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the requirements specified by the city within 90 days from the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter;

3. Failure to develop and/or submit on time a complete CTR program;

4. Failure to implement an approved CTR program, unless the program elements that are carried out can be shown through quantifiable evidence to meet or exceed VMT and drive-alone goals as specified in this chapter;

5. Submission of false or fraudulent data in response to survey requirements;

6. Failure to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534 and this chapter; or

7. Failure to revise a CTR program as defined in RCW 70.94.534(4) and this chapter.

D. Penalties.

1. A violation of this chapter shall be punishable as a civil infraction under Chapter 7.80 RCW, with each day of noncompliance constituting a separate violation. The civil penalty for a violation shall be $250.00 per day.

2. No affected employer with an approved CTR program which has made a good faith effort may be held liable for failure to reach the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal. An affected employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they:

a. Propose to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and

b. Advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the city and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with state law (RCW 70.94.531). [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]


14.10.110 Appeals of administrative decisions.

A. Appeal of Final Decisions. Employers may file a written appeal to the city’s hearing examiner of the city’s final decisions regarding the following actions:

1. Rejection of an employer’s proposed program.

2. Denial of an employer’s request for a waiver or modification of any of the requirements under this chapter or a modification of the employer’s program.

3. Denial of exemptions requested under SMC 14.10.090.

B. Appeals filed under this section must be filed with the city within 20 days after the employer receives notice of a final decision and shall stay the final decision. Determinations on appeals shall be based on whether the decision being appealed was consistent with the state law. [Ord. 516 § 1, 2008]

The city council finds that:

A. The protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of buildings, sites, districts, structures and objects of historical, cultural, architectural, engineering, geographic, ethnic and archeological significance located in the city of Shoreline are necessary for the prosperity, civic pride and general welfare of the residents of the city.

D. The purposes of this chapter are to:

1. Designate, preserve, protect, enhance, and perpetuate those sites, buildings, districts, structures and objects which reflect significant elements of the city of Shoreline’s, county’s, state’s and nation’s cultural, aesthetic, social, economic, political, architectural, ethnic, archaeological, engineering, historic and other heritage;



2. Redesignate two sites in the city of Shoreline, previously designated as historic landmarks by the King County historic preservation commission, as city of Shoreline historic landmarks, thereby entitling them to the same advantages, responsibilities and opportunities under the city of Shoreline ordinance as were available under the King County historic landmark ordinance and program. These two sites are Crawford Store, 2411 N.W. 195th Place (Block 11, Lots 5 and 6 of Richmond Beach) and the William E. Boeing House, “Aldarra,” Huckleberry Lane, the Highlands;

General Provisions


20.30.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish standard procedures, decision criteria, public notification, and timing for development decisions made by the City of Shoreline. These procedures are intended to:

	•		Promote timely and informed public participation; 

	•		Eliminate redundancy in the application, permit review, and appeals processes;

	•		Process permits equitably and expediently; 

	•		Balance the needs of permit applicants with neighbors; 

	•		Ensure that decisions are made consistently and predictably; and 

	•		Result in development that furthers City goals as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.

These procedures provide for an integrated and consolidated land use permit process. The procedures integrate the environmental review process with land use procedures, decisions, and consolidated appeal processes. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 1, 2000).


20.30.020 Administration.

The provisions of this chapter supersede all other procedural requirements that may exist in other sections of the City Code. 

When interpreting and applying the standards of this Code, its provisions shall be the minimum requirements.

Where conflicts occur between provisions of this Code and/or between the Code and other City regulations, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. Where conflict between the text of this Code and the zoning map ensue, the text of this Code shall prevail. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 2, 2000).

Subchapter 2.

Types of Actions


20.30.030 Basis.

There are four types of actions (or permits) that are reviewed under the provisions of this chapter. The types of actions are based on who makes the decision, the amount of discretion exercised by the decision making body, the level of impact associated with the decision, the amount and type of public input sought, and the type of appeal opportunity. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 3, 2000).


20.30.040 Ministerial decisions – Type A.

These decisions are based on compliance with specific, nondiscretionary and/or technical standards that are clearly enumerated. These decisions are made by the Director and are exempt from notice requirements.

However, permit applications, including certain categories of building permits, and permits for projects that require a SEPA threshold determination, are subject to public notice requirements specified in Table 20.30.050 for SEPA threshold determination, or SMC 20.30.045.

All permit review procedures and all applicable regulations and standards apply to all Type A actions. The decisions made by the Director under Type A actions shall be final. The Director’s decision shall be based upon findings that the application conforms (or does not conform) to all applicable regulations and standards.

Permit Review Procedures


20.30.080 Preapplication meeting.

A preapplication meeting is required prior to submitting an application for any Type B or Type C action and/or for an application for a project that may impact a critical area or its buffer consistent with SMC 20.80.045.

A preapplication meeting is required prior to submitting an application for any project requesting departures through the Deep Green Incentive Program to discuss why departures are necessary to achieve certification through International Living Future Institute, Built Green, US Green Building Council, Passive House Institute US, or Salmon Safe programs. A representative from the prospective certifying agency(ies) will be invited to the meeting, but their attendance is not mandatory. If the project would not otherwise require a preapplication meeting, the fee for the preapplication meeting will be waived.

Applicants for development permits under Type A actions are encouraged to participate in preapplication meetings with the City. Preapplication meetings with staff provide an opportunity to discuss the proposal in general terms, identify the applicable City requirements and the project review process including the permits required by the action, timing of the permits and the approval process.

Preapplication meetings are required prior to the neighborhood meeting.

The Director shall specify submittal requirements for preapplication meetings, which shall include a critical areas worksheet and, if available, preliminary critical area reports. Plans presented at the preapplication meeting are nonbinding and do not “vest” an application. (Ord. 839 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 760 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 724 § 1 (Exh.

Subchapter 5.

Nonconforming Uses, Lots, and Structures


20.30.280 Nonconformance.

A.    Any use, structure, lot or other site improvement (e.g., landscaping or signage), which was legally established prior to the effective date of a land use regulation that rendered it nonconforming, shall be considered nonconforming if:

1.    The use is now prohibited or cannot meet use limitations applicable to the zone in which it is located; or

2.    The use or structure does not comply with the development standards or other requirements of this Code;

3.    A change in the required permit review process shall not create a nonconformance.

B.    Abatement of Illegal Use, Structure or Development. Any use, structure, lot or other site improvement not established in compliance with use, lot size, building, and development standards in effect at the time of establishment shall be deemed illegal and shall be discontinued or terminated and subject to removal.

C.    Continuation and Maintenance of Nonconformance. A nonconformance may be continued or physically maintained as provided by this Code.

1.    Any nonconformance that is brought into conformance for any period of time shall forfeit status as a nonconformance.

2.    Discontinuation of Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use shall not be resumed when abandonment or discontinuance extends for 12 consecutive months.

3.    Repair or Reconstruction of Nonconforming Structure. Any structure nonconforming as to height or setback standards may be repaired or reconstructed; provided, that:

a.    The extent of the previously existing nonconformance is not increased;

b.    The building permit application for repair or reconstruction is submitted within 12 months of the occurrence of damage or destruction; and

c.    The provisions of Chapter 13.12 SMC, Floodplain Management, are met when applicable.

4.    Modifications to Nonconforming Structures. Modifications to a nonconforming structure may be permitted; provided, the modification does not increase the area, height or degree of an existing nonconformity. Modification of structures that are nonconforming with regards to critical areas may only be permitted consistent with SMC 20.80.040.

D.    Expansion of Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may be expanded subject to approval of a conditional use permit unless the indexed supplemental criteria (SMC 20.40.200) require a special use permit for expansion of the use under the Code. A nonconformance with the development standards shall not be created or increased and the total expansion shall not exceed 10 percent of the use area. Single-family additions shall be limited to 50 percent of the use area or 1,000 square feet, whichever is lesser (up to R-6 development standards), and shall not require a conditional use permit in the MUR-45' and MUR-70' zones. 

E.    Nonconforming Lots. Any permitted use may be established on an undersized lot, which cannot satisfy the lot size or width requirements of this Code; provided, that:

1.    All other applicable standards of the Code are met; or a variance has been granted;

2.    The lot was legally created and satisfied the lot size and width requirements applicable at the time of creation;

3.    The lot cannot be combined with contiguous undeveloped lots to create a lot of required size;

4.    No unsafe condition is created by permitting development on the nonconforming lot; and

5.    The lot was not created as a “special tract” to protect critical area, provide open space, or as a public or private access tract.

F.    Nonconformance Created by Government Action.

1.    Where a lot, tract, or parcel is occupied by a lawful use or structure, and where the acquisition of right-of-way, by eminent domain, dedication or purchase, by the City or a County, State, or Federal agency creates noncompliance of the use or structure regarding any requirement of this Code, such use or structure shall be deemed lawful and subject to regulation as a nonconforming use or structure under this section.

2.    Existing signs that are nonconforming may be relocated on the same parcel if displaced by government action, provided setback standards are met to the extent feasible. If an existing conforming or nonconforming sign would have setbacks reduced below applicable standards as a result of government action, the sign may be relocated on the same parcel to reduce the setback nonconformity to the extent feasible. To be consistent with SMC 20.50.590(A), the signs shall not be altered in size, shape, or height.

3.    A nonconforming lot created under this subsection shall qualify as a building site pursuant to RCW 58.17.210, provided the lot cannot be combined with a contiguous lot(s) to create a conforming parcel. 

G.    Change of Use – Single Tenant. If any applicant proposes a change of use on a lot used or occupied by a single tenant or use, the applicant shall meet those Code provisions determined by the Director to be reasonably related and applicable to the change in use. These provisions shall apply to the entire lot. If the development is nonconforming due to the number of parking spaces provided for the existing use, any change in use, which requires more parking than the previous use, shall provide additional parking consistent with current Code parking requirements.

H.    Change of Use – Multi-Tenant. If any applicant proposes a change of use on a portion of a lot occupied by multiple tenants or uses, the applicant shall meet those Code provisions determined by the Director to be reasonably related and applicable to the change in use. These provisions shall apply only to that geographic portion of the lot related to the use or tenant space on which the change is proposed. If the multi-tenant lot is nonconforming due to the number of parking spaces provided for the existing uses, any change in use, which requires more parking than the previous use, shall provide additional parking consistent with current Code parking requirements.

1.    The application of the critical area regulations, Chapter 20.80 SMC, Critical Areas, would deny all reasonable use of the property; and

2.    There is no other reasonable use of the property with less impact on the critical area; and

3.    Any alterations to the critical area would be the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property; and

4.    The proposed development does not create a health or safety hazard on or off the development site, will not be materially detrimental to the property or improvements in the vicinity, is consistent with the general purposes of this title and the public interest, and all reasonable mitigation measures have been implemented or assured; and

5.    The inability to derive reasonable economic use is not the result of the applicant’s action unless the action (a) was approved as part of a final land use decision by the City or other agency with jurisdiction; or (b) otherwise resulted in a nonconforming use, lot or structure as defined in this title; and

6.    Any alterations permitted to the critical area are mitigated in accordance with SMC 20.80.082 and relevant mitigation standards for the impacted critical area(s); and

7.    Consistent with SMC 20.80.050, Alteration of critical areas, the proposal attempts to protect the existing critical area functions and values consistent with the best available science and attempts to mitigate adversely impacted critical area functions and values to the fullest extent possible; and

8.    The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards; and

9.    If the proposal is located in the MUR-35' zone, then reasonable use shall be based on the allowable uses and standards for the R-6 zone.

C.    Development Standards. To allow for reasonable use of property and to minimize impacts on critical areas, the decision making authority may reduce setbacks by up to 50 percent, parking requirements by up to 50 percent, and may eliminate landscaping requirements. Such reductions shall be the minimum amount necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property, considering the character and scale of neighboring development.

D.    Priority. When multiple critical areas and critical area buffers may be affected by the application, the decision making authority should consider exceptions to critical areas regulations that occur in the following order of priority with number 4 having the highest protection:

1.    Geologic hazard area buffers;

2.    Wetland buffers;

3.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffers (excluding wetlands); and

4.    Geological hazard areas, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation critical areas protection standards in the order listed above in items 1 through 3. (Ord. 756 § 1 (Exh.

The master development plan shall consolidate development in a compact layout to make efficient use of the finite resource of undeveloped and underdeveloped land within the City.

5.    The master development plan proposal demonstrates that there is either sufficient capacity and infrastructure (e.g., roads, sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit facilities) in the transportation system (motorized and nonmotorized) to safely support the development proposed in all future phases or there will be adequate capacity and infrastructure by the time each phase of development is completed. If capacity or infrastructure must be increased to support the proposed master development plan, then the master development plan identifies a plan for funding the applicant’s proportionate share of the improvements.

6.    The master development plan proposal demonstrates that there is either sufficient capacity within public utility services such as water, sewer and stormwater to adequately serve the development proposed in all future phases, or there will be adequate capacity available by the time each phase of development is completed. If capacity must be increased to support the proposed master development plan, then the master development plan identifies a plan for funding the applicant’s proportionate share of the improvements.

7.    The master development plan proposal contains campus-specific design concepts related to architectural features (including but not limited to building setbacks, insets, facade breaks, and roofline variations) and site design standards, landscaping, provisions for open space and/or recreation areas, parking/traffic management and multimodal transportation standards that minimize conflicts and create transitions between the proposal site and adjacent neighborhoods and between institutional uses and residential uses.

8.    The master development plan proposal shall demonstrate that any proposed uses will be operated in a manner that does not create a public nuisance, as defined in SMC 20.30.740, for the surrounding neighborhood or other uses on the campus. Nuisances may include odors, noise, release of hazardous chemicals, or disproportionate calls for fire or police service.

D.    Amendments.

Minor amendments include any revision or modification of the previously approved master development plan that would result in any one or more of the following:

1.    An increase in the square footage of any proposed building or structure of up to 10 percent; or

2.    An increase of up to 15 percent in the number of new parking spaces, parking spaces created by restriping existing parking areas and/or a combination of both except for an increase in parking spaces for bicycles or electric vehicles; or

3.    A deviation in the approved master development plan phasing timeline which does not result in increased impacts or the need for additional mitigation; or

4.    Changes to building placement when located outside of the required setbacks and any required buffers for critical areas; or

5.    A cumulative increase in impervious surface of up to 10 percent or a cumulative decrease in tree cover of up to 10 percent; or

6.    Changes identified as minor amendments in the approved master development plan.

Major amendments are changes that exceed the thresholds for a minor amendment or were not analyzed as part of an approved master development plan. Major amendments to an approved master development plan shall be processed as a new master development plan.

E.    Development Standards.

1.    Density is limited to a maximum of 48 units per gross acre;

2.    Height is limited to a maximum of 65 feet;

b.    The proposal shall be designed to minimize grading by using shared driveways and by relating street, house site and lot placement to the existing topography.

c.    Where conditions exist which could be hazardous to the future residents of the land to be divided, or to nearby residents or property, such as floodplains, landslide hazards, or unstable soil or geologic conditions, a subdivision of the hazardous land shall be denied unless the condition can be permanently corrected, consistent with subsections (B)(1)(a) and (b) of this section, Chapter 20.80 SMC, Critical Areas, and Chapter 13.12 SMC, Floodplain Management.

d.    Low impact development (LID) techniques shall be applied where feasible to minimize impervious areas, manage stormwater, and preserve on-site natural features, native vegetation, open space and critical areas.

2.    Lot and Street Layout.

a.    Lots shall be designed to contain a usable building area. If the building area would be difficult to develop, the lot shall be redesigned or eliminated, unless special conditions can be imposed that will ensure the lot is developed consistent with the standards of this Code and does not create nonconforming structures, uses or lots.

b.    Lots shall not front on primary or secondary highways unless there is no other feasible access. Special access provisions, such as shared driveways, turnarounds or frontage streets, may be required to minimize traffic hazards.

c.    Each lot shall meet the applicable dimensional requirements of the Code.

i.    Required improvements may include, but are not limited to, streets, curbs, pedestrian walks and bicycle paths, critical area enhancements, sidewalks, street landscaping, water lines, sewage systems, drainage systems and underground utilities. 

4.    Unit Lot Subdivision.

a.    The provisions of this subsection apply exclusively to unit lot development, mixed single-family attached development, or zero lot line development.

b.    Unit lot, mixed single-family attached, and zero lot line developments may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet the applicable development standards.

c.    As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may modify standards in SMC 20.50.020, Exception 2.

d.    Access easements, joint use and maintenance agreements, and covenants, conditions and restrictions identifying the rights and responsibilities of the property owner(s) and/or the homeowners’ association shall be executed for the use and maintenance of common garage, parking and vehicle access areas; solid waste storage and/or collection area(s); on-site recreation; landscaping; underground utilities; common open space; exterior building facades and roofs of individual units; and other similar features, and shall be recorded with the King County Recorder’s Office. These shall be recorded prior to final plat application or shown on the face of the final plat.

e.    Within the parent lot, required parking for a dwelling unit may be provided on a different unit lot than the lot with the dwelling unit, as long as the right to use that parking is formalized by an easement set forth on the face of the plat.

f.    The final plat shall note all conditions of approval. The final plat shall also note that unit lots are not separate buildable lots independent of the overall development and that additional development of the individual unit lots may be limited as a result of the application of development standards to the parent lot.

g.    For unit lot development, the applicant shall record a covenant on the plat that states, “These units will be considered individual units and part of one structure that cannot be segregated from one another. A unit lot development is defined as one building or one structure in the International Building Code and International Fire Code and National Electrical Code.” (Ord. 871 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 819 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 767 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 724 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 641 § 4 (Exh.

20.30.420 Changes to approved subdivision.

A.    Preliminary Subdivision. The Director may approve minor changes to an approved preliminary subdivision, or its conditions of approval. If the proposal involves additional lots, rearrangements of lots or roads, additional impacts to surrounding property, or other major changes, the proposal shall be reviewed in the same manner as a new application.

B.    Recorded Final Plats. An application to alter a final plat that has been filed for record shall be processed as provided for in SMC 20.30.425. (Ord. 857 § 2(A) (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 8(g), 2000).


20.30.425 Alteration of recorded plats.

A.    Applicability. A plat alteration provides a process to alter or modify a previously recorded plat, short plat, binding site plan, or any portion thereof. The plat alteration results in changes to conditions of approval, restrictions, or dedications that are shown on the recorded plat.

b.    Establish a date for a public hearing or provide that a hearing may be requested by a person receiving notice within 14 calendar days of receipt of the notice. The cost of the public hearing shall be the responsibility of the applicant for the plat alteration.

2.    Public Hearing. If a public hearing is timely requested, notice of the public hearing shall be provided as set forth in SMC 20.30.180.

D.    Review Criteria.

1.    Decision-Making Authority.

a.    Director. Applications for a plat alteration are a Type B action and shall be administratively reviewed by the Director unless a public hearing has been timely requested as provided in subsection(C)(2) of this section or the City determines that a public hearing is in the public interest, in which case it is a Type C action.

b.    Hearing Examiner. Applications for a plat alteration for which a public hearing has been requested are a Type C action. An open record public hearing before the Hearing Examiner shall be held and the Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision.

2.    The decision-making authority shall review the submittal materials and may approve or deny after a written determination is made whether the public use and interest will be served by the alteration and whether the alteration satisfies the review criteria set forth in SMC 20.30.410(B).

3.    In any written determination approving an alteration:

a.    If any land within the alteration is part of an assessment district, any outstanding assessments shall be equitably divided and levied against the remaining lots, parcels, or tracts, or be levied equitably on the lots resulting from the alteration.

b.    If any land within the alteration contains a dedication to the general use of persons residing within the subdivision, such land may be altered and divided equitably between the adjacent properties.

4.    The Director’s decision is final unless appealed to the Hearing Examiner as provided in subsection F of this section. The Hearing Examiner’s decision on a plat alteration for which a public hearing was requested is final and may be appealed to superior court pursuant to Chapter 36.70C RCW, Land Use Petition Act.

E.    Recording of Alteration. No later than 30 calendar days after approval of the alteration, the applicant shall produce a revised drawing or text of the approved alteration to the plat, conforming to the recording requirements of Chapter 58.17 RCW and processed for signature in the same manner as set forth for final plats in this chapter. The applicant shall file, at their sole cost and expense, the revision approved by the alteration to the plat with the King County Recorder to become the lawful plat of the property.

B.    Completion – Bonding. The applicant shall either complete the improvements before the final plat is submitted for City Council approval, or the applicant shall post a bond or other suitable surety to guarantee the completion of the improvements within one year of the approval of the final plat. The bond or surety shall be based on the construction cost of the improvement as determined by the Director.

C.    Acceptance – Maintenance Bond. The Director shall not accept the improvements for the City of Shoreline until the improvements have been inspected and found satisfactory, and the applicant has posted a bond or surety for 15 percent of the construction cost to guarantee against defects of workmanship and materials for two years from the date of acceptance. (Ord. 819 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 8(i), 2000).


20.30.450 Final plat review procedures.

Time limit: A final short plat or final formal plat meeting all of the requirements of this chapter and Chapter 58.17 RCW shall be submitted for approval within the time frame specified in RCW 58.17.140.

A.    Submission. The applicant may not file the final plat for review until the work required for the site development and right-of-way permits is completed and passed final inspection or bonded per the requirements of SMC 20.30.440.

B.    Final Short Plat. The Director shall conduct an administrative review of a proposed final short plat. Only when the Director finds that a proposed short plat conforms to all terms of the preliminary short plat and meets the requirements of Chapter 58.17 RCW, other applicable State laws, and SMC Title 20 which were in effect at the time when the preliminary short plat application was deemed complete, the Director shall sign on the face of the short plat signifying the Director’s approval of the final short plat.

C.    Final Formal Plat. After an administrative review by the Director, the final formal plat shall be presented to the City Council. Only when the City Council finds that a subdivision proposed for final plat approval conforms to all terms of the preliminary plat, and meets the requirements of Chapter 58.17 RCW, other applicable State laws, and SMC Title 20 which were in effect at the time when the preliminary plat application was deemed complete, the City Manager shall sign on the face of the plat signifying the City Council’s approval of the final plat.

D.    Acceptance of Dedication. City Council’s approval of a final formal plat or the Director’s approval of a final short plat constitutes acceptance of all dedication shown on the final plat. 

E.    Filing for Record. The applicant for subdivision shall file the original drawing of the final plat for recording with the King County Department of Records and Elections. One reproduced full copy on mylar and/or sepia material shall be furnished to the Department. (Ord. 819 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 515 § 1, 2008; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 8(j), 2000).


20.30.460 Effect of changes in statutes, ordinances, and regulations on vesting of final plats.

All lots in a final short plat or final plat shall be a valid land use notwithstanding any change in zoning laws for the period specified in RCW 58.17.170 from the date of filing. A subdivision shall be governed by the terms of approval of the final plat, and the statutes, ordinances, and regulations in effect at the time of approval under RCW 58.17.150(1) and (3) for the period specified in RCW 58.17.170 after final plat approval unless the Council finds that a change in conditions creates a serious threat to the public health or safety in the subdivision. (Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 352 § 1, 2004; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 8(k), 2000).


20.30.470 Further division – Short subdivisions.

A further division of any lot created by a short subdivision shall be reviewed as and meet the requirements of this subchapter for formal subdivision if the further division is proposed within five years from the date the final plat was filed for record; provided, however, that when a short plat contains fewer than nine parcels, nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted to prevent the owner who filed the original short plat from filing a revision thereof within the five-year period in order to create up to a total of nine lots within the original short subdivision boundaries. (Ord. 767 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 8(l), 2000).


20.30.480 Binding site plans – Type B action.

A.    Commercial and Industrial. This process may be used to divide commercially and industrially zoned property, as authorized by State law. On sites that are fully developed, the binding site plan merely creates or alters interior lot lines. In all cases the binding site plan ensures, through written agreements among all lot owners, that the collective lots continue to function as one site concerning but not limited to: lot access, interior circulation, open space, landscaping and drainage; facility maintenance, and coordinated parking. The following applies:

1.    Sites subject to binding site plans shall consist of one or more contiguous lots legally created.

2.    Sites subject to binding site plans may be reviewed independently, or concurrently with a commercial development permit application. 

3.    The binding site plan process merely creates or alters lot lines and does not authorize substantial improvements or changes to the property or the uses thereon. 

B.    Recording and Binding Effect. Prior to recording, the approved binding site plan shall be surveyed and the final recording forms shall be prepared by a professional land surveyor, licensed in the State of Washington. Surveys shall include those items prescribed by State law.

C.    Amendment, Modification and Vacation. The Director may approve minor changes to an approved binding site plan, or its conditions of approval. If the proposal involves additional lots, rearrangements of lots or roads, additional impacts to surrounding property, or other major changes, the proposal shall be reviewed in the same manner as a new application. (Ord. 695 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 439 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 8(m), 2000).

E.    The responsible official shall retain all documents required by the SEPA Rules and make them available in accordance with Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(d), 2000).


20.30.530 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

A.    When the City receives an application for or initiates a proposal that involves a nonexempt action, the responsible official shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050, 197-11-253, and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940; unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the responsible official is aware that another agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

B.    When the City is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the City shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No City department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless the responsible official determines a supplemental environmental review is necessary under WAC 197-11-600.

C.    If the City, or any of its departments, receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the City must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the City may be initiated by the responsible official or any department.

D.    The responsible official is authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944.

E.    The responsible official shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal.

F.    When the City is lead agency for a MTCA remedial action, the Department of Ecology shall be provided an opportunity under WAC 197-11-253(5) to review the environmental documents prior to public notice being provided. If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with one public comment period under WAC 197-11-253(6), the responsible official shall decide jointly with the Department of Ecology who receives the comment letters and how copies of the comment letters will be distributed to the other agency. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(e), 2000).


20.30.540 Timing and content of environmental review. 

A.    Categorical Exemptions. The City will normally identify whether an action is categorically exempt within 10 days of receiving a complete application.

B.    Threshold Determinations. When the City is lead agency for a proposal, the following threshold determination timing requirements apply:

1.    If a DS is made concurrent with the notice of application, the DS and scoping notice shall be combined with the notice of application (RCW 36.70B.110). Nothing in this subsection prevents the DS/scoping notice from being issued before the notice of application. If sufficient information is not available to make a threshold determination when the notice of application is issued, the DS may be issued later in the review process. 

2.    If the City is lead agency and project proponent or is funding a project, the City may conduct its review under SEPA and may allow appeals of procedural determinations prior to submitting a project permit application.

3.    If an open record predecision hearing is required, the threshold determination shall be issued at least 15 days before the open record predecision hearing (RCW 36.70B.110 (6)(b)).

4.    The optional DNS process in WAC 197-11-355 may be used to indicate on the notice of application that the lead agency is likely to issue a DNS. If this optional process is used, a separate comment period on the DNS may not be required (refer to WAC 197-11-355(4)).

C.    For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or draft EIS for the proposal shall accompany the City’s staff recommendation to the appropriate review authority. If the final EIS is or becomes available, it shall be substituted for the draft.

D.    The optional provision of WAC 197-11-060(3)(c) is adopted. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(f), 2000).

	•    	Any nonexempt action;

	•    	Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or

	•    	Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives.

2.    The responsible official may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

3.    The responsible official may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(i), 2000).


20.30.580 Environmental checklist. 

A.    A completed environmental checklist shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not exempted in this ordinance; except, a checklist is not needed if the City’s responsible official and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. Except as provided in subsection E of this section, the checklist shall be in the form of WAC 197-11-960 with such additions that may be required by the responsible official in accordance with WAC 197-11-906(4).

B.    For private proposals, the responsible official will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For City proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

C.    The responsible official may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

1.    The City has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

2.    The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration; or

3.    On the request of the applicant.

D.    The applicant shall pay to the City the actual costs of providing information under subsections (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this section.

E.    For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the City shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part of a planned action ordinance; or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a 30-day review prior to use.

F.    The lead agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the information in the environmental checklist and shall have the authority to determine the final content of the environmental checklist. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(j), 2000).


20.30.590 Mitigated DNS.

A.    As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B.    An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

1.    Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the Department is lead agency; and

2.    Precede the City’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C.    The responsible official’s response to the request for early request shall:

1.    Be written;

2.    State whether the City currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the City to consider a DS; and

3.    State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D.    When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the City shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

1.    If the City indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the City shall issue and circulate a DNS if the City determines that no additional information or mitigation measures are required.

2.    If the City indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the City shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3.    The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures, clarifications, changes or conditions must be in writing and must be specific. 

4.    Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

E.    A mitigated DNS is issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application.

F.    Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the City.

G.    If at any time the proposed mitigation measures are withdrawn or substantially changed, the responsible official shall review the threshold determination and, if necessary, may withdraw the mitigated DNS and issue a DS. 

H.    If the City’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the City should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) relating to the withdrawal of a DNS.

I.    The City’s written response under subsection (C) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the City to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(k), 2000).

F.    The City may require an applicant to provide information the City does not possess, including information that must be obtained by specific investigations. This provision is not intended to expand or limit an applicant’s other obligations under WAC 197-11-100, or other provisions of regulations, statute, or ordinance.

G.    In the event an applicant decides to suspend or abandon the project, the applicant must provide formal written notice to the Department and consultant. The applicant shall continue to be responsible for all monies expended by the Department or consultants to the point of receipt of notification to suspend or abandon, or other obligations or penalties under the terms of any contract let for preparation of the environmental documents.

H.    The Department shall only publish an environmental impact statement (EIS) when it believes that the EIS adequately discloses the significant direct, indirect, and cumulative adverse impacts of the proposal and its alternatives; mitigation measures proposed and committed to by the applicant, and their effectiveness in significantly mitigating impacts; mitigation measures that could be implemented or required; and unavoidable significant adverse impacts.

5.    Such conditions are based on one or more policies in SMC 20.30.670 and cited in the permit, approval, license or other decision document.

B.    The City may deny a permit or approval for a proposal on the basis of SEPA so long as:

1.    A finding is made that approving the proposal would result in probable significant adverse environmental impacts that are identified in a FEIS or final supplemental EIS; and

2.    A finding is made that there are no reasonable mitigation measures capable of being accomplished that are sufficient to mitigate the identified impact; and

3.    The denial is based on one or more policies identified in SMC 20.30.670 and identified in writing in the decision document. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(r), 2000).

B.    For the purposes of RCW 43.21C.060 and WAC 197-11-660(a), the following policies, plans, rules and regulations, and all amendments thereto, are designated as potential bases for the exercise of the City’s substantive authority to condition or deny proposals under SEPA, subject to the provisions of RCW 43.21C.240 and SMC 20.30.660.

1.    The policies of the State Environmental Policy Act, RCW 43.21C.020.

20.30.680 Appeals.

A.    Any interested person may appeal a threshold determination or the conditions or denials of a requested action made by a nonelected official pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section and Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 4, General Provisions for Land Use Hearings and Appeals. No other SEPA appeal shall be allowed.

1.    Only one administrative appeal of each threshold determination shall be allowed on a proposal. Procedural appeals shall be consolidated in all cases with substantive SEPA appeals, if any, involving decisions to approve, condition or deny an action pursuant to RCW 43.21C.060 with the public hearing or appeal, if any, on the proposal, except for appeals of a DS.

2.    As provided in RCW 43.21C.075(3)(d), the decision of the responsible official shall be entitled to substantial weight.

3.    An appeal of a DS must be filed within 14 calendar days following issuance of the DS.

4.    All SEPA appeals of a DNS for actions classified in Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 2, Types of Actions, as Type A or B, or C actions for which the Hearing Examiner has review authority, must be filed within 14 calendar days following notice of the threshold determination as provided in SMC 20.30.150, Public notice of decision; provided, that the appeal period for a DNS for Type A or B actions issued at the same time as the final decision shall be extended for an additional seven calendar days if WAC 197-11-340(2)(a) applies.

5.    The Hearing Examiner shall make a final decision on all procedural SEPA determinations. The Hearing Examiner’s decision may be appealed to superior court as provided in Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 4, General Provisions for Land Use Hearings and Appeals.

B.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A) of this section, the Department may adopt procedures under which an administrative appeal shall not be provided if the Director finds that consideration of an appeal would be likely to cause the Department to violate a compliance, enforcement or other specific mandatory order or specific legal obligation. The Director’s determination shall be included in the notice of the SEPA determination, and the Director shall provide a written summary upon which the determination is based within five days of receiving a written request. Because there would be no administrative appeal in such situations, review may be sought before a court of competent jurisdiction under RCW 43.21C.075 and applicable regulations, in connection with an appeal of the underlying governmental action. (Ord. 695 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 591 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 352 § 1, 2004; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 9(t), 2000).

Subchapter 9.

Code Enforcement


20.30.720 Purpose.

This subchapter is an exercise of the City’s power to protect the public health, safety and welfare; and its purpose is to provide enforcement of Code Violations, abatement of nuisances, and collection of abatement expenses by the City. This Code shall be enforced for the benefit of the general public, not for the benefit of any particular person or class of persons.

It is the intent of this subchapter to place the obligation for Code compliance upon the responsible party, within the scope of this subchapter, and not to impose any duty upon the City or any of its officers, officials or employees which would subject them to damages in a civil action. (Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(a), 2000).


20.30.730 General provisions.

A.    For the purposes of this subchapter, any person who causes or maintains a code violation and the owner, lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use, or occupancy of property where a code violation occurs shall be identified as the responsible party and shall be subject to enforcement action as provided in this subchapter.

    However, if a property owner affirmatively demonstrates that the action which resulted in the violation was taken without the owner’s knowledge or consent by someone other than the owner or someone acting on the owner’s behalf, that owner shall be responsible only for bringing the property into compliance to the extent reasonably feasible under the circumstances, as determined by the Director. Should the responsible party not correct the violation, after service of the notice and order, civil penalties and abatement costs may be assessed.

B.    It shall be the responsibility of any person identified as a responsible party to bring the property into a safe and reasonable condition to achieve compliance. Payment of fines, applications for permits, acknowledgment of stop work orders and compliance with other remedies does not substitute for performing the corrective work required and having the property brought into compliance to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances. The date set for compliance in the notice and order takes precedence over any date established for the expiration of any required permit(s) and will be subordinate only to written extension of the notice and order.

C.    The responsible parties have a duty to notify the Director of any actions taken to achieve compliance. A violation shall be considered ongoing until the responsible party has come into compliance and has notified the Director of this compliance, and an official inspection has verified compliance and all assessed penalties and costs have been paid to the City.

D.    The procedures set forth in this subchapter are not exclusive; specifically the provisions in SMC 20.80.130 additionally apply to code enforcement of violations of Chapter 20.80 SMC, Critical Areas. These procedures shall not in any manner limit or restrict the City from remedying or abating code violations in any other manner authorized by law. (Ord. 724 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 515 § 1, 2008; Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 391 § 4, 2005; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(b), 2000).


20.30.740 Declaration of public nuisance, enforcement.

A.    A code violation, as used in this subchapter, is declared to be a public nuisance and includes violations of the following:

1.    Any City land use and development ordinances or public health ordinances;

2.    Any public nuisance as set forth in Chapters 7.48 and 9.66 RCW;

3.    Violation of any of the codes adopted in Chapter 15.05 SMC;

4.    Violation of provisions of Chapter 12.15 SMC, Use of Right-of-Way;

5.    Any accumulation of refuse, except as provided in Chapter 13.14 SMC, Solid Waste Code;

6.    Nuisance vegetation;

7.    Discarding or dumping of any material onto the public right-of-way, waterway, or other public property;

8.    Violation of any of the provisions of Chapter 13.10 SMC, Surface Water Utility; and

9.    Violations of any of the provisions of Chapter 13.12 SMC, Floodplain Management.

B.    No act which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute or ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance. (Ord. 641 § 4 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 531 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2009; Ord. 466 § 2, 2007; Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 391 § 4, 2005; Ord. 251 § 2(E), 2000; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(d), 2000. Formerly 20.30.750).


20.30.750 Junk vehicles as public nuisances.

A.    Storing junk vehicles as defined in SMC 10.05.030(A)(1) upon private property within the City limits shall constitute a nuisance and shall be subject to the penalties as set forth in this section, and shall be abated as provided in this section; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to:

1.    A vehicle or part thereof that is completely enclosed within a permanent building in a lawful manner, or the vehicle is not visible from the street or from other public or private property; or

2.    A vehicle is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed dismantler or licensed vehicle dealer and is fenced according to RCW 46.80.130.

B.    Whenever a vehicle has been certified as a junk vehicle under RCW 46.55.230, the last registered vehicle owner of record, if the identity of the owner can be determined, and the landowner of record where the vehicle is located shall each be given legal notice in accordance with SMC 20.30.770(F) that a public hearing may be requested before the Hearing Examiner. If no hearing is requested within 14 days from the date of service, the vehicle, or part thereof, shall be removed by the City. The towing company, vehicle wrecker, hulk hauler or scrap processor will notify the Washington State Patrol and the Department of Licensing of the disposition of the vehicle.

C.    If the landowner is not the registered or legal owner of the vehicle, no abatement action shall be commenced sooner than 20 days after certification as a junk vehicle to allow the landowner to remove the vehicle under the procedures of RCW 46.55.230.

D.    If a request for hearing is received within 14 days, a notice giving the time, location and date of such hearing on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or parts thereof shall be mailed by certified mail to the landowner of record and to the last registered and legal owner of record of each vehicle unless ownership cannot be determined.



E.    The owner of the land on which the vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with the reasons for the denial. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that the landowner has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, then the local agency shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect the cost from the owner.

F.    The City may remove any junk vehicle after complying with the notice requirements of this section. The vehicle shall be disposed of by a licensed towing company, vehicle wrecker, hulk hauler or scrap processor with the disposing company giving notice to the Washington State Patrol and to the Department of Licensing of the disposition of the vehicle.

G.    The costs of abatement and removal of any such vehicle or remnant part shall be collected from the last registered vehicle owner if the identity of such owner can be determined, unless such owner has transferred ownership and complied with RCW 46.12.101, or the costs may be assessed against the owner of the property on which the vehicle or remnant part is located, unless the landowner has prevailed in a hearing as specified in SMC 20.30.760(E). Costs shall be paid to the Finance Director within 30 days of the removal of the vehicle or remnant part and, if delinquent, shall be assessed against the real property upon which such cost was incurred as set forth in SMC 20.30.775. (Ord. 515 § 1, 2008; Ord. 469 § 1, 2007; Ord. 466 § 2, 2007; Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(e), 2000. Formerly 20.30.760).


20.30.760 Notice and orders.

Whenever the Director has reason to believe that a Code Violation exists or has occurred, the Director is authorized to issue a notice and order to correct the violation to any responsible party. A stop work order shall be considered a notice and order to correct. Issuance of a citation or stop work order is not a condition precedent to the issuance of any other notice and order.

A.    Subject to the appeal provisions of SMC 20.30.790, a notice and order represents a determination that a Code Violation has occurred and that the cited person is a responsible party.

B.    Failure to correct the Code Violation in the manner prescribed by the notice and order subjects the person cited to any of the compliance remedies provided by this subchapter, including:

1.    Civil penalties and costs;

2.    Continued responsibility for abatement, remediation and/or mitigation;

3.    Permit suspension, revocation, modification and/or denial; and/or

4.    Costs of abatement by the City, according to the procedures described in this subchapter.

C.    Any person identified in the notice and order as a responsible party may appeal the notice and order within 14 days of service, according to the procedures described in SMC 20.30.220 and 20.30.790. Failure to appeal the notice and order within 14 days of issuance shall render the notice and order a final determination that the conditions described in the notice and order existed and constituted a Code Violation, and that the named party is liable as a responsible party.

D.    Issuance of a notice and order in no way limits the Director’s authority to issue a criminal citation or notice of infraction. 

E.    The notice and order shall contain the following information:

1.    The address, when available, or location of the Code Violation;

2.    A legal description of the real property where the violation occurred or is located;

3.    A statement that the Director has found the named person to have committed a Code Violation and a brief description of the violation or violations found;

4.    A statement of the specific provisions of the ordinance, resolution, regulation, public rule, permit condition, notice and order provision or stop work order that was or is being violated;

5.    The civil penalty assessed for failure to comply with the order;

6.    A statement advising that the notice and order may be recorded against the property in the King County Office of Records and Elections subsequent to service;

7.    A statement of the corrective or abatement action required to be taken and that all required permits to perform the corrective action must be obtained from the proper issuing agency;

8.    A statement advising that, if any required work is not completed or a written extension for completion obtained within the time specified by the notice and order, the Director may proceed to abate the violation and cause the work to be done and charge the costs thereof as a lien against the property and as a joint and several personal obligation of all responsible parties;

9.    A statement advising that, if any assessed penalty, fee or cost is not paid on or before the due date, the Director may charge the unpaid amount as a lien against the property where the Code Violation occurred and as a joint and several personal obligation of all responsible parties;

10.    A statement advising that any person named in the notice and order or having any record or equitable title in the property against which the notice and order is recorded may appeal from the notice and order to the Hearing Examiner within 14 days of the date of issuance of the notice and order;

11.    A statement advising that a failure to correct the violations cited in the notice and order could lead to the denial of subsequent City permit applications on the subject property;

12.    A statement advising that a failure to appeal the notice and order within the applicable time limits renders the notice and order a final determination that the conditions described in the notice and order existed and constituted a Code Violation, and that the named party is liable as a responsible party; and

13.    A statement advising the responsible party of their duty to notify the Director of any actions taken to achieve compliance with the notice and order.

F.    Service of a notice and order shall be made on any responsible party by one or more of the following methods:

1.    Personal service may be made on the person identified as being a responsible party.

2.    Service directed to the landowner and/or occupant of the property may be made by posting the notice and order in a conspicuous place on the property where the violation occurred and concurrently mailing notice as provided for below, if a mailing address is available.

3.    Service by mail may be made for a notice and order by mailing by certified mail, to the responsible party at their last known address, at the address of the violation, or at the address of their place of business. The taxpayer’s address as shown on the tax records of the county shall be deemed to be the proper address for the purpose of mailing such notice to the landowner of the property where the violation occurred. The City may mail a copy, postage prepaid, by ordinary first class mail. Service by mail shall be presumed effective upon the third business day following the day the notice and order was mailed.

The failure of the Director to make or attempt service on any person named in the notice and order shall not invalidate any proceedings as to any other person duly served.

G.    Whenever a notice and order is served on a responsible party, the Director may file a copy of the same with the King County Office of Records and Elections. When all violations specified in the notice and order have been corrected or abated, the Director shall issue a certificate of compliance to the parties listed on the notice and order. The responsible party is responsible for filing the certificate of compliance with the King County Office of Records and Elections, if the notice and order was recorded. The certificate shall include a legal description of the property where the violation occurred and shall state that any unpaid civil penalties, for which liens have been filed, are still outstanding and continue as liens on the property.

H.    The Director may revoke or modify a notice and order issued under this section. Such revocation or modification shall identify the reasons and underlying facts for revocation. The Director may add to, rescind in whole or part or otherwise modify or revoke a notice and order by issuing a supplemental notice and order. The supplemental notice and order shall be governed by the same procedures applicable to all notice and orders contained in this section.

I.    Failure to correct a Code Violation in the manner and within the time frame specified by the notice and order subjects the responsible party to civil penalties as set forth in SMC 20.30.770.

1.    Civil penalties assessed create a joint and several personal obligation in all responsible parties. The City Attorney may collect the civil penalties assessed by any appropriate legal means.

2.    Civil penalties assessed also authorize the City to take a lien for the value of civil penalties imposed against the real property of the responsible party.

3.    The payment of penalties does not relieve a responsible party of any obligation to cure, abate or stop a violation. (Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 515 § 1, 2008; Ord. 469 § 1, 2007; Ord. 466 §§ 2, 3, 2007; Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 391 § 4, 2005; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(f), 2000. Formerly 20.30.770).


20.30.770 Enforcement provisions.

A.    Infraction. Whenever the Director has determined that a code violation has occurred, the Director may issue a Class 1 civil infraction, or other class of infraction specified in the particular ordinance violated, to any responsible party, according to the provisions set forth in Chapter 7.80 RCW.

B.    Misdemeanor. Any person who willfully or knowingly causes, aids or abets a code violation by any act of commission or omission is guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon conviction, the person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment in the County jail for a term not to exceed 90 days. Each week (seven days) such violation continues shall be considered a separate misdemeanor offense. A misdemeanor complaint or notice of infraction may be filed as an alternative, or in addition, to any other judicial or administrative remedy provided in this subchapter or by law or other regulation.

C.    Suspension, Revocation or Limitation of Permit.

1.    The Director may suspend, revoke or limit any permit issued whenever:

a.    The permit holder has committed a code violation in the course of performing activities subject to that permit;

b.    The permit holder has interfered with the Director in the performance of their duties relating to that permit;

c.    The permit was issued in error or on the basis of materially incorrect information supplied to the City; or

d.    Permit fees or costs were paid to the City by check and returned from a financial institution marked nonsufficient funds (NSF) or cancelled.

2.    Such suspension, revocation or modification shall be carried out through the notice and order provisions of this subchapter and shall be effective upon the compliance date established by the notice and order. Such revocation, suspension or cancellation may be appealed to the Hearing Examiner using the appeal provisions of this subchapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Director may immediately suspend operations under any permit by issuing a stop work order.

D.    Civil Penalties.

1.    A civil penalty for violation of the terms and conditions of a notice and order shall be imposed in the amount of $500.00. The total initial penalties assessed for notice and orders and stop work orders pursuant to this section shall apply for the first 14-day period following the violation of the order, if no appeal is filed. The penalties for the next 14-day period shall be 150 percent of the initial penalties, and the penalties for the next 14-day period and each such period or portion thereafter shall be double the amount of the initial penalties.

2.    Any responsible party who has committed a violation of the provisions of Chapter 20.50 SMC, General Development Standards (tree conservation, land clearing and site grading standards), or Chapter 20.80 SMC, Critical Areas, will not only be required to restore unlawfully removed trees or damaged critical areas, insofar as that is possible and beneficial, as determined by the Director, but will also be required to pay civil penalties in addition to penalties under subsection (D)(1) of this section, for the redress of ecological, recreation, and economic values lost or damaged due to the violation. Civil penalties will be assessed according to the following factors:

a.    For violations within critical areas and required buffers, an amount determined pursuant to SMC 20.80.130(E); or

b.    For violations not located within critical areas and required buffers, an amount determined to be equivalent to the economic benefit that the responsible party derives from the violation measured as the total of:

i.    The resulting increase in market value of the property; and

ii.    The value received by the responsible party; and

iii.    The savings of construction costs realized by the responsible party as a result of performing any act in violation of the chapter; and

c.    A penalty of $2,000 if the violation has severe ecological impacts, including temporary or permanent loss of resource values or functions.

3.    An additional penalty of $2,000 if the violation was deliberate, the result of knowingly false information submitted by the property owner, agent, or contractor, or the result of reckless disregard on the part of the property owner, agent, or their contractor. The property owner shall assume the burden of proof for demonstrating that the violation was not deliberate.

4.    A repeat violation means a violation of the same regulation in any location within the City by the same responsible party, for which voluntary compliance previously has been sought or any enforcement action taken, within the immediate preceding 24-consecutive-month period, and will incur double the civil penalties set forth above.

5.    Under RCW 59.18.085, if, after 60 days from the date that the City first advanced relocation assistance funds to displaced tenants, the landlord does not repay the amount of relocation assistance advanced by the City, the City shall assess civil penalties in the amount of $50.00 per day for each tenant to whom the City has advanced a relocation assistance payment.

6.    The responsible parties have a duty to notify the Director of any actions taken to achieve compliance with the notice and order. For purposes of assessing civil penalties, a violation shall be considered ongoing until the responsible party has come into compliance with the notice and order and has notified the Director of this compliance, and an official inspection has verified compliance and all assessed penalties and costs have been paid to the City.

7.    a. Civil penalties will be waived by the Director or will be reimbursed to the payer by the Director, with the concurrence of the Administrative Services Director, under the following documented circumstances:

i.    The notice and order were issued in error; or

ii.    The civil penalties were assessed in error; or

iii.    Notice failed to reach the property owner due to unusual circumstances.

b.    Civil penalties accrued under subsection (D)(1) of this section will be reduced by the Director to 20 percent of accrued penalties if voluntary compliance is achieved and the City is reimbursed its reasonable staff and professional costs incurred in enforcing the notice and order.

8.    Deep Green Incentive Program.

a.    Failure to submit the supplemental reports required by SMC 20.50.630(F) by the date required – within six months and two years of issuance of the certificate of occupancy – is subject to civil penalties as specified in subsections (D)(1) and (D)(4) of this section. 

b.    If the project does not meet the requirements after two years of occupancy as detailed under SMC 20.50.630(F)(6)(a) through (c), the applicant or owner will be required to pay the following: 

i.    Failure to demonstrate compliance with the provisions contained in SMC 20.50.630(F)(6)(a) through (c) is subject to a maximum penalty of five percent of the construction value set forth in the building permit for the structure. This fee may be reduced at the discretion of the Director based on the extent of noncompliance.

ii.    In addition, the applicant or owner shall pay any permit or other fees that were waived by the City.

E.    Abatement.

1.    All public nuisances are subject to abatement under this subchapter.

2.    Imminent Nuisance and Summary Abatement. If a condition, substance, act or nuisance exists which causes a condition, the continued existence of which constitutes an immediate and emergent threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the City may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for the abatement, shall be given to the person responsible for the property and the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. The Director shall make the determination of a condition, substance, act or other occurrence constituting an imminent nuisance requiring summary abatement. Costs, both direct and indirect, of the abatement may be assessed as provided in this chapter.

3.    In the case of such unfit dwellings, buildings, structures, and premises or portions thereof, the Director, as an alternative to any other remedy provided in this subchapter, may abate such conditions by demolition, repair, removal, or securing the site and have abatement costs collected as taxes by the King County Treasury pursuant to SMC 20.30.775. If an occupied rental dwelling or its premises are declared unfit and required to be vacated by a notice and order, and the landlord fails to pay relocation assistance as set forth in RCW 59.18.085, the City shall advance relocation assistance funds to eligible tenants in accordance with RCW 59.18.085.

F.    Additional Enforcement Provisions. The enforcement provisions of this section are not exclusive, and may be used in addition to other enforcement provisions authorized by the Shoreline Municipal Code or by State law, including filing for injunctive relief or filing of a civil action. (Ord. 760 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 724 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 631 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2012; Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 466 § 2, 2007; Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 391 § 4, 2005; Ord. 251 § 2(D), 2000; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(c), 2000.

Eligible expenses shall include, but not be limited to, all costs for abatement whether or not the responsible party is identified, education and outreach, and one-time expenses associated with a specific case necessary for obtaining code compliance.

B.    The amount of cost of repairs, alterations or improvements; or vacating and closing; or removal or demolition by the Director shall be assessed against the real property upon which such cost was incurred unless such amount is previously paid. For the purposes of this section, the cost of vacating and closing shall include (1) the amount of relocation assistance payments advanced to the tenants under RCW 59.18.085 that a property owner has not repaid to the City, and (2) all penalties and interest that accrue as a result of the failure of the property owner to timely repay the amount of these relocation assistance payments under RCW 59.18.085.

Upon certification by the City Finance Director of the assessment amount being due and owing, the County Treasurer shall enter the amount of such assessment upon the tax rolls against the property for the current year and the same shall become a part of the general taxes for that year to be collected at the same time and with interest at such rates and in such manner as provided for in RCW 84.56.020, as now or hereafter amended, for delinquent taxes, and when collected to be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the City.

If the dwelling, building, structure, or premises is removed or demolished by the Director, the Director shall, if possible, sell the materials from such dwelling, building, structure, or premises and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and if there be any balance remaining, it shall be paid to the parties entitled thereto, as determined by the Director, after deducting the costs incident thereto.

The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property, which shall be of equal rank with State, county and municipal taxes.

C.    In addition to, or in lieu of, the provisions set forth in this subchapter, the City may commence a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect for any such charges incurred by the City to obtain compliance pursuant to this chapter and/or to collect any penalties that have been assessed. (Ord. 788 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 466 § 4, 2007; Ord. 391 § 4, 2005; Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(f), 2000).


20.30.780 Civil penalties.

Repealed by Ord. 391. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(g), 2000).


20.30.790 Appeals and judicial enforcement.

A.    Administrative Appeal – Filing Requirements.

1.    Any person named in a notice and order, or any owner of the land where the violation for which a notice and order is issued, may file a notice of appeal within 14 days of the service of the notice and order.

2.    A notice of appeal shall comply with the form, content and service requirements of SMC 20.30.220 and rules promulgated thereunder.

B.    Administrative Appeal – Procedures.

1.    The appeal hearing shall be conducted as provided for a Type B action under SMC 20.30.050 and Chapter 20.30, Subchapter 4, General Provisions for Land Use Hearings and Appeals, except that where specific provisions in that chapter conflict, the provisions of this section shall govern.

2.    Enforcement of any notice and order of the Director issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be stayed as to the appealing party during the pendency of any administrative appeal under this section, except when the Director determines that the violation poses a significant threat of immediate and/or irreparable harm and so states in any notice and order issued.

3.    Enforcement of any stop work order of the Director issued pursuant to this subchapter shall not be stayed during the pendency of any administrative appeal under this section.

4.    When multiple stop work orders or notices and orders have been issued for any set of facts constituting a violation, the enforcement actions appeal may be consolidated.

C.    Administrative Appeal – Final Order.

1.    Following review of the evidence submitted, the Hearing Examiner shall make written findings and conclusions and shall affirm or modify the notice and order previously issued if the examiner finds that a violation has occurred. The examiner shall uphold the appeal and reverse the order if the examiner finds that no violation has occurred.

2.    If an owner of property where a violation has occurred has affirmatively demonstrated that the violation was caused by another person or entity not the agent of the property owner and without the property owner’s knowledge or consent, such property owner shall be responsible only for abatement of the violation. Strict compliance with permit requirements may be waived regarding the performance of such an abatement in order to avoid doing substantial injustice to a nonculpable property owner.

3.    The Hearing Examiner’s final order shall be final and conclusive unless proceedings for review of the decision are properly commenced in superior court within the time period specified by State law. (Ord. 238 Ch. III § 10(h), 2000).

D.    Construction in MUR zones must achieve green building certification through one of the following protocols: Built Green 4-Star or PHIUS+. If an affordable housing or school project is required to certify through the Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard, this protocol shall fulfill the requirement. If a project utilizes a more stringent certification protocol through the Deep Green Incentive Program, this shall fulfill the requirement.

E.    All development within the MUR-70' zone that seeks additional height and alternative development standards shall be governed by a development agreement as provided in SMC 20.30.355. (Ord. 839 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 850 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 706 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.40.050 Special districts.

A.    Planned Area (PA). The purpose of the PA is to allow unique zones with regulations tailored to the specific circumstances, public priorities, or opportunities of a particular area that may not be appropriate in a City-wide land use district.

1.    Planned Area 3: Aldercrest (PA 3). Any development in PA 3 must comply with the standards specified in Chapter 20.93 SMC. 

B.    185th Street Light Rail Station Subarea Plan. The 185th Street Light Rail Station Subarea Plan establishes three zoning phases. Phase 1 zoning is delineated and shown on the City’s official zoning map. Phase 2 and 3 zoning is shown by an overlay. Property within the Phase 2 overlay will be automatically rezoned on March 1, 2021. Phase 3 will be automatically rezoned on March 1, 2033. (Ord. 706 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 654 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2013; Ord. 609 § 8, 2011; Ord. 598 § 5, 2011; Ord. 507 § 4, 2008; Ord. 492 § 4, 2008; Ord. 338 § 3, 2003; Ord. 281 § 5, 2001; Ord. 238 Ch. IV § 1(E), 2000).


20.40.060 Zoning map and zone boundaries.*

A.    The location and boundaries of zones defined by this chapter shall be shown and delineated on the official zoning map(s) of the City, which shall be maintained as such and which are hereby incorporated by reference as a part of this Code.

B.    Changes in the boundaries of the zones, shall be made by ordinance adopting or amending a zoning map.

C.    Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone, the following rules shall apply:

1.    Where boundaries are indicated as paralleling the approximate centerline of the street right-of-way, the zone shall extend to each adjacent boundary of the right-of-way. Non-road-related uses by adjacent property owners, if allowed in the right-of-way, shall meet the same zoning requirements regulating the property owners’ lots;

2.    Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, the actual lot lines shall be considered the boundaries;

3.    Where boundaries are indicated as following lines of ordinary high water, or government meander line, the lines shall be considered to be the actual boundaries. If these lines should change the boundaries shall be considered to move with them; and

4.    If none of the rules of interpretation described in subsections (C)(1) through (3) apply, then the zoning boundary shall be determined by map scaling.

D.    Classification of Rights-of-Way.

1.    Except when such areas are specifically designated on the zoning map as being classified in one of the zones provided in this title, land contained in rights-of-way for streets or alleys, or railroads, shall be considered unclassified.

2.    Within railroad rights-of-way, allowed uses shall be limited to tracks, signals or other operating devices, movement of rolling stock, utility lines and equipment, and facilities accessory to and used directly for the delivery and distribution of services to abutting property.

3.    Where such right-of-way is vacated, the vacated area shall have the zone classification of the adjoining property with which it is merged. (Ord. 352 § 1, 2004; Ord. 238 Ch. IV § 1(F), 2000).

*Code reviser’s note: The official Shoreline Zoning Map is on file at the offices of the City. Contact City Hall for more information.

Subchapter 2.

Permitted Uses


20.40.100 Purpose.

A.    The purpose of this subchapter is to establish the uses generally permitted in each zone which are compatible with the purpose of the zone and other uses allowed within the zone.

B.    The use of a property is defined by the activity for which the building or lot is intended, designed, arranged, occupied or maintained. 

C.    The use is considered permanently established when that use will be or has been legally established in continuous operation for a period exceeding 60 days. 

Exception to SMC 20.40.100(C): A use which will operate for less than 60 days or operates under an approved temporary use permit is considered a temporary use, and subject to the requirements of a temporary use permit.

D.    All applicable requirements of this Code, or other applicable State or Federal requirements, shall govern a use located in the City. (Ord. 731 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 238 Ch. IV § 2(A), 2000).


20.40.110 Use tables.

A.    The land use tables in this subchapter determine whether a specific use is allowed in a zone. The zone designation is located on the top of each column and the specific use is located on the horizontal rows.

B.    If no symbol appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is not allowed in that zone.

C.    If the letter “P” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is permitted in that zone.

D.    If the letter “C” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and row, the use is allowed subject to a conditional use permit.

E.    If the letter “S” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is allowed subject to a special use permit.

F.    If an “-i” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use may be allowed subject to the appropriate review process indicated above (P, C or S), the requirements of this Code, and the specific conditions indicated in the Index of Supplemental Use Criteria (SMC 20.40.200 through 20.40.610) for that type of use. 

G.    For the purposes of this Code, in most instances only broad use classifications that share similar characteristics are listed in the use tables. Where separate regulations or permit processes are necessary, uses are classified further. Some uses are identified with a detailed description provided in a referenced North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number. (This system classifies land uses by categories and provides subclassification for more detailed associated uses.) In case of a question as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use, which is not identified in these tables, the use shall not be permitted unless allowed through a Code interpretation applying the criteria for Unlisted Use found in the Index of Supplemental Use Criteria (SMC 20.40.200 through 20.40.610). Temporary uses are allowed under criteria listed in SMC 20.30.295.

H.    The Director is authorized to make reasonable accommodations to provisions of the Code that apply to dwellings occupied or to be occupied by disabled persons as defined by the Federal Fair Housing Act and Fair Housing Act Amendments, when such reasonable accommodations may be necessary in order to comply with such acts. All such accommodations shall be personal to the applicant and shall expire immediately if the disabled applicant terminates occupancy at the subject site.

I.    Where a zoning designation line divides a parcel which was in single ownership on August 17, 2015, and it contains more than one nonresidential zoning designation with no internal or abutting residential zoning designations, then any combination of the nonresidential zones’ allowed land uses shall be permitted throughout the entire parcel. All other development standards apply to each zone separately. See SMC 20.50.020(D) for more exceptions to lots with split zoning. (Ord. 722 § 1, 2015; Ord. 609 § 9, 2011; Ord. 425 § 2, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. IV § 2(B), 2000).

Exceptions to Table 20.50.020(1) and Table 20.50.020(2):

(1)    Repealed by Ord. 462.

(2)    These standards may be modified to allow unit lot developments, mixed single-family attached developments and zero lot line developments. Setback variations apply to internal lot lines only. Overall site must comply with setbacks, building coverage and hardscape limitations; limitations for individual lots may be modified.

(3)    For single-family detached development exceptions to front yard setback requirements, please see SMC 20.50.070.

(4)    For single-family detached development exceptions to rear and side yard setbacks, please see SMC 20.50.080.

(5)    For developments consisting of three or more dwellings located on a single parcel, the building setback shall be 15 feet along any property line abutting R-4 or R-6 zones. Please see SMC 20.50.160.

(6)    The maximum building coverage shall be 35 percent and the maximum hardscape area shall be 50 percent for single-family detached development located in the R-12 zone.

(7)    The base density for single-family detached dwellings on a single lot that is less than 14,400 square feet shall be calculated using a whole number, without rounding up.

(8)    For development on R-48 lots abutting R-12, R-18, R-24, R-48, NB, CB, MB, CZ and TC-1, 2 and 3 zoned lots, the maximum height allowed is 50 feet and may be increased to a maximum of 60 feet with the approval of a conditional use permit.

(9)    Base height for public and private K through 12 schools in all zoning districts except R-4 is 50 feet. Base height may be exceeded by gymnasiums to 55 feet and by theater fly spaces to 72 feet.

Exceptions to Table 20.50.020(3):

(1)    Front yards may be used for outdoor display of vehicles to be sold or leased.

(2)    Front yard setbacks, when in transition areas (SMC 20.50.021(A)) and across rights-of-way, shall be a minimum of 15 feet except on rights-of-way that are classified as principal arterials or when R-4, R-6, or R-8 zones have the Comprehensive Plan designation of Public Open Space.

(3)    The following structures may be erected above the height limits in all commercial zones:

a.    Roof structures housing or screening elevators, stairways, tanks, mechanical equipment required for building operation and maintenance, skylights, flagpoles, chimneys, utility lines, towers, and poles; provided, that no structure shall be erected more than 10 feet above the height limit of the district, whether such structure is attached or freestanding except as provided in subsection (3)(f) of these exceptions. WTF provisions (SMC 20.40.600) are not included in this exception.

b.    Parapets, firewalls, and railings shall be limited to four feet in height.

c.    Steeples, crosses, and spires when integrated as an architectural element of a building may be erected up to 18 feet above the base height of the district.

d.    Base height may be exceeded by gymnasiums to 55 feet and for theater fly spaces to 72 feet. 

e.    Solar energy collector arrays, small scale wind turbines, or other renewable energy equipment have no height limits.

f.    Base height may be exceeded by 15 feet for rooftop structures such as elevators, arbors, shelters, barbeque enclosures and other structures that provide open space amenities and their access.

(4)    Site hardscape shall not include the following:

a.    Areas of the site or roof covered by solar photovoltaic arrays or solar thermal collectors.

b.    Intensive vegetative roofing systems.

(5)    The exact setback along 145th Street, up to the maximum described in Table 20.50.020(2), will be determined by the Public Works Department through a development application.

B.    Base Density Calculation. The base density for an individual site shall be calculated by multiplying the site area (in acres) by the applicable number of dwelling units. When calculation results in a fraction, the fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number as follows:

1.    Fractions of 0.50 and above shall be rounded up except for lots less than 14,400 square feet in R-6 zones. See Exception (7) to Table 20.50.020(1).

2.    Fractions below 0.50 shall be rounded down.

    Example #1 – R-6 zone, 2.3-acre site: 2.3 x 6 = 13.8 The base density for this site would be 14 dwelling units.

    Example #2 – R-24 zone, 2.3-acre site: 2.3 x 24 = 55.2 The base density for the site would be 55 dwelling units.

    Example #3 – R-6 zone, 13,999-square-foot site: (13,999/43,560 = .3214 acres) so .3214 X 6 = 1.92. The base density for single-family detached dwellings on this site would be one unit.

    Example #4 – R-6 zone, 14,400-square-foot site (14,400/43,560 = .331 acres) so .331 X 6 = 1.986. The base density for the site would be two units.

3.    For development in the MUR zones: minimum density calculations resulting in a fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

C.    All areas of a site may be used in the calculation of base density (prior to any dedication for City facilities as required in Chapter 20.70 SMC), except that submerged lands shall not be credited toward base density calculations.

D.    When a lot is divided by a zone boundary, the following rules shall apply:

1.    When a lot contains both residential and nonresidential zoning, the zone boundary between the zones shall be considered a lot line for determining permitted building height and required setbacks on the site.

2.    When a lot contains residential zones of varying density, the following shall apply:

a.    Any residential density transfer within the lot shall be allowed from the portion with the lesser residential density to that of the greater residential density. 

b.    Residential density transfer from the higher density zone to the lower density zone may be allowed only when:

	•    	The transfer enhances the efficient use of needed infrastructure;

	•    	The transfer contributes to preservation of critical areas, or other natural features; and

	•    	The transfer does not result in significant adverse impacts to adjoining lower-density properties.

    Example: A development site is 3.8 acres. 1.5 acres is zoned R-12 and 2.3 acres is zoned R-24. The base density for the R-12 portion: 1.5 x 12 = 18 dwelling units, for the R-24 portion: 2.3 x 24 = 55.2 rounded to 55 dwelling units. The overall base density for the site is 18 + 55 = 73 dwelling units. (Ord. 871 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 850 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 833 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh.

A.    From abutting property, a 35-foot maximum building height for 25 feet horizontally from the required setback, then an additional 10 feet in height for the next 10 feet horizontally, and an additional 10 feet in height for each additional 10 horizontal feet up to the maximum height of the zone. From across street rights-of-way, a 35-foot maximum building height for 10 feet horizontally from the required building setback, then an additional 10 feet of height for the next 10 feet horizontally, and an additional 10 feet in height for each additional 10 horizontal feet, up to the maximum height allowed in the zone.

B.    Type I landscaping (SMC 20.50.460), significant tree preservation, and a solid, eight-foot, property line fence shall be required for transition area setbacks abutting R-4, R-6, or R-8 zones. Twenty percent of significant trees that are healthy without increasing the building setback shall be protected per SMC 20.50.370. The landscape area shall be a recorded easement that requires plant replacement as needed to meet Type I landscaping and required significant trees. Utility easements parallel to the required landscape area shall not encroach into the landscape area. Type II landscaping shall be required for transition area setbacks abutting rights-of-way directly across from R-4, R-6 or R-8 zones. Required tree species shall be selected to grow a minimum height of 50 feet. 

C.    All vehicular access to proposed development in nonresidential zones shall be from arterial classified streets, unless determined by the Director of Public Works to be technically not feasible or in conflict with State law addressing access to State highways. All developments in commercial zones shall conduct a transportation impact analysis per the Engineering Development Manual. Developments that create additional traffic that is projected to use nonarterial streets may be required to install appropriate traffic-calming measures. These additional measures will be identified and approved by the City’s Traffic Engineer.

D.    For development within the Aurora Square Community Renewal Area, maximum building height of 35 feet within the first 10 feet horizontally from the front yard setback line. No additional upper-story setback required. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 767 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 706 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 654 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2013; Ord. 609 § 10, 2011; Ord. 560 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009).


20.50.030 Lot width and lot area – Measurements.

A.    Lot width shall be measured by scaling a circle within the boundaries of the lot; provided, that any easement shall not be included within the circle.


[IMAGE]


Figure 20.50.030(A): Lot width measurement example.

B.    The lot area is the total horizontal land area contained within the boundaries of the lot. The minimum lot area is required to qualify as a building site. (Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 1(B-2), 2000).


20.50.040 Setbacks – Designation and measurement.

A.    The front yard setback is a required distance between the front property line to a building line (line parallel to the front line), measured across the full width of the lot. 

    Front yard setback on irregular lots or on interior lots fronting on a dead-end private access road shall be designated by the Director.

B.    Each lot must contain only one front yard setback and one rear yard setback except lots abutting two or more streets, as illustrated in the Shoreline Development Code Figure 20.50.040(C).



C.    The rear and side yard setbacks shall be defined in relation to the designated front yard setback.
[IMAGE]


 

Figure 20.50.040(C): Examples of lots and required yards.

D.    The rear yard setback is a required distance from the rear lot line to a line parallel to and measured perpendicularly from the rear lot line. (Rear lot line is the line opposite and/or most distant from the front line.) 

E.    The side yard setback is a distance measured from any side lot line to a line parallel to that line and that extends from the front yard setback line to the rear yard, front yard (on corner lots), or another side yard setback line.

F.    Allowance for Optional Aggregate Setback. For lots with unusual geometry, flag lots with undesignated setbacks, or site conditions, such as critical areas, an existing cluster of significant trees, or other unique natural or historic features that should be preserved without disturbance, the City may reduce the individual required setbacks; however, the total of setbacks shall be no less than the sum of the minimum front yard, rear yard, and side yards setbacks. In order to exercise this option, the City must determine that a public benefit is gained by relaxing any setback standard. The following criteria shall apply:

1.    No rear or side yard setback shall be less than five feet.

2.    The front yard setback adjacent to street shall be no less than 15 feet in R-4 and R-6 and 10 feet in all other zones. (See Exception 20.50.070(1).)


[IMAGE]


Figure 20.50.040(F): Example of optional aggregate setback to preserve a cluster of significant trees.

G.    Setbacks – Adjoining Half-Street or Designated Arterial.

1.    In addition to providing the required yard setback, a lot adjoining a half-street or designated arterial shall provide additional width of yard setback sufficient to accommodate construction of the planned half-street or arterial.

H.    Setbacks from Regional Utility Corridors.

1.    In subdivisions and short subdivisions, areas used as regional utility corridors shall be contained in separate tracts.

2.    In other types of land development permits, easements shall be used to delineate such corridors.

3.    All buildings and structures shall maintain a minimum distance of five feet from property or easement lines delineating the boundary of regional utility corridors, except for utility structures necessary to the operation of the utility corridor.

I.    Projections into Setback.

1.    Projections may extend into required yard setbacks as follows, except that no projections shall be allowed into any five-foot yard setback except:

a.    Gutters;

b.    Fixtures not exceeding three square feet in area (e.g., overflow pipes for sprinkler and hot water tanks, gas and electric meters, alarm systems, and air duct termination; i.e., dryer, bathroom, and kitchens); or

c.    On-site drainage systems.

d.    Where allowed by the International Building Code and International Fire Code minimum fire separation distance requirements, required yard setback distance from adjacent property lines may be decreased by a maximum of four inches for the sole purpose of adding insulation to the exterior of the existing building structural frame. Existing buildings not conforming to development standards shall not extend into required yard setback more than what would be allowed for a conforming structure under this exception.

e.    Rain barrels, cisterns and other rainwater catchment systems may extend into a required yard setback according to the following:

i.    Cisterns, rain barrels or other rainwater catchment systems no greater than 600 gallons shall be allowed to encroach into a required yard setback if each cistern is less than four feet wide and less than four and one-half feet tall excluding piping.

ii.    Cisterns or rainwater catchment systems larger than 600 gallons may be permitted in required yard setbacks provided that they do not exceed 10 percent coverage in any required yard setback, and they are not located closer than two and one-half feet from a side or rear lot line, or 15 feet from the front lot line. If located in a front yard setback, materials and design must be compatible with the architectural style of the building which it serves, or otherwise adequately screened, as determined by the Director.

iii.    Cisterns may not impede requirements for lighting, open space, fire protection or egress.

2.    Fireplace structures, bay or garden windows, balconies (including Juliet balconies), enclosed stair landings, closets, or similar structures may project into required setbacks, except into any five-foot yard required setback, provided such projections are:

a.    Limited to two per facade;

b.    Not wider than 10 feet;

c.    Not more than 24 inches into a side yard setback; or

d.    Not more than 30 inches into a front and rear yard setback.

Single-family attached and mixed single-family attached developments subject to Subchapter 3 may have eaves encroach up to 18 inches into a required five-foot setback.

4.    Uncovered porches and decks not exceeding 18 inches above the finished grade may project to the front, rear, and side property lines.

5.    Uncovered porches and decks, which exceed 18 inches above the finished grade, may project five feet into the required front, rear and side yard setbacks but not within five feet of a property line.

6.    Entrances with covered but unenclosed porches may project up to 60 square feet into the front and rear yard setback, but shall not be allowed into any five-foot yard setback.

7.    For the purpose of retrofitting an existing residence, uncovered building stairs or ramps no more than 44 inches wide may project to the property line subject to right-of-way sight distance requirements.

8.    Landscape structures are allowed in required yard setbacks if they meet the following provisions:

a.    No more than a 40-square-foot footprint, including eaves;

b.    A maximum height of eight feet;

c.    All sides shall be at least 50 percent open, or, if latticework is used, there shall be a minimum opening of two inches between crosspieces;

d.    Vegetation supported by a landscape structure may grow over the maximum height, subject to the sight clearance provisions in the Engineering Development Manual.

9.    No projections are allowed into a regional utility corridor.

10.    No projections are allowed into an access easement. (Ord. 871 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 850 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 767 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 724 § 1 (Exh.

Exception 20.50.050(1): The ridge of a pitched roof on the principal house in R-4 and R-6 zones may extend up to 35 feet; provided, that all parts of the roof above 30 feet must be pitched at a rate of not less than three to 12.

Exception 20.50.050(2): The ridge of a pitched roof on the building in the R-18 through R-48 zones may extend up to 40 feet; provided, that all parts of the roof above 35 feet must be pitched at a rate of not less than four to 12. (For further exceptions to height limits in the R-48 zone, see Exceptions 20.50.020(8) and (9).)

Exception 20.50.050(3): The following structures may be erected above the height limits in residential zones:

•    Roof structures housing or screening elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, or similar equipment required for building operation and maintenance;

•    Renewable energy systems such as solar collectors and small scale wind generators are allowed an additional 15 feet above the height limit of the zone when camouflaged to the greatest extent possible;

•    Fire or parapet walls, skylights, flagpoles, chimneys, and utility line towers and poles; and

•    Steeples, crosses, and spires when integrated as an architectural element of a building.

•    The maximum allowable roof height may be increased by eight inches, only for the purpose of adding insulation to the exterior of the existing building structural frame. Existing buildings not conforming to development standards shall not exceed the maximum allowable height limit by more than what would be allowed for a conforming structure under this exception. The Director may prohibit additional roof height encroachments in view-sensitive areas. (Ord. 669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 663 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2013; Ord. 352 § 1, 2004; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 1(B-4), 2000).



Subchapter 2.

Single-Family Detached Residential Design Standards 


20.50.060 Purpose.

The purpose of this subchapter is to establish design standards for single-family detached residential development as follows:

A.    To ensure that the physical characteristics of new houses through infill development are compatible with the character and scale of surrounding area, and provide adequate light, air, privacy, and open space for each house. 

B.    To establish a well-defined single-family residential streetscape by setting back houses for a depth that allows for landscaped front yard. 

C.    To reduce the visual impact of garages from the street views. (Ord. 238 Ch. V § 2(A), 2000).


20.50.070 Site planning – Front yard setback – Standards.

The front yard setback requirements are specified in Subchapter 1 of this chapter, Dimensions and Density for Development, except as provided for below.

For individual garage or carport units, at least 20 linear feet of driveway shall be provided between any garage, carport entrance and the property line abutting the street, measured along the centerline of the driveway. 

Exception 20.50.070(1): The front yard setback may be reduced to the average front setback of the two adjacent lots, provided the applicant demonstrates by survey that the average setback of adjacent houses is less than 20 feet. However, in no case shall an averaged setback of less than 15 feet be allowed. If the subject lot is a corner lot, the setback may be reduced to the average setback of the lot abutting the proposed house on the same street and the 20 feet required setback. (This provision shall not be construed as requiring a greater front yard setback than 20 feet.)
[IMAGE]


Figure Exception to 20.50.070(1): Minimum front yard setback (c) may be reduced to the average setback of houses located on adjacent lots (a and b).

Calculation: c (min) = (a +b) / 2.

Exception 20.50.070(2): The required front yard setback may be reduced to 15 feet provided there is no curb cut or driveway on the street and vehicle access is from another street or an alley.

Subchapter 5.

Tree Conservation, Land Clearing and Site Grading Standards


20.50.290 Purpose.

The purpose of this subchapter is to reduce the environmental impacts of site development while promoting the reasonable use of land in the City by addressing the following:

A.    Prevention of damage to property, harm to persons, and environmental impacts caused by excavations, fills, and the destabilization of soils;

B.    Protection of water quality from the adverse impacts associated with erosion and sedimentation;

C.    Promotion of building and site planning practices that are consistent with the City’s natural topography and vegetative cover;

D.    Preservation and enhancement of trees and vegetation which contribute to the visual quality and economic value of development in the City and provide continuity and screening between developments;

E.    Protection of critical areas from the impacts of clearing and grading activities;

F.    Conservation and restoration of trees and vegetative cover to reduce flooding, the impacts on existing drainageways, and the need for additional stormwater management facilities; 

G.    Protection of anadromous fish and other native animal and plant species through performance-based regulation of clearing and grading;

H.    Retention of tree clusters for the abatement of noise, wind protection, and mitigation of air pollution;

I.    Rewarding significant tree protection efforts by granting flexibility for certain other development requirements;

J.    Providing measures to protect trees that may be impacted during construction;

K.    Promotion of prompt development, effective erosion control, and restoration of property following site development; and

L.    Replacement of trees removed during site development in order to achieve a goal of no net loss of tree cover throughout the City over time. (Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 5(A), 2000).


20.50.300 General requirements.

A.    Tree cutting or removal by any means is considered a type of clearing and is regulated subject to the limitations and provisions of this subchapter.

B.    All land clearing and site grading shall comply with all standards and requirements adopted by the City of Shoreline. Where a Development Code section or related manual or guide contains a provision that is more restrictive or specific than those detailed in this subchapter, the more restrictive provision shall apply.

C.    Permit Required. No person shall conduct clearing or grading activities on a site without first obtaining the appropriate permit approved by the Director, unless specifically exempted by SMC 20.50.310.

D.    When clearing or grading is planned in conjunction with development that is not exempt from the provisions of this subchapter, all of the required application materials for approval of tree removal, clearing and rough grading of the site shall accompany the development application to allow concurrent review.

E.    A clearing and grading permit may be issued for developed land if the regulated activity is not associated with another development application on the site that requires a permit.

F.    Replacement trees planted under the requirements of this subchapter on any parcel in the City of Shoreline shall be regulated as protected trees under SMC 20.50.330(D).

G.    Any disturbance to vegetation within critical areas and their corresponding buffers is subject to the procedures and standards contained within the critical areas chapter of the Shoreline Development Code, Chapter 20.80 SMC, Critical Areas, in addition to the standards of this subchapter. The standards which result in the greatest protection of the critical areas shall apply. (Ord. 640 § 1 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 406 § 1, 2006; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 5(B), 2000).

A.    Complete Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from the provisions of this subchapter and do not require a permit:

1.    Emergency situation on private property involving danger to life or property or substantial fire hazards.

a.    Statement of Purpose. Retention of significant trees and vegetation is necessary in order to utilize natural systems to control surface water runoff, reduce erosion and associated water quality impacts, reduce the risk of floods and landslides, maintain fish and wildlife habitat and preserve the City’s natural, wooded character. Nevertheless, when certain trees become unstable or damaged, they may constitute a hazard requiring cutting in whole or part. Therefore, it is the purpose of this section to provide a reasonable and effective mechanism to minimize the risk to human health and property while preventing needless loss of healthy, significant trees and vegetation, especially in critical areas and their buffers.

b.    For purposes of this section, “Director” means the Director of the Department and their designee.

c.    In addition to other exemptions of SMC 20.50.290 through 20.50.370, a request for the cutting of any tree that is an active and imminent hazard such as tree limbs or trunks that are demonstrably cracked, leaning toward overhead utility lines or structures, or are uprooted by flooding, heavy winds or storm events. After the tree removal, the City will need photographic proof or other documentation and the appropriate application approval, if any. The City retains the right to dispute the emergency and require that the party obtain a clearing permit and/or require that replacement trees be replanted as mitigation.

2.    Removal of trees and/or ground cover by the City and/or utility provider in situations involving immediate danger to life or property, substantial fire hazards, or interruption of services provided by a utility. The City retains the right to dispute the emergency and require that the party obtain a clearing permit and/or require that replacement trees be replanted as mitigation.

3.    Installation and regular maintenance of public utilities, under direction of the Director, except substation construction and installation or construction of utilities in parks or environmentally critical areas.

4.    Cemetery graves involving less than 50 cubic yards of excavation, and related fill per each cemetery plot.

Exception 20.50.350(B):

1.    The Director may allow a reduction in the minimum significant tree retention percentage to facilitate preservation of a greater number of smaller trees, a cluster or grove of trees, contiguous perimeter buffers, distinctive skyline features, or based on the City’s concurrence with a written recommendation of an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or by the American Society of Consulting Arborists as a registered consulting arborist that retention of the minimum percentage of trees is not advisable on an individual site; or

2.    In addition, the Director may allow a reduction in the minimum significant tree retention percentage if all of the following criteria are satisfied: The exception is necessary because:

	•    	There are special circumstances related to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property.

	•    	Strict compliance with the provisions of this Code may jeopardize reasonable use of property.

	•    	Proposed vegetation removal, replacement, and any mitigation measures are consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations.

	•    	The granting of the exception or standard reduction will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity.

3.    If an exception is granted to this standard, the applicant shall still be required to meet the basic tree replacement standards identified in SMC 20.50.360 for all significant trees removed beyond the minimum allowed per parcel without replacement and up to the maximum that would ordinarily be allowed under SMC 20.50.350(B). 

4.    In addition, the applicant shall be required to plant four trees for each significant tree removed that would otherwise count towards the minimum retention percentage. Trees replaced under this provision shall be at least 12 feet high for conifers and three inches in caliper if otherwise. This provision may be waived by the Director for restoration enhancement projects conducted under an approved vegetation management plan.

5.    The Director may not require the retention of a significant tree that must be removed to accommodate the installation of a frontage improvement required as a condition of permit approval pursuant to SMC 20.70.320 when the applicant and the City demonstrate that a reasonable effort has been made to retain the significant tree. If approved for removal, this tree shall not be included in calculation of the minimum retention percentage for the site. 

C.    Incentives for Higher Levels of Tree Protection. The Director may grant reductions or adjustments to other site development standards if the protection levels identified in subsection B of this section are exceeded. On a case-by-case review, the Director shall determine the balance between tree protection that exceeds the established minimum percentage and variations to site development requirements. If the Director grants adjustments or reductions to site development standards under this provision, then tree protection requirements shall be recorded on the face of the plat, as a notice to title, or on some other legal document that runs with the property. Adjustments that may be considered are:

1.    Reductions or variations of the area, width, or composition of required open space and/or landscaping;

2.    Variations in parking lot design and/or any access driveway requirements;

3.    Variations in building setback requirements;

4.    Variations of grading and stormwater requirements.

D.    Site Design. Site improvements shall be designed and constructed to meet the following:

1.    Site improvements shall be designed to give priority to protection of trees with the following characteristics, functions, or location including where the critical root zone of trees on adjoining property is within five feet of the development:

a.    Existing stands of healthy trees that have a reasonable chance of survival once the site is developed, are well shaped to withstand the wind and maintain stability over the long term, and will not pose a threat to life or property.

b.    Trees which exceed 50 feet in height.

c.    Trees and tree clusters which form a continuous canopy.

d.    Trees that create a distinctive skyline feature.

e.    Trees that have a screening function or provide relief from glare, blight, commercial or industrial harshness.

f.    Trees providing habitat value, particularly riparian habitat.

g.    Trees within the required yard setbacks or around the perimeter of the proposed development.

h.    Trees having a significant land stability function.

i.    Trees adjacent to public parks, open space, and critical area buffers.

j.    Trees having a significant water-retention function.

3.    Building footprints, parking areas, roadways, utility corridors and other structures shall be designed and located with a consideration of tree protection opportunities.

4.    The project grading plans shall accommodate existing trees and avoid alteration to grades around existing significant trees to be retained.

5.    Required open space and recreational space shall be designed and located to protect existing stands of trees.

6.    The site design and landscape plans shall provide suitable locations and adequate area for replacement trees as required in SMC 20.50.360.

7.    In considering trees for protection, the applicant shall avoid selecting trees that may become hazardous because of wind gusts, including trees adjacent to utility corridors where falling trees may cause power outages or other damage. Remaining trees may be susceptible to blow downs because of loss of a buffer from other trees, grade changes affecting the tree health and stability and/or the presence of buildings in close proximity. 

8.    If significant trees have been removed from a closed, forested situation, an adequate buffer of smaller trees shall be retained or planted on the fringe of such significant trees as determined by a certified arborist.

9.    All trees located outside of identified building footprints and driveways and at least 10 feet from proposed structures shall be considered as eligible for preservation. However, all significant trees on a site shall be considered when calculating the minimum retention percentage.

20.50.500 Internal landscaping for parking area.

Required parking area landscaping shall include landscape areas that are located in areas within or adjacent to parking areas. However, landscaping designed to meet perimeter landscaping requirements cannot also be used to meet parking lot landscaping requirements.

A.    Multifamily developments with common parking areas shall provide planting areas in parking lots at a rate of 20 square feet per parking stall.

B.    Commercial, office, industrial or institutional developments shall provide landscaping at a rate of:

1.    Twenty square feet per parking stall when 10 to 30 parking stalls are provided; or

C.    Trees shall be provided and distributed throughout the parking area at a rate of one tree for every 10 parking stalls.

D.    Permanent curbs or structural barriers shall be provided to protect shrubs and trees from vehicle bumpers. Landscaping under vehicle overhang shall not be included in required landscape area calculations.

E.    Parking area landscaping shall require:

1.    At least 60 square feet with a lineal dimension of no less than four feet;

2.    Shrubs planted from five-gallon containers or at 24 inches in height and spaced no more than four feet apart on center;

3.    Ground covers planted from minimally four-inch pots and spaced no more than 18 inches apart;

4.    Trees planted at least 1.5 inches caliper in size;

5.    Gaps in curbs are allowed for stormwater runoff; and

6.    Natural drainage landscapes (such as rain gardens, biofiltration swales and bioretention planters) when designed in compliance with the stormwater design manual. (Ord. 669 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 654 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2013; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 7(B-5), 2000).


20.50.510 Alternative landscape design.

Alternative landscape designs may be allowed, subject to City approval, if the design accomplishes equal or better levels of Type I or II landscaping. 

A.    The average width of the perimeter landscape area may be reduced 25 percent along interior property lines where:

1.    Berms at least three feet in height (2:1 slope) or walls and fences at least six feet in height are incorporated into the landscape design; or

2.    Plant material that would be required is located elsewhere on site.

B.    When an existing structure precludes installation of the required site perimeter landscape area then the plant material shall be incorporated on another portion of the site. (Ord. 238 Ch. V § 7(B-6), 2000).


20.50.520 General standards for landscape installation and maintenance.

A.    Berms shall not exceed a slope of two horizontal feet to one vertical foot (2:1).

B.    All new turf areas, except all-weather or sand-based athletic fields, shall be augmented with a two-inch layer of organic material cultivated a minimum of six inches deep or have an organic content of five percent or more to a depth of six inches. 

C.    Except as specifically outlined for turf areas in subsection (B) of this section, the organic content of soils in any landscape area shall be as necessary to provide adequate nutrient and moisture-retention levels for the establishment of plantings.

D.    Landscape areas, except turf or areas of established ground cover, shall be covered with at least two inches of mulch to minimize evaporation.

E.    Plant selection shall consider adaptability to climatic, geologic, and topographical conditions of the site. Preservation of existing vegetation is encouraged.

F.    All plants shall conform to American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) grades and standards as published in the “American Standard for Nursery Stock” manual; provided, that existing healthy vegetation used to augment new plantings shall not be required to meet the standards of this manual.

G.    Multiple-stemmed trees shall be permitted as an option to single-stemmed trees; provided, that such multiple-stemmed trees are at least 10 feet in height and not allowed within street rights-of-way.

H.    When the width of any landscape strip is 20 feet or greater, the required trees shall be staggered to avoid the appearance of a single row of trees.

I.    All fences shall be placed on the inward side of any required perimeter landscaping when adjacent to a public right-of-way and on the outward side of the required landscaping or on the property line when adjacent to private property.

J.    Required street landscaping may be placed within Washington State rights-of-way subject to permission of the Washington State Department of Transportation.

K.    New landscape material shall be indigenous plant species within areas of undisturbed vegetation, within critical areas or their buffers or within the protected area of significant trees; provided, that pesticide and chemical fertilizer may be restricted within these landscaped areas.

L.    All landscaping shall be installed according to sound horticultural practices in a manner designed to encourage quick establishment and healthy plant growth. All landscaping shall either be installed or the installation shall be secured with a letter of credit, escrow, or performance bond for 125 percent of the value of the landscaping prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building in such phase.

M.    Trees and vegetation, fences, walls and other landscape elements shall be considered as elements of the project in the same manner as parking, building materials and other site details. The applicant, landowner or successors in interest shall be responsible for the regular maintenance of all landscaping elements in good condition. 

N.    Applicants shall provide a landscape maintenance and replacement agreement to the City prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

O.    Landscape plans and utility plans shall be coordinated. The placement of trees and large shrubs shall accommodate the location of required utilities both above and below ground. Location of plants and trees shall be based on the mature canopy and root zone. Root zone shall be determined using the International Society of Arboriculture’s recommended calculation for identifying tree protection area. Mature tree and shrub canopies may not reach an aboveground utility such as street lights and power lines. Mature tree and shrub root zones may overlap utility trenches as long as 80 percent of the root zone is unaffected.

P.    Adjustment of plant location does not reduce the number of plants required for landscaping.

Q.    Sight distance triangle for visual clearances shall be established and maintained. The criteria for sight distance and visual clearances are contained in and consistent with the Engineering Development Guide for all driveway exits and entrances and street corners. (Ord. 591 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 7(B-7), 2000).

Subchapter 8.

Signs


20.50.530 Purpose.

The purposes of this subchapter are:

A.    To provide standards for the effective use of signs as a means of identification that enhances the aesthetics of business properties and economic viability.

B.    To protect the public interest and safety by minimizing the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby properties and traffic safety.

C.    To establish regulations for the type, number, location, size, and lighting of signs that are complementary with the building use and compatible with their surroundings. (Ord. 654 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2013; Ord. 299 § 1, 2002; Ord. 238 Ch. V § 8(A), 2000).


20.50.532 Permit required.

A.    Except as provided in this chapter, no temporary or permanent sign may be constructed, installed, posted, displayed or modified without first obtaining a sign permit approving the proposed sign’s size, design, location, and display.

B.    No permit is required for normal and ordinary maintenance and repair, and changes to the graphics, symbols, or copy of a sign, without affecting the size, structural design or height. Exempt changes to the graphics, symbols or copy of a sign must meet the standards for permitted illumination. 

C.    Installation or replacement of electronic changing message or reader board signs requires a permit and must comply with Exception 20.50.550(A)(2) and SMC 20.50.590. 

D.    Sign applications that propose to depart from the standards of this subchapter must receive an administrative design review approval under SMC 20.30.297 for all signs on the property as a comprehensive signage package.

E.    Applications for property located within the Aurora Square Community Renewal Area, as defined by Resolution 333, shall be subject to SMC 20.50.620. (Ord. 712 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 695 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 654 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2013).


20.50.535 Thresholds – Required site improvements.

Repealed by Ord. 654. (Ord. 581 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2010; Ord. 515 § 1, 2008; Ord. 299 § 1, 2002).

B.    Private Signs on City Right-of-Way. No private signs shall be located partially or completely in a public right-of-way unless a right-of-way permit has been approved consistent with Chapter 12.15 SMC and is allowed under SMC 20.50.540 through 20.50.610.

C.    Sign Copy Area. Calculation of sign area shall use rectangular areas that enclose each portion of the signage such as words, logos, graphics, and symbols other than nonilluminated background. Sign area for signs that project out from a building or are perpendicular to street frontage are measured on one side even though both sides can have copy.

D.    Building Addresses. Building addresses should be installed on all buildings consistent with SMC 20.70.250(C) and will not be counted as sign copy area.

E.    Materials and Design. All signs, except temporary signs, must be constructed of durable, maintainable materials. Signs that are made of materials that deteriorate quickly or that feature impermanent construction are not permitted for permanent signage. For example, plywood or plastic sheets without a sign face overlay or without a frame to protect exposed edges are not permitted for permanent signage.

F.    Illumination. Where illumination is permitted per Table 20.50.540(G) the following standards must be met:

1.    Channel lettering or individual backlit letters mounted on a wall, or individual letters placed on a raceway, where light only shines through the copy.

2.    Opaque cabinet signs where light only shines through copy openings.

3.    Shadow lighting, where letters are backlit, but light only shines through the edges of the copy.

4.    Neon signs.

5.    All external light sources illuminating signs shall be less than six feet from the sign and shielded to prevent direct lighting from entering adjacent property.

2.    Private Signs on City Right-of-Way. No private signs shall be located partially or completely in a public right-of-way unless a right-of-way permit has been approved consistent with Chapter 12.15 SMC and is allowed under SMC 20.50.540 through 20.50.610.

3.    Sign Copy Area. Calculation of sign area shall use rectangular areas that enclose each portion of the signage such as words, logos, graphics, and symbols other than nonilluminated background. Sign area for signs that project out from a building or are perpendicular to street frontage are measured on one side even though both sides can have copy.

4.    Building Addresses. Building addresses should be installed on all buildings consistent with SMC 20.70.250(C) and will not be counted as sign copy area.

5.    Materials and Design. All signs, except temporary signs, must be constructed of durable, maintainable materials. Signs that are made of materials that deteriorate quickly or that feature impermanent construction are not permitted for permanent signage. For example, plywood or plastic sheets without a sign face overlay or without a frame to protect exposed edges are not permitted for permanent signage.

6.    CRA Signage Design Guidelines. Design and content of the CRA pylon, CRA monument, and CRA wayfinding sign posts shall conform to the CRA signage design guidelines. In addition, all other permanent or temporary signage or advertising displaying the common name, logo, colors, taglines, or fonts of the CRA lifestyle center shall comply with the CRA signage design guidelines.

7.    Illumination. Where illumination is permitted per Table 20.50.620.E.8 the following standards must be met:

a.    Channel lettering or individual backlit letters mounted on a wall, or individual letters placed on a raceway, where light only shines through the copy.

b.    Opaque cabinet signs where light only shines through copy openings.

c.    Shadow lighting, where letters are backlit, but light only shines through the edges of the copy.

d.    Neon signs.

e.    All external light sources illuminating signs shall be less than six feet from the sign and shielded to prevent direct lighting from entering adjacent property.

f.    EMC messages shall be monochromatic. EMCs shall be equipped with technology that automatically dims the EMC according to light conditions, ensuring that EMCs do not exceed 0.3 foot-candles over ambient lighting conditions when measured at the International Sign Association’s recommended distance, based on the EMC size. EMC message hold time shall be 10 seconds with dissolve transitions. Ten percent of each hour shall advertise civic, community, educational, or cultural events. 

g.    Building perimeter/outline lighting is allowed for theaters only.

20.60.140 Adequate streets.

The purpose of this chapter is to set forth specific standards providing for the City’s compliance with the concurrency requirements of the State Growth Management Act (GMA), Chapter 36.70A RCW. The GMA requires that adequate transportation capacity is provided concurrently with development to handle the increased traffic projected to result from growth and development in the City. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the City’s transportation system shall be adequate to serve the future development at the time the development is available for occupancy without decreasing current service levels below established minimum standards.

A.    Level of Service. The level of service standard that the City has selected as the basis for measuring concurrency is as follows: 

1.    LOS D at signalized intersections on arterial streets and at unsignalized intersecting arterials; and

2.    A volume to capacity (V/C) ratio of 0.90 or lower for principal and minor arterials.

    The V/C ratio on one leg of an intersection may exceed 0.90 when the intersection operates at LOS D or better.

    These level of service standards apply throughout the City unless an alternative level of service for a particular street or streets has been adopted in the Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element. 

3.    Pedestrian and bicycle LOS within the Station Subareas shall be LOS D or better.

    Pedestrian level of service (LOS) shall be evaluated for each direction along all arterial streets within a quarter mile radius of the light rail station. Pedestrian LOS for sidewalks shall be evaluated using Steps 6 and 7 from the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010, Chapter 17. In the absence of sidewalks, pedestrian LOS shall be determined using Exhibit 17-4 from the HCM. Each link within the quarter mile radius shall be evaluated. For questions regarding link boundaries, contact the City Traffic Engineer.

B.    Development Proposal Requirements. All new proposals for development that would generate 20 or more new trips during the p.m. peak hour must submit a transportation impact analysis prepared by the applicant in accordance with the standards established in the City’s Engineering Development Manual at the time of application. The estimate of the number of trips for a development shall be consistent with the most recent edition of the Trip Generation Manual, published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers.

1.    The traffic impact analysis shall include, at a minimum, an analysis of the following: 

a.    An analysis of origin/destination trip distribution proposed;

b.    The identification of any intersection that would receive the addition of 20 or more trips during the p.m. peak hour; and

c.    An analysis demonstrating how impacted intersections could accommodate the additional trips and maintain the LOS standard.

2.    If the traffic impact analysis identifies one or more intersections at which the adopted LOS standards are exceeded, the applicant shall mitigate the impacts in order to achieve and maintain the adopted LOS standard.

C.    Concurrency Requirement. The City shall not issue a building permit until:

1.    A concurrency test has been conducted and passed; or

2.    The building permit has been determined to be one of the following that are exempt from the concurrency test:

a.    Alteration or replacement of an existing residential structure that does not create an additional dwelling unit or change the type of dwelling unit.

b.    Alteration or replacement of an existing nonresidential structure that does not expand the usable space or change the existing land use as defined in the land use categories as set forth in the impact fee analysis land use tables.

c.    Miscellaneous improvements that do not generate increased need for public facilities, including, but not limited to, fences, walls, residential swimming pools, and signs.

d.    Demolition or moving of a structure.

e.    Any building permit for development that creates no additional impacts, insignificant and/or temporary additional impacts on any transportation facility, including, but not limited to:

i.    Home occupations that do not generate any additional demand for transportation facilities;

ii.    Special events permits;

iii.    Temporary structures not exceeding a total of 30 days.

f.    Any building permit issued to development that is vested to receive a building permit pursuant to RCW 19.27.095.

D.    Available Capacity for Concurrency.

1.    The City shall determine the available capacity for concurrency as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section and record it in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet.

2.    The City shall update the available capacity in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet within 12 months of any of the events listed below:

a.    Update or amendment of the City’s transportation element as it relates to concurrency management. 

b.    Total traffic volume increases by 30 percent compared to traffic volume at the time the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet was created, or was updated with new data from the traffic model.

c.    More than 50 percent of the available capacity in the most recent calculation of available capacity has been reserved as a result of concurrency tests conducted by the City.

3.    If none of the events listed in subsection (D)(2) of this section occurs within seven years of the most recent calculation of the available capacity, the City will update the available capacity recorded in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet. 

4.    Each update of available capacity in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet shall carry forward the reservations of capacity for any building permits for development that has not been completed prior to the update of available capacity. 

5.    In order to monitor the cumulative effect of exemptions from the concurrency test on the available capacity, the City shall adjust the available capacity in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet to record the number of p.m. peak hour trips generated by exempt building permits in the same manner as though a concurrency test had been performed for the exempt building permits.

E.    Concurrency Test.

1.    Each applicant for a building permit that is not exempt from the concurrency test as provided in subsection (C)(2) of this section shall submit the type of development to be constructed pursuant to the building permit, the number of square feet of each type of development, and the number of dwelling units. 

2.    The City shall perform a concurrency test for each application for a building permit that is not exempt from the concurrency test. 

3.    The concurrency test is passed if the number of trips from an applicant’s proposed development is equal to or less than available capacity in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet that has been adjusted to subtract reserved trips. If the concurrency test is passed the City shall record the concurrency test results in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet in order to reduce the available capacity by the number of trips that will be generated by the applicant’s development. The reservation of capacity shall be valid for the same time as the building permit for which it was reserved.

4.    The concurrency test is not passed if the number of trips from an applicant’s proposed development is greater than available capacity after it has been adjusted to subtract reserved trips. If the concurrency test is not passed, the applicant may select one of the following options:

a.    Amend the application to reduce the number of trips generated by the proposed development; or

b.    Provide system improvements or strategies that increase the City-wide available capacity by enough trips so that the application will pass the concurrency test; or

c.    Appeal the denial of the application for a concurrency test, pursuant to the provisions of subsection H of this section.

5.    The City shall conduct concurrency tests for multiple applications impacting the same portions of the transportation network/intersection chronologically in accord with the date each application was deemed complete pursuant to SMC 20.30.110.

6.    A concurrency test, and any results, shall be administrative actions of the City that are categorically exempt from the State Environmental Policy Act.

F.    Reservation of Availability Capacity Results of Concurrency Test.

1.    Upon passage of a concurrency test, the City shall reserve capacity on behalf of the applicant in the concurrency trip capacity balance sheet.

2.    A reservation of available capacity shall be valid for the same period as the approved building permit for which it was made, and may be extended according to the same terms and conditions as the underlying building permit.

3.    A reservation of available capacity is valid only for the uses and intensities authorized for the building permit for which it is issued. Any change in use or intensity is subject to an additional concurrency test of the incremental increase in impact on transportation facilities.

4.    A reservation of available capacity is nontransferable to another parcel of land or development proposal. A reservation of available capacity may be transferred to a subsequent purchaser of the land for the same uses and intensities. 

5.    A reservation of available capacity shall expire if the underlying building permit expires, the application or permit is withdrawn by the applicant, the permit is revoked by the City, application approval is denied by the City, or the determination of completeness expires.

G.    Fees.

1.    The City shall charge each applicant for a building permit that is not exempt from this section a concurrency test fee in an amount to be established by resolution by the City Council. 

2.    The City shall charge a processing fee to any individual that requests an informal analysis of capacity if the requested analysis requires substantially the same research as a concurrency test. The amount of the processing fee shall be the same as the concurrency test fee authorized by subsection (G)(1) of this section.

3.    The fees authorized in subsection (G)(1) or (G)(2) of this section shall not be refundable, shall not be waived, and shall not be credited against any other fee.

H.    Appeals. Determinations and decisions by the Director that are appealed by an applicant shall follow the procedures of Chapter 20.30 SMC for an Administrative Decision – Type B.

I.    Authority. The Director of Public Works, or his/her designee, shall be responsible for implementing and enforcing the concurrency requirements of this chapter. The Director of the Department of Public Works is authorized to adopt guidelines for the administration of concurrency, which may include the adoption of procedural rules to clarify or implement the provisions of this section.

20.60.150 Adequate access.

All lots shall have access to a public right-of-way by direct access to a right-of-way; an easement recorded with the county that meets the standards of this section; or an access tract that meets the standards of this section.

A.    Vehicular Access. All new development shall be served by adequate vehicular access as follows:

1.    The circulation system of development shall intersect with existing and anticipated streets abutting the site at safe and convenient locations;

2.    The circulation system of development shall provide direct connections to adjacent developments where appropriate; and

3.    Every lot upon which one or more buildings is proposed to be erected or traffic generating use is proposed to be established shall establish safe access as follows:

a.    Direct access from the street right-of-way, fire lane or a parking space to any part of the property as needed to provide public services (e.g., fire protection, emergency medical service, mail delivery or trash collection); and

b.    Direct access from the street right-of-way, driveway, alley or other means of ingress/egress approved by the City to all required off-street parking spaces on the premises.

B.    Pedestrian Access. All new development shall establish safe pedestrian access as follows:

1.    Pedestrian facilities connecting the street right-of-way to building entrances for transit patrons and other pedestrians;

2.    Pedestrian facilities connecting commercial developments, where appropriate; and

A.    The private street is located within a tract or easement; and

B.    A covenant, tract, or easement which provides for maintenance and repair of the private street by property owners has been approved by the City and recorded with King County; and

C.    The covenant or easement includes a condition that the private street will remain open at all times for emergency and public service vehicles; and

D.    The private street would not hinder public street circulation; and

E.    The proposed private street would be adequate for transportation and fire access needs; and

F.    At least one of the following conditions exists:

1.    The street would ultimately serve four or fewer single-family lots; or

2.    The private street would ultimately serve more than four lots, and the Director determines that no other access is available; or

3.    The private street would serve developments where no circulation continuity is necessary. (Ord. 591 § 2 (Exh. B), 2010).


20.70.250 Street naming and numbering.

The purpose of this section is to establish standards for designating street names and numbers, and for addressing the principal entrances of all buildings or other developments.

A.    All streets shall be named or numbered in the following manner:

1.    Public or private street names and/or numbers shall be consistent with the established grid system as determined by the Department. Named streets can only be assigned when the numbered grid is determined infeasible by the Department. The Department may change the existing public or private street name if it is determined to be inconsistent with the surrounding street naming system.

2.    All streets shall carry a geographic suffix or prefix. Streets designated as “Avenues” shall carry a geographic suffix and be in a north-south direction, and streets designated as “Streets” shall carry a geographic prefix and be in an east-west direction. Diagonal streets are treated as being either north-south or east-west streets. Names such as lane, place, way, court, and drive may be used on streets running either direction.

3.    Only entire street lengths or distinct major portions of street shall be separately designated.

4.    In determining the designation, the Department shall consider consistency with the provisions of this section and emergency services responsiveness including Emergency-911 services.

B.    Building addresses shall be assigned as follows:

1.    New Buildings. The assignment of addresses for new buildings shall occur in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit.

2.    New Lots. The assignment of addresses for new lots created by subdividing shall occur during project review and be included in the recording documents.

3.    Previously Unassigned Lots. Lots with no address of record shall be assigned an address and the property owner shall be notified of the address.

4.       The assignment of addresses shall be based on the following criteria:

a.    Even numbers shall be used on the northerly side of streets named as east-west and on the easterly side of streets named as north-south. 

b.    Odd numbers shall be used on the southerly side of streets named as east-west and on the westerly side of streets named as north-south. Addresses shall be assigned whole numbers only.

c.    In determining the address assignment, the Department shall consider the consistency with the provisions of this section, consistency with the addressing needs of the area, and emergency services.

C.    All buildings must display addresses as follows:

1.    The owner, occupant, or renter of any addressed building or other structure shall maintain the address numbers in a conspicuous place over or near the principal entrance or entrances. If said entrance(s) cannot be easily seen from the nearest adjoining street, the address numbers shall be placed in such other conspicuous place on said building or structure as is necessary for visually locating such address numbers from the nearest adjoining street.

2.    If the addressed building or structure cannot be easily seen or is greater than 50 feet from the nearest adjoining street, the address numbers shall be placed on a portion of the site that is clearly visible and no greater than 20 feet from the street.

3.    The address number figures shall comply with currently adopted building and fire codes. (Ord. 631 § 1 (Exh. 1), 2012; Ord. 591 § 2 (Exh. B), 2010).

B.    Standard frontage improvements consist of right-of-way dedication, curb, gutter, sidewalk, amenity zone and landscaping, drainage improvements and pavement overlays up to one-half of each right-of-way abutting a property as defined in the Master Street Plan. Additional improvements may be required to ensure safe movement of traffic, including pedestrians, bicycles, transit, and nonmotorized vehicles. The improvements can include transit bus shelters, bus pullouts, utility undergrounding, street lighting, signage and channelization.

C.    Frontage improvements are required:

1.    When building construction valuation for a permit exceeds 50 percent of the current County assessed or an appraised valuation of all existing structure(s) on the parcel (except for detached single-family homes). This shall include all structures on other parcels if the building under permit review extends into other parcels;

2.    When aggregate building construction valuations for issued permits, within any five-year period after March 30, 2013, exceed 50 percent of the County assessed or an appraised value of the existing structure(s) at the time of the first issued permit;

3.    For subdivisions;

4.    For development consisting of more than one dwelling unit on a single parcel (accessory dwelling units are exempt); or

In such cases, a contribution may be made and calculated based on the improvements that would be required of the development. Contributed funds shall be directed to the City’s capital project fund and shall be used for the capital project and offset future assessments on the property resulting from an LID. An LID “no-protest” commitment shall also be recorded. Adequate interim levels of improvements for public safety shall be required.

E.    Waivers may be approved by the Director of Public Works to not require frontage improvements under the following circumstances if the Director determines:

1.    The installation of the improvements will cause a safety hazard; or

2.    Construction of improvements will adversely impact critical areas that cannot be mitigated; or

3.    The current level of improvements in the rights-of-way of a local street adjacent to the R-4 or R-6 zone will not be changed because there is limited opportunity for additional improvements through development or redevelopment or a City project along the rights-of-way within the foreseeable future.

    The applicant shall utilize the deviation from the engineering standards process specified in SMC 20.30.290. The applicant shall address how the waiver satisfies the criteria for a deviation as well as the applicable conditions of this subsection. Supporting documentation and application fees shall be submitted with the waiver request.

F.    All improvements required under this chapter shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the Engineering Development Manual. Deviation from the Engineering Development Manual may be considered through a deviation process as set forth in SMC 20.30.290.

Subchapter 1.

Critical Areas – General Provisions


20.80.010 Purpose.

A.    The purpose of this chapter is to establish supplemental standards for the protection of critical areas, as defined in SMC 20.20.014, in compliance with the provisions of the Washington Growth Management Act of 1990 (Chapter 36.70A RCW) and consistent with the goals and policies of the Shoreline Comprehensive Plan in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 20.30 SMC. The standards of this chapter, as incorporated into the Shoreline Master Program, in Chapter 20.240 SMC, shall apply within the shoreline jurisdiction, where critical areas are present. If there are any conflicts or unclear distinctions between the Master Program and the City’s critical areas regulations, the most restrictive requirements apply as determined by the City.

B.    By identifying and regulating development and alterations to critical areas and their buffers, it is the intent of this chapter to:

1.    Protect the public from injury, loss of life, property damage or financial losses due to flooding, erosion, landslide, seismic events, or soils subsidence;

2.    Protect unique, fragile and valuable elements of the environment;

3.    Reduce cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands, streams, and other aquatic resources, fish and wildlife habitat, landslide hazards, and other geologically unstable features and protect the functions and values of critical areas from overall net loss;

4.    Ensure the long-term protection of ground and surface water quality;

5.    Alert members of the public, including appraisers, assessors, owners, potential buyers, or lessees, to the development limitations of critical areas and their required buffers;

6.    Serve as a basis for exercise of the City’s substantive authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and the City’s Environmental Procedures (Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 8); and comply with the requirements of the Growth Management Act (Chapter 36.70A RCW) and its implementing rules;

7.    Establish standards and procedures that are intended to protect critical areas while accommodating the rights of property owners to use their property in a reasonable manner; and

8.    Provide for the management of critical areas to maintain their functions and values and to restore degraded ecosystems.

C.    This chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this chapter to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of the property or to prevent the provision of public facilities and services necessary to support existing development and planned for by the community without decreasing current service levels below minimum standards. (Ord. 856 § 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 641 § 5 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 324 § 1, 2003; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 1(A), 2000).


20.80.015 Applicability.

A.    Unless explicitly exempted, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all land uses, development activity, and all structures and facilities within the City of Shoreline, whether or not a permit or authorization is required, that are within the maximum buffer distance for each critical area type, even if the critical area is on adjacent property. All persons within the City shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.

B.    The City shall not approve any permit or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation or to construct or alter any structure or improvement without first assuring compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

C.    Approval of a permit or development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

D.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any forest practices over which the City has jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 76.09 RCW and WAC Title 222. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.020 Relationship to other regulations.

A.    These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay in addition to zoning, land use, and other regulations established by the City of Shoreline. In the event of any conflict between these regulations and any other regulations of the City, the regulations which provide greater protection to the critical areas shall apply.

B.    Areas characterized by particular critical areas may also be subject to other regulations established by this chapter due to the overlap or multiple functions of some critical areas. In the event of any conflict between regulations for particular critical areas in this chapter, the regulations which provide greater protection to critical areas shall apply.

C.    These critical areas regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), as necessary and locally adopted. Any conditions required pursuant to this chapter shall be included in the SEPA review and threshold determination.

D.    Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with other Federal, State, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, shoreline substantial development permits, Hydraulic Permit Act (HPA) permits, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits, National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this chapter. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.025 Critical areas maps.

A.    The approximate location and extent of identified critical areas within the City’s planning area are shown on the critical areas maps adopted as part of this chapter, including but not limited to the maps identified in SMC 20.80.222, 20.80.272 and 20.80.322. These maps shall be used for informational purposes as a general guide only for the assistance of property owners and other interested parties. Boundaries and locations indicated on the maps are generalized. Critical areas and their buffers may occur within the City, which have not previously been mapped. A site inspection by staff or an applicant’s critical area worksheet may also indicate the presence of a critical area.

B.    Based on an indicated critical area in subsection A of this section, the actual presence or absence, delineation and classification of critical areas shall be identified in the field by a qualified professional, and confirmed by the City, according to the procedures, definitions and criteria established by SMC 20.80.080(D)(1) and (2). In the event of any conflict between the critical area location or designation shown on the City’s maps and the criteria or standards of this chapter, the criteria and standards shall prevail.

C.    The critical areas maps shall be periodically updated by the City and shall reflect any permit activity, results of special studies and reports reviewed and approved by the City, amendments to the Comprehensive Plan Natural Environment Element, and Department-identified errors and corrections. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 324 § 1, 2003; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 1(D), 2000. Formerly 20.80.020.).


20.80.030 Exemptions.

Notwithstanding the exemptions provided by this section, any otherwise exempt activities occurring in or near a critical area or critical area buffer should meet the purpose and intent of SMC 20.80.010 and should consider on-site alternatives that avoid or minimize impacts. To be exempt from this chapter does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense. The following activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter, but are not exempt from applicable permits:

A.    Emergencies. Alterations in response to emergencies which threaten the public health, safety and welfare or which pose an imminent risk of damage to private property as long as any alteration undertaken pursuant to this subsection is reported to the City no later than 30 days after the alteration. Only the minimum intervention necessary to reduce the risk to public health, safety, or welfare and/or the imminent risk of damage to private property shall be authorized by this exemption. The City shall confirm that an emergency exists and determine what, if any, additional applications and/or measures shall be required of the property owner to protect the critical area consistent with the provisions of this chapter, and to repair any damage to a preexisting resource. If the Director determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then enforcement provisions of SMC 20.80.130, Unauthorized critical area alterations, shall apply.

    After the emergency, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully fund and conduct necessary restoration and other mitigation for any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the emergency action in accordance with an approved critical area report and restoration/mitigation plan. The person or agency undertaking the action shall apply for review; and the alteration, critical area report, and mitigation plan shall be reviewed by the City in accordance with the review procedures contained herein. Mitigation activities must be initiated within one year of the date of the emergency;

Both the permit exemption request form and tree evaluation form shall be provided by the Director;

2.    The permit exemption request form shall include a grant of permission for the Director and/or qualified professionals under contract with or employed by the City to enter the subject property to evaluate the circumstances. Attached to the permit exemption request form shall be a risk assessment form that documents the hazard and which must be signed by a certified arborist or professional forester;

3.    No permit exemption request shall be approved until the Director reviews the submitted forms and conducts a site visit. The Director may require third party review of the request be performed by a qualified professional under contract with or employed by the City at the applicant’s expense, and may require that the subject tree(s) and vegetation be cordoned off with yellow warning tape during the review of the request for exemption;

4.    Approval to cut or clear trees may only be given upon recommendation of the qualified professional arborist that the condition constitutes an actual threat to life or property in homes, private yards, buildings, public or private streets and driveways, sidewalks, improved utility corridors, or access for emergency vehicles, and any trail, as proposed by the property owner and approved by the Director for purposes of this section;

5.    The Director shall authorize only such alteration to existing trees and vegetation as may be necessary to eliminate the hazard and shall condition authorization on means and methods of removal necessary to minimize environmental impacts, including replacement of any significant trees. The arborist shall include an assessment of whether a portion of the tree suitable for a snag for wildlife habitat may safely be retained. All work shall be done utilizing handheld implements only, unless the property owner requests and the Director approves otherwise in writing. The Director may require that all or a portion of cut materials be left on site;

6.    The removed trees shall be replaced within one year consistent with the provisions of SMC 20.50.360. Where nonsignificant trees are approved for removal as hazardous, replacement shall be one tree for each tree removed. Replacement tree(s) shall be planted at a different, nearby location on the same property if it can be determined that the planting in the same location would create a new hazard or potentially damage the critical area; and

7.    If a tree to be removed provides priority habitat, such as an eagle perch or occupied nest, a qualified professional shall be consulted, at the applicant’s expense, to determine timing and methods of removal that will minimize and mitigate impacts;

H.    Site Investigation. Site investigative work and studies necessary for preparing land use applications, including soils tests, water quality studies, wildlife studies and similar tests and investigations; provided, that any disturbance of the critical area shall be the minimum necessary to carry out the work or studies;

20.80.040 Allowed activities.

A.    Critical Area Report. Activities allowed under this section shall have been reviewed and permitted or approved by the City and any other agency with jurisdiction, but do not require submittal of a separate critical area report, unless such submittal was required previously for the underlying permit. The Director may apply conditions to the underlying permit or approval to ensure that the allowed activity is consistent with the provisions of this chapter to protect critical areas.

B.    Best Management Practices. All allowed activities shall be conducted using the best management practices that result in the least amount of impact to the critical areas. Best management practices shall be used for tree and vegetation protection, construction management, erosion and sedimentation control, water quality protection, and regulation of chemical applications. The City shall require the use of best management practices to ensure that the activity does not result in degradation to the critical area. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense.

C.    Allowed Activities. The following activities are allowed:

1.    Modifications to Existing Structures within Critical Areas. Structural modification of, addition to, maintenance, repair, or replacement of legally nonconforming structures consistent with SMC 20.30.280, which do not meet the building setback or buffer requirements for wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, or geologic hazard areas if the modification, addition, replacement or related activity does not increase the existing building footprint of the structure or area of hardscape lying within the critical area or buffer. Within landslide hazard areas additions that add height to a nonconforming structure may only be allowed with review of a critical area report demonstrating that no increased risk of the hazard will occur. If such modification, alteration, repair, or replacement requires encroachment into a critical area or a critical area buffer to perform the work, then encroachment may be allowed subject to restoration of the area of encroachment to a same or better condition.

2.    Demolition. Demolition of structures located within critical areas or their buffers, excluding demolition of structures necessary to support or stabilize landslide hazard areas, and subject to approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the adopted stormwater manual and clearing limits that will adequately protect the critical area.

3.    Permit Requests Subsequent to Previous Critical Area Review. A permit or approval sought as part of a development proposal for which multiple permits are required is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, except for the notice to title provisions, as applicable if:

a.    The City of Shoreline has previously reviewed all critical areas on the site; and

b.    There is no material change in the development proposal since the prior review; and

c.    There is no new information available which may alter previous critical area review of the site or a particular critical area; and

d.    The permit or approval under which the prior review was conducted has not expired or, if no expiration date, no more than five years have lapsed since the issuance of that permit or approval; and

e.    The prior permit or approval, including any conditions, has been complied with. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 324 § 1, 2003; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 1(H), 2000. Formerly 20.80.080.).


20.80.045 Critical areas preapplication meeting.

A.    A preapplication meeting, pursuant to SMC 20.30.080, is required prior to submitting an application for development or use of land or prior to starting a development activity or use of the land that may be regulated by the provisions of this chapter unless specifically exempted in SMC 20.80.030.

B.    A determination may be provided through the preapplication meeting regarding whether critical area reports are required, and if so what level of detail and what elements may be necessary for the proposed project. An applicant may submit a critical area delineation and classification study prior to the City determining that a full critical area report is required. 

This determination does not preclude the Director from requiring additional critical area report information during the review of the project. After a site visit and review of available information for the preapplication meeting, the Director may determine:

1.    No Critical Areas Present. If the Director’s analysis indicates that the project area is not within or adjacent to a critical area or buffer and that the proposed activity is unlikely to degrade the functions or values of a critical area, then the Director shall determine that the critical area review is complete and note in the preapplication meeting summary letter the reasons that no further review is required.

2.    Critical Areas Present, But No Impact. If the Director determines that there are critical areas within or adjacent to the project area, but that the best available science shows that the proposed activity is unlikely to degrade the functions or values of the critical area, the Director may waive the requirement for a critical area report. A waiver may be granted if there is substantial evidence that all of the following requirements will be met:

a.    There will be no alteration of the critical area or buffer;

b.    The development proposal will not impact the critical area in a manner contrary to the purpose, intent, and requirements of this chapter; and

c.    The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

    A summary of this analysis and the findings shall be included in the preapplication meeting summary letter and any staff report or decision on the underlying permit.

3.    Critical Areas May Be Affected by Proposal. If the Director determines that a critical area or areas may be affected by the proposal, then the Director shall notify the applicant that a critical area report(s) must be submitted prior to further review of the project, and indicate each of the critical area types that should be addressed in the report. Additionally, the Director may indicate the sections or report types that must be included in the critical report(s) consistent with SMC 20.80.080. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.050 Alteration of critical areas.

In general, critical areas and their buffers shall be maintained in their existing state including undisturbed, native vegetation to maintain the functions, values, resources, and public health and safety for which they are protected or allowed as the current, developed legally established condition such as graded areas, structures, pavement, gardens and lawns. Alteration of critical areas, including their established buffers, may only be permitted subject to the criteria and standards in this chapter, and compliance with any Federal and/or State permits required. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, if alteration of the critical area is unavoidable, all adverse impacts to or from critical areas and buffers resulting from a development proposal or alteration shall be mitigated using the best available science in accordance with an approved critical areas report, so as to result in no overall net loss of critical area functions and values and no increased risk of hazards. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).




20.80.053 Mitigation requirements.

Mitigation shall be sufficient to maintain or compensate for the impacted functions and values of the critical area and to prevent risk from a hazard posed by a critical area. Mitigation shall not be implemented until after the Director has provided approval of a critical areas report that includes a mitigation plan.

A.    Mitigation Sequencing. This section applies to mitigation required with all critical areas reviews, approvals, and enforcement pursuant to this chapter. This section is supplemented with specific measures under subchapters for particular critical areas. Mitigation for specific development proposals may include a combination of the measures below and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this section. Before impacting any critical areas, an applicant shall demonstrate that the following actions have been taken in the following sequential order of preference:

1.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of actions;

2.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocation, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts;

3.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment or by restoring or stabilizing the hazard area through natural, engineering, or other methods;

4.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time through preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

5.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and/or

6.    Monitoring, measuring and reporting the impact to the Director and taking appropriate corrective measures.

B.    Applicants must first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before the use of actions to mitigate potential impacts will be allowed. No activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or values of critical areas.

C.    Type, Location, and Timing of Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning or greater reduction of hazard risk would result from an alternative approach or as otherwise allowed in this chapter, mitigation for adverse impacts shall be based on best available science and shall be in-kind, on-site, and prior to the activities that will disturb the critical area. Mitigation measures that cannot be implemented prior to the critical area impacts shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora.

1.    The Director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g., project delay lapses past a fisheries window, or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, or general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the City. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.056 Voluntary critical area restoration projects.

A.    When a critical area restoration project is proposed that is not required as mitigation for a development proposal, the City may grant relief from standard critical area buffer requirements if the restoration project involves:

1.    The daylighting of a stream; or

2.    Creation or expansion of a wetland that would increase the area of the wetland and/or wetland buffer.

B.    At the time a restoration project is proposed, a buffer shall be established that will apply to the restoration project boundary. Restoration project buffers shall be established according to the following requirements:

1.    A buffer may be applied to the restored portion of the stream or wetland that is not less than 75 percent of the standard buffer associated with the type of stream or category of wetland; or

2.    The project proponent may request a reduced buffer of between 50 percent and 75 percent of the standard buffer associated with the type of stream or category of wetland. The following criteria will be used by the City in reviewing the request for a reduced buffer:

a.    The Director determines that applying a 50 percent to 75 percent buffer would significantly limit the use of the property for existing or permitted uses, thus making the restoration project infeasible;

b.    The proposed buffer relief is the minimum necessary to achieve the restoration project;

c.    There will be a net environmental benefit from the restoration project with the reduced buffer;

d.    Granting the proposed relief is consistent with the objectives of the critical area restoration project and consistent with purposes of the City’s critical area regulations. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.060 Best available science.

A.    Protect Functions and Values of Critical Areas with Special Consideration to Anadromous Fish. Critical area reports and decisions to alter critical areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and values of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish, such as salmon and bull trout, and their habitat, where applicable.

B.    Best Available Science to Be Consistent with Criteria. The best available science is that scientific information, obtained through a valid scientific process, that is applicable to the critical area prepared by local, State, or Federal natural resource agencies, a qualified scientific professional, or team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-195-900 through WAC 365-195-925 and RCW 36.70A.172.

C.    Characteristics of a Valid Scientific Process. In the context of critical areas protection, a valid scientific process is one that produces reliable information useful in understanding the consequences of a local government’s regulatory decisions, and in developing critical areas policies and development regulations that will be effective in protecting the functions and values of critical areas. To determine whether information received during the permit review process is reliable scientific information, the Director shall determine whether the source of the information displays the characteristics of a valid scientific process. Such characteristics are as follows:

1.    Peer Review. The information has been critically reviewed by other persons who are qualified scientific experts in that scientific discipline. The proponents of the information have addressed the criticism of the peer reviewers. Publication in a referenced scientific journal usually indicates that the information has been appropriately peer-reviewed;

2.    Methods. The methods used to obtain the information are clearly stated and reproducible. The methods are standardized in the pertinent scientific discipline or, if not, the methods have been appropriately peer-reviewed to ensure their reliability and validity;

3.    Logical Conclusions and Reasonable Inferences. The conclusions presented are based on reasonable assumptions supported by other studies and consistent with the general theory underlying the assumptions. The conclusions are logically and reasonably derived from the assumptions and supported by the data presented. Any gaps in information and inconsistencies with other pertinent scientific information are adequately explained;

4.    Quantitative Analysis. The data have been analyzed using appropriate statistical or quantitative methods;

5.    Context. The information is placed in proper context. The assumptions, analytical techniques, data, and conclusions are appropriately framed with respect to the prevailing body of pertinent scientific knowledge; and

6.    References. The assumptions, analytical techniques, and conclusions are well-referenced with citations to relevant, credible literature, and other pertinent existing information.

D.    Nonscientific Information. Nonscientific information, such as anecdotal observations, nonexpert opinion, and hearsay, may supplement scientific information, but it is not an adequate substitute for valid and available scientific information.

E.    Absence of Valid Scientific Information. Where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area, leading to uncertainty about the risk to critical area function, for permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area, the Director shall:

1.    Take a “precautionary or a no-risk approach,” that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved; and

2.    Require application of an effective adaptive management program that relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and nonregulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty. An adaptive management program shall:

a.    Address funding for the research component of the adaptive management program;

b.    Change course based on the results and interpretation of new information that resolves uncertainties; and

c.    Commit to the appropriate time frame and scale necessary to reliably evaluate regulatory and nonregulatory actions affecting protection of critical areas and anadromous fisheries. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.070 Classification and rating of critical areas.

To promote consistent application of the standards and requirements of this chapter, critical areas within the City of Shoreline shall be rated or classified according to their characteristics, function and value, and/or their sensitivity to disturbance. Classification of critical areas shall be determined by the City using the following tools:

A.    Application of the criteria contained in these regulations;

B.    Consideration of the critical area reports submitted by qualified professionals in connection with applications subject to these regulations; and

C.    Review of maps adopted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.080 Critical area report – Requirements.

A.    Report Required. If uses, activities, or developments are proposed within, adjacent to, or are likely to impact critical areas or their buffers, an applicant shall provide site-specific information and analysis in the form of critical area report(s) as required in this chapter. Critical area reports are required in order to identify the presence, extent, and classification/rating of potential critical areas, as well as to analyze, assess, and mitigate the potential adverse impact to or risk from critical areas for a development project. Critical area reports shall use standards for best available science in SMC 20.80.060. Critical area reports for two or more types of critical areas must meet the report requirements for each type of critical area. The expense of preparing the critical area report(s) shall be borne by the applicant. This provision is not intended to expand or limit an applicant’s other obligations under WAC 197-11-100.

B.    Preparation by Qualified Professional. Critical area report(s) shall be prepared by qualified professional(s) as defined in SMC 20.20.042, with the required training and experience specific to the type(s) of critical area(s) present consistent with the requirements of SMC 20.80.240, 20.80.290, and 20.80.340. Proof of licensing, credentials, and resume of the qualified professional(s) preparing the report must be submitted for review by the City to determine if the minimum qualifications are met.

C.    Third Party Review of Critical Area Reports. Review of required critical area reports by a qualified professional under contract with or employed by the City will be required by the Director at the applicant’s expense in any of the following circumstances:

1.    The project requires a critical area reasonable use permit (CARUP), critical area special use permit (CASUP), or shoreline variance application; or

2.    Third party review is specifically required by the provisions of this chapter for the critical area(s) or critical area buffer(s) potentially being impacted; or

3.    When the Director determines such services are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the standards and guidelines of this chapter.

D.    Critical Area Report Types or Sections. Critical area reports may be met in stages through multiple reports or combined in one report. A critical area report shall include one or more of the following sections or report types unless exempted by the Director based on the extent of the potential critical area impacts. The scope and location of the proposed project will determine which report(s) alone or combined are sufficient to meet the critical area report requirements for the impacted critical area type(s). The typical sequence of required sections or reports that will fulfill the requirements of this section include:

1.    Reconnaissance. The existence, general location, and type of critical areas in the vicinity of a project site (off site within 300 feet for wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and off site within 200 feet for geologic hazards, shorelines, floodplains, and aquifer recharge areas) of a project site (if allowed by the adjoining property owners). Determination of whether the project will adversely impact or be at risk from the potential critical areas based on maximum potential buffers and possible application of SMC 20.80.220(A)(3), 20.80.280(D)(7) or 20.80.330(G)(10) should be addressed;

2.    Delineation.

12.    Plans for mitigation required to offset any critical areas impacts, in accordance with SMC 20.80.082, Mitigation plan requirements, and the corresponding mitigation performance standards sections of this chapter, including a discussion of the applicable development standards and cost estimates for determination of financial guarantee requirements.

F.    Existing Reports. Unless otherwise provided, a critical areas report may incorporate, be supplemented by, or composed of any reports or studies required by other laws and regulations or previously prepared for and applicable to the development proposal site, as approved by the Director. At the discretion of the Director, reports previously compiled or submitted as part of a proposal for development may be used as a critical areas report to the extent that the requirements of this section and the report requirements for each specific critical area type are met. Critical areas reports shall be considered valid for five years; after such date the City shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary. Supplemental critical area report(s) may be required to provide information and analysis to address changes to the project scope and potential impacts or to changes to applicable regulations that have been made subsequent to existing, valid critical area reports.

G.    Modifications to Report Requirements.

1.    Limitations to Study Area. The Director may limit the required geographic area of the critical areas report as appropriate if:

a.    The applicant, with assistance from the City of Shoreline, cannot obtain permission to access properties adjacent to the project area; or

b.    The proposed activity will affect only a limited part of the subject site.

2.    Modifications to Required Contents. The applicant may consult with the Director prior to or during preparation of the critical areas report to obtain approval of modifications to the required contents of the report where, in the judgment of a qualified professional, more or less information is required to adequately address the potential critical area impacts and required mitigation. In some cases, such as when it is determined that no geologic hazard area is present, a full report may not be necessary to determine compliance with the critical area regulations, this chapter, and in those cases a letter or reconnaissance only report may be required.

3.    Additional Information Requirements. The Director may require additional information to be included in the critical areas report when determined to be necessary to the review of the proposed activity in accordance with this chapter. Additional information that may be required includes, but is not limited to:

a.    Historical data, including original and subsequent mapping, aerial photographs, data compilations and summaries, and available reports and records relating to the site or past operations at the site;

b.    Grading and drainage plans; and

c.    Information specific to the type, location, and nature of the critical area. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.082 Mitigation plan requirements.

When mitigation is required, the applicant shall submit for approval by the City a mitigation plan as part of the critical area report. Mitigation plans must meet the minimum requirements of SMC 20.80.080 and the applicable mitigation performance standards and requirements for the impacted type(s) of critical area(s) and buffer(s), including but not limited to SMC 20.80.250, 20.80.300, and 20.80.350. When the mitigation plan is submitted separately from other types or sections of the required critical area report(s), the mitigation plan must meet the minimum content requirements of SMC 20.80.080(E) by inclusion or reference to other existing report(s). The mitigation plan shall include:

A.    Environmental Goals and Objectives. The mitigation plan shall include a written report identifying environmental goals and objectives of the mitigation proposed and including:

1.    A description of the anticipated impacts to the critical areas, the mitigating actions proposed, and the purposes of the compensation measures, including the site selection criteria; identification of compensation goals; identification of resource functions; and dates for beginning and completion of site compensation construction activities. The goals and objectives shall be related to the functions and values of the impacted critical area; and

2.    A review of the best available science supporting the proposed mitigation and a description of the report author’s experience to date in restoring or creating the type of critical area proposed.

B.    Performance Standards. The mitigation plan shall include measurable specific criteria for evaluating whether or not the goals and objectives of the mitigation project have been successfully attained at the end of the required monitoring period and whether or not the requirements of this chapter have been met.

C.    Detailed Construction Plans. The mitigation plan shall include written specifications and descriptions of the mitigation proposed, such as:

1.    The proposed construction sequence, timing, and duration;

2.    Site plans showing grading and excavation details with minimum two-foot contour intervals;

    These written specifications shall be accompanied by detailed site diagrams, scaled cross-sectional drawings, topographic maps showing slope percentage and final grade elevations, and any other drawings appropriate to show construction techniques or anticipated final outcome.

D.    Monitoring Program and Contingency Plan.

1.    A monitoring program shall be included in the mitigation plan and implemented by the applicant to determine the success of the mitigation project and any necessary corrective actions. This program shall determine if the original goals and objectives of the mitigation plan are being met.

2.    A contingency plan shall be established for indemnity in the event that the mitigation project is inadequate or fails. Contingency plans include identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates project performance standards are not being met. Corrective measures will be required by the City when the qualified professional indicates, in a monitoring report, that the contingency actions are needed to ensure project success by the end of the monitoring period. A performance and maintenance bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, is required to ensure the applicant’s compliance with the terms of the mitigation agreement consistent with SMC 20.80.120, Financial guarantee requirements.

3.    Monitoring programs prepared to comply with this section shall include the following requirements:

a.    Best available scientific procedures shall be used to establish the success or failure of the project. A protocol outlining the schedule for site monitoring (for example, monitoring shall occur in years zero (as-built), one, three, and five after site construction), and how the monitoring data will be evaluated to determine if the performance standards are being met.

b.    For vegetation determinations, permanent sampling points shall be established.

c.    Vegetative success shall, at a minimum, equal 80 percent survival of planted trees and shrubs and 80 percent cover of desirable understory or emergent plant species at the end of the required monitoring period. Alternative standards for vegetative success, including (but not limited to) minimum survival standards following the first growing season, may be required after consideration of recommendations provided in a critical area report or as otherwise required by the provisions of this chapter.

d.    A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the mitigation project. Monitoring reports on the current status of the mitigation project shall be submitted, consistent with subsection E of this section, to the City on the schedule identified in the monitoring plan, but not less than every other year. The reports are to be prepared by a qualified professional and reviewed by the City, or a qualified professional retained by the City, and should include monitoring information on wildlife, vegetation, water quality, water flow, stormwater storage and conveyance, and existing or potential degradation, as applicable.

e.    Monitoring programs shall be established for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for less than a minimum of five years without approval from the Director. Monitoring programs for projects located within the shoreline jurisdiction must also comply with the standards in SMC 20.230.020 and may require a longer monitoring period.

f.    If necessary, failures in the mitigation project shall be corrected.

g.    Dead or undesirable vegetation shall be replaced with appropriate plantings.

c.    Determination whether performance standards are being met; and

d.    Maintenance and/or contingency action recommendations to ensure success of the project at the end of the monitoring period.

3.    The applicant shall be responsible for the cost (at the current hourly rate) of review of monitoring reports and site inspections during the monitoring period, which are completed by the City or a qualified professional under contract with or employed by the City.

F.    Cost Estimates. The mitigation plan shall include cost estimates that will be used by the City to calculate the amounts of financial guarantees, if necessary, to ensure that the mitigation plan is fully implemented. Financial guarantees ensuring fulfillment of the compensation project, monitoring program, and any contingency measures shall be posted in accordance with SMC 20.80.120, Financial guarantee requirements.

G.    Approved Mitigation Projects – Signature. On completion of construction, an as-built report for any approved mitigation project shall be prepared and signed off by the applicant’s qualified professional and approved by the City. Signature of the qualified professional on the required as-built report and approval by the City will indicate that the construction has been completed as planned. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.085 Pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers on City-owned property.

Pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers which have been identified by State or Federal agencies as harmful to humans, wildlife, or fish shall not be used in a City-owned riparian corridor, shoreline habitat or its buffer, wetland or its buffer, except as allowed by the Director for the following circumstances:

A.    When the Director determines that an emergency situation exists where there is a serious threat to public safety, health, or the environment, and that an otherwise prohibited application must be used as a last resort.

B.    Compost or fertilizer may be used for native plant revegetation projects in any location.

C.    Limited pesticide and herbicide use may be applied pursuant to the King County Noxious Weed Control Board best management practices, specific to the species needing control, when that is determined to be the best method of control for the location. Federal, State, and local regulations of pesticides and water quality must be followed, including requirements for pesticide applicator licensing from the Washington State Department of Agriculture. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006).


20.80.090 Buffer areas.

The establishment of buffer areas shall be required for all development proposals and activities in or adjacent to critical areas. In all cases the standard buffer shall apply unless the Director determines that additional buffer width is necessary or reduced buffer is sufficient to protect the functions and values consistent with the provisions of this chapter and the recommendations of a qualified professional. The purpose of the buffer shall be to protect the integrity, function, value and resource of the subject critical area, and/or to protect life, property and resources from risks associated with development on unstable or critical lands and consists of an undisturbed area of native vegetation. Buffers shall be protected during construction by placement of a temporary barricade if determined necessary by the City, on-site notice for construction crews of the presence of the critical area, and implementation of appropriate erosion and sedimentation controls. Restrictive covenants or conservation easements may be required to preserve and protect buffer areas. (Ord. 789 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 324 § 1, 2003; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 2(C), 2000. Formerly 20.80.180.).


20.80.100 Notice to title.

A critical area notice to title is required, as a condition of permit issuance or project approval, when a permit or development application is submitted for development on any property containing a critical area or buffer. The purpose is to inform subsequent purchasers of real property of the existence of critical areas. This requirement can be met through recording of a notice to title prepared by the City, establishment of a critical area tract, or recording of native growth protection area easement consistent with the following provisions:

A.    Notice to Title. A notice to title is required when a permit is required for development on any property containing a critical area or buffer. The notice to title applicable to the property shall be approved by the Director and City Attorney for compliance with this provision and be filed by the property owner, at their expense, with the King County Recorder’s Office. The title holder will have the right to challenge this notice and to have it extinguished if the critical area designation no longer applies. However, the titleholder shall be responsible for completing a critical area report, subject to approval by the Director, before the notice on title can be extinguished. The notice shall state that critical areas or buffers have been identified on the property and that limitations on actions in or affecting the critical area or buffer may exist. The notice shall run with the land. A critical area tract or native growth protection area easement shall be required to meet the notice to title requirement as follows:

1.    Critical Area Tract. Subdivisions, short subdivisions, and binding site plans shall establish a separate critical areas tract as a permanent protective measure for wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and landslide hazard areas and their buffers. The plat or binding site plan for the project shall clearly depict the critical areas tract, and shall include all of the subject critical area, any required buffer, and any additional lands included voluntarily by the developer. Restrictions to development within the critical area tract shall be clearly noted on the plat or plan. Restrictions shall be consistent with this chapter for the entire critical area tract. Should the critical area tract include several types of critical areas, the developer may establish separate critical areas tracts; or

2.    Native Growth Protection Area. NGPA easements shall be required on a property where no subdivision, short subdivision, or binding site plan is proposed or required. Unless otherwise required in this chapter, native growth protection area (NGPA) easements shall be recorded on title for all affected parcels prior to approval of a development agreement, issuance of a master development plan permit, or issuance of a site development or building permit, when two or more dwelling units and/or nonresidential development are proposed on one parcel, to delineate and protect those contiguous wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation, and landslide hazard critical areas and their buffers. The easement to be recorded shall clearly depict the critical area and the limits of the NGPA easement and shall include all of the subject critical area(s) and any required buffer(s). Restrictions to development within the NGPA easement shall be clearly noted in the easement and shall include the following:

a.    That native vegetation will be preserved for the purpose of preventing harm to property and the environment, including, but not limited to, controlling surface water runoff and erosion, limiting chemical applications of hazardous substances (pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers), maintaining slope stability, buffering, and protecting plants, fish, and animal habitat; and

b.    The right of the City to enforce the terms of the restriction.

B.    Modifications and Waivers. Where the standards in this chapter allow for development within the identified critical areas, the Director may modify the language or dimensions of the required critical area tract or native growth protection area easement for consistency with the extent of the development to be permitted.

C.    Proof of Notice. The applicant shall submit proof that the notice has been recorded on title before the City approves any development permit, including master development plan permits, for the property or, in the case of subdivisions, short subdivisions, binding site plans, or development agreements, at or before recording. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.110 Permanent field marking.

A.    All critical areas tracts, easements, and dedications, or as recommended by a qualified professional, shall be clearly marked on the site using permanent markings, placed at least every 50 feet, which include the following text:

City of Shoreline Designated Critical Area. Activities, including clearing and grading, removal of vegetation, pruning, cutting of trees or shrubs, planting of nonnative species, and other alterations may be prohibited. Help protect and care for this area. Please contact the City of Shoreline with questions or concerns.

B.    It is the responsibility of the landowner to maintain in perpetuity and replace if necessary all permanent field markings. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.120 Financial guarantee requirements.

Bonds, and other financial guarantees, and associated performance agreements or maintenance/defect/monitoring agreements shall be required for projects with required mitigation or restoration of impacts to critical areas or critical area buffers consistent with the following:

A.    A performance agreement and bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, are required from the applicant when mitigation required pursuant to a development proposal is not completed prior to final permit approval, such as final plat approval or final building inspection. The amount of the performance bond(s) shall equal 125 percent of the cost of the mitigation project (after City mobilization is calculated).

B.    A performance agreement and bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, are required from the applicant when restoration is required for remediation of a critical area violation. The amount of the performance bond(s) shall equal 125 percent of the cost of the mitigation project (after City mobilization is calculated).

C.    A maintenance/defect/monitoring agreement and bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, are required to ensure the applicant’s compliance with the conditions of the approved mitigation plan pursuant to a development proposal or restoration plan for remediation of a violation. The amount of the maintenance bond(s) shall equal 25 percent of the cost of the mitigation project (after City mobilization is calculated) in addition to the cost for monitoring for a minimum of five years. The monitoring portion of the financial guarantee may be reduced in proportion to work successfully completed over the period of the bond. The bonding period shall coincide with the monitoring period. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.130 Unauthorized critical area alterations.

A.    When a critical area or its buffer has been altered in violation of this chapter, all ongoing development work shall stop and the critical area shall be restored. The City shall have the authority to issue a stop work order to cease all development, and order restoration measures at the owner’s or other responsible party’s expense to remediate the impacts of the violation of the provisions of this chapter.

B.    Requirement for Restoration Plan. All development shall remain stopped until a restoration plan is prepared by the responsible party and an approved permit is issued by the City. Such a plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional using the best available science and shall describe how the actions proposed meet the minimum requirements described in subsection C of this section.

Subchapter 2.

Geologic Hazard Areas


20.80.210 Geologic hazards – Designation and purpose.

A.    Geologic hazard areas are those lands that are susceptible to erosion, landsliding, seismic, or other geological events as identified by WAC 365-190-120. These areas may not be suited for development activities because they may pose a threat to public health and safety.

    Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as geologic hazard areas:

1.    Landslide hazard;

2.    Seismic hazard;

3.    Erosion hazard.

B.    The primary purpose of geologic hazard area regulations is to avoid and minimize potential impacts to life and property from geologic hazards, conserve soil resources, and minimize structural damage relating to seismic hazards. This purpose shall be accomplished through appropriate levels of study and analysis, application of sound engineering principles, and regulation or limitation of land uses, including maintenance of existing vegetation, regulation of clearing and grading activities, and control of stormwater. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 3(A), 2000).


20.80.220 Geologic hazards – Classification.

Geologic hazard areas shall be classified according to the criteria in this section as follows:

A.    Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are those areas potentially subject to landslide activity based on a combination of geologic, topographic and hydrogeologic factors as classified in subsection B of this section with slopes 15 percent or steeper within a vertical elevation change of at least 10 feet or all areas of prior landslide activity regardless of slope. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top, and measuring the inclination over 10 feet of vertical relief (see Figure 20.80.220(A)). The edges of the geologic hazard are identified where the characteristics of the slope cross-section change from one landslide hazard classification to another, or no longer meet any classification. Additionally:

1.    The toe of a slope is a distinct topographic break which separates slopes inclined at less than 15 percent from slopes above that are 15 percent or steeper when measured over 10 feet of vertical relief; and

2.    The top of a slope is a distinct topographic break which separates slopes inclined at less than 15 percent from slopes below that are 15 percent or steeper when measured over 10 feet of vertical relief.

B.    Landslide Hazard Area Classification. Landslide hazard areas are classified as follows:

1.    Moderate to High Risk.

a.    Areas with slopes between 15 percent and 40 percent and that are underlain by soils that consist largely of sand, gravel or glacial till that do not meet the criteria for very high risk areas in subsection (B)(2) of this section;

b.    Areas with slopes between 15 percent and 40 percent that are underlain by soils consisting largely of silt and clay and do not meet the criteria for very high risk areas in subsection (B)(2) of this section; or

c.    All slopes of 10 to 20 feet in height that are 40 percent slope or steeper and do not meet the criteria for very high risk in subsection (B)(2)(a) or (b) of this section.

2.    Very High Risk.

a.    Areas with slopes steeper than 15 percent with zones of emergent water (e.g., springs or ground water seepage);

b.    Areas of landslide activity (scarps, movement, or accumulated debris) regardless of slope; or

c.    All slopes that are 40 percent or steeper and more than 20 feet in height when slope is averaged over 10 vertical feet of relief.

C.    Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are lands that, due to a combination of soil and ground water conditions, are subject to risk of ground shaking, lateral spreading, subsidence or liquefaction of soils during earthquakes. These areas are typically underlain by soft or loose saturated soils (such as alluvium) or peat deposits and have a shallow ground water table. These areas are designated as having “high” and “moderate to high” risk of liquefaction as mapped on the Liquefaction Susceptibility and Site Class Maps of Western Washington State by County by the Washington State Department of Natural Areas.

D.    Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are lands or areas underlain by soils identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service) as having “severe” or “very severe” erosion hazards. This includes, but is not limited to, the following group of soils when they occur on slopes of 15 percent or greater: Alderwood-Kitsap (AkF), Alderwood gravelly sandy loam (AgD), Kitsap silt loam (KpD), Everett (EvD) and Indianola (InD). (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 3(B), 2000).


20.80.222 Geologic hazards – Mapping.

A.    The approximate location and extent of geologic hazard areas are shown on City of Shoreline geologic hazard data layers maintained in the City of Shoreline geographic information system (GIS). In addition, the following maps and resources providing information on the location and extent of geologic hazard areas are hereby adopted by reference as amended:

1.    Washington Department of Ecology coastal zone atlas (for marine bluffs);

2.    U.S. Geological Survey geologic maps, landslide hazard maps, and seismic hazard maps;

3.    Washington State Department of Natural Resources seismic hazard maps for Western Washington, including, but not limited to, the Liquefaction Susceptibility and Site Class Maps of Western Washington State by County;

4.    Washington State Department of Natural Resources slope stability maps; and

5.    Soils maps produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Resources Conservation Service.

B.    The critical areas maps and the resources cited above are to be used as a guide for the City of Shoreline Planning and Community Development Department, project applicants, and/or property owners and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. They are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.224 Geologic hazards – Development standards.

A.    Activities and uses shall be allowed in geologic hazard areas and their required buffers only as provided for in this chapter.

B.    Activities Allowed in All Geologic Hazard Areas and Buffers. The activities listed below are allowed in the identified geologic hazard areas types pursuant to SMC 20.80.040, Allowed activities. Exemptions are listed in SMC 20.80.030, but do not apply within the shoreline jurisdiction. These activities do not require submission of a critical area report.

1.    All allowed activities per SMC 20.80.040;

2.    Installation of fences as allowed without a building permit in Chapter 20.50 SMC, General Development Standards;

3.    Nonstructural interior remodel, maintenance, or repair of structures which do not meet the standards of this chapter, if the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or height of the structure and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed maintenance or repair; and

4.    Erosion Hazard Areas. If the project is located in an erosion hazard area and is not located in another type of critical area or critical area buffer and does not exceed any other threshold contained in SMC 20.50.320, then up to 1,500 square feet may be cleared on any lot in an erosion hazard area without a permit.

C.    Alteration. The City may approve, condition, or deny proposals in a geologic hazard area based upon the effective mitigation of risks posed to property, health and safety. The objective of mitigation measures shall be to render a site containing a geologic hazard as safe as one not containing such hazard. Conditions may include applicable stormwater management practices, limitations of proposed uses, modification of density, alteration of site layout, and other appropriate changes to the proposal.

Where potential impacts cannot be effectively mitigated to eliminate a significant risk to public health and safety and property or other critical area, the proposal shall be denied, except as granted by a critical area special use or critical area reasonable use permit per SMC 20.30.333 and 20.30.336, or subject to the provisions of the Shoreline Master Program, SMC Title 20, Division II, where the proposed development activity is located within the shoreline jurisdiction.

D.    Alteration of Moderate to High Risk Landslide Hazards. Development activities and uses that result in unavoidable alterations may be permitted in moderate to high risk landslide hazard areas or their buffers in accordance with an approved geologic hazard critical area report. The recommendations contained within the critical area report shall be incorporated into the proposed alteration of the landslide hazard area or its buffers.

    The critical area report shall certify that:

1.    The risk of damage from the proposal, both on site, and off site, are minimal subject to the conditions set forth in the report;

2.    The proposal will not increase the risk of occurrence of the potential landslide hazard; and

3.    Measures to eliminate or reduce risks have been incorporated into the report’s recommendations and project development plans.

E.    Alteration of Very High Risk Landslide Hazard Areas. Alterations of a very high risk landslide hazard area and/or buffer may only occur for activities for which a critical area report with a hazards analysis is submitted and certifies that:

1.    The development will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation on site or to adjacent properties beyond pre-development conditions;

2.    The development will not decrease slope stability on the site or on adjacent properties;

3.    Such alterations will meet other critical areas regulations; and

4.    The design criteria in subsection F of this section are met.

F.    Design Criteria for Alteration of Very High Risk Landslide Hazard Areas. Development within a very high risk landslide hazard area and/or buffer shall be designed to meet the following basic requirements unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative project design provides greater short- and long-term slope stability while meeting all other provisions of this chapter. The requirement for long-term slope stability shall exclude designs that require regular and periodic maintenance to maintain their level of function. The basic development design criteria are:

1.    The proposed development shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.5 for static conditions and 1.2 for dynamic conditions. Proposed alteration of natural slopes, that does not include structures, shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.3 for static conditions and 1.0 for seismic. Where the existing conditions are below these limits, the proposed development shall increase the factor of safety to these limits or will not be permitted. Analysis of dynamic conditions shall be based on the seismic event as established by the current version of the International Building Code;

2.    New structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologic hazard areas and other critical areas;

3.    New structures and improvements shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope, and foundations shall be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography;

4.    New structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation;

5.    The proposed development shall not result in greater risk of the hazard or a need for increased buffers on neighboring properties;

6.    Where the existing natural slope area cannot be retained undisturbed with native vegetation, the use of retaining walls that allow the maintenance of existing natural slope area is preferred over graded artificial slopes; and

7.    Development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage and preserve native vegetation and trees to the maximum extent practicable.

G.    Additional Requirements for Alteration of Very High Risk Hazard Landslide Areas.

1.    Prior to application, the applicant shall meet the requirements of and conduct a neighborhood meeting consistent with SMC 20.30.090. The notification area shall be limited to:

a.    All property owners whose properties adjoin the subject property; and

b.    Properties that include part of the subject property’s very high risk landslide hazard area and the standard 50-foot buffer, but not to exceed a maximum of 200 feet from the project clearing limits.

2.    Prior to permit issuance, the property owner shall sign and record on title, at the owner’s sole expense, a covenant in a form acceptable to the City, which:

a.    Acknowledges and accepts the risks of development in the landslide hazard area;

b.    Waives any rights to claims against the City;

c.    Indemnifies and holds harmless the City against claims, losses, and damages;

d.    Informs subsequent owners of the property of the risks and the covenant; and

e.    Advisability of obtaining added insurance.

3.    Prior to permit issuance, the piling and excavation contractors shall submit insurance bonding documentation that includes coverage for subsidence and underground property damage, listing the City as an additional insured. The Director may require adequate bonds and/or insurance to cover potential claims for property damage that may arise from or be related to the following:

a.    Excavation or fill within a landslide-prone area when the depth of the proposed excavation exceeds four feet and the bottom of the proposed excavation is below the 100 percent slope line (45 degrees from a horizontal line) from the property line; or

b.    In other circumstances where the Director determines that there is a potential for significant harm to any type of critical area or a critical area buffer during the construction process.

4.    If the Building Official has reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists because significant changes in geologic conditions at a project site or in the surrounding area may have occurred since a permit was issued, increasing the risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to nearby surface waters, the building official may, by letter or other reasonable means of notification, suspend the permit until the applicant has submitted a letter of certification. The letter of certification shall be based on such factors as the presence of known slides, indications of changed conditions at the site or the surrounding area, or other indications of unstable soils and meet the following requirements:

a.    The letter of certification shall be from the current project qualified professional geotechnical engineer of record stating that a qualified professional geotechnical engineer has inspected the site and area surrounding the proposed development within the 60 days preceding submittal of the letter; and that:

i.    In the project geotechnical engineer’s professional opinion no significant changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that render invalid or out-of-date the analysis and recommendations contained in the technical reports and other application materials previously submitted to the City as part of the application for the permit; or that

ii.    In the project geotechnical engineer’s professional opinion, changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that require revision to project criteria and that all technical reports and any necessary revised drawings that account for the changed conditions have been prepared and submitted.

5.    The letter of certification and any required revisions shall be reviewed and approved by the City’s third party qualified professional, at the applicant’s expense, before the Building Official may allow work to continue under the permit.

H.    Alteration of Seismic Hazard Areas. Development activities and uses in seismic hazard areas may be permitted, not subject to SMC 20.80.053(A)(1), based on review of a critical area report demonstrating that the project is consistent with SMC 20.80.053(A)(2) through (6). The report must certify that the risks of damage from the proposal, both on site and off site, are minimal subject to the conditions set forth in the report, that the proposal will not increase the risk of occurrence of the potential hazard, and that measures to eliminate or reduce risks have been incorporated into the report’s recommendations. The report must include the following:

1.    For one-story and two-story detached residential structures, a qualified professional shall conduct an evaluation of site response and liquefaction potential based on current mapping, site reconnaissance, research of nearby studies.

2.    For all other proposals, the qualified professional shall conduct an evaluation of site response and liquefaction potential including sufficient subsurface exploration to determine the site coefficient for use in the static lateral force procedure described in the International Building Code.

I.    Alteration of Erosion Hazard Areas. Development activities and uses in erosion hazard areas may be permitted, not subject to SMC 20.80.053(A)(1), based on review of a critical area report demonstrating that the project is consistent with SMC 20.80.053(A)(2) through (6) and the following provisions:

1.    All development proposals on sites containing erosion hazard areas shall include a stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the requirements of the adopted stormwater manual and a mitigation plan to ensure revegetation and permanent stabilization of the site. Specific requirements for revegetation in mitigation plans shall be consistent with the mitigation plan requirements in SMC 20.80.082 and the mitigation performance standards for geologic hazard areas in SMC 20.80.250. Revegetation for site stabilization may be combined with required landscape, tree retention, and/or other critical area mitigation plans as appropriate.

2.    All subdivisions, short subdivisions or binding site plans on sites with erosion hazard areas shall comply with the following additional requirements:

a.    Except as provided in this section, existing vegetation shall be retained on all lots until building permits are approved for development on individual lots;

b.    If any vegetation on the lots is damaged or removed during construction of the subdivision infrastructure, the applicant shall be required to implement the revegetation plan in those areas that have been impacted prior to final inspection of the site development permit or the issuance of any building permit for the subject property;

c.    Clearing of vegetation on individual lots may be allowed prior to building permit approval if the City determines that:

i.    Such clearing is a necessary part of a large-scale grading plan,

ii.    It is not feasible to perform such grading on an individual lot basis, and

iii.    Drainage from the graded area will meet established water quality standards.

3.    Where the City determines that erosion from a development site poses a significant risk of damage to downstream receiving water, the applicant shall be required to provide regular monitoring of surface water discharge from the site during the project construction or installation. If the project does not meet water quality standards, the City may suspend further development work on the site until such standards are met.

4.    The City may require additional mitigation measures in erosion hazard areas, including, but not limited to, the restriction of major soil-disturbing activities associated with site development between October 1st and April 30th to meet the stated purpose contained in SMC 20.80.010 and 20.80.210.

5.    The use of hazardous substances, pesticides and fertilizers in erosion hazard areas may be prohibited by the City. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.230 Geologic hazard areas – Required buffer areas.

A.    Buffers for geologic hazard areas shall be maintained as undisturbed native vegetation consistent with SMC 20.80.090. Building and other improvement setbacks will be required in addition to buffers as recommended by the qualified professional to allow for landscaping, access around structures for maintenance, and location of stormwater facilities at safe distances from geologic hazard areas where native vegetation is not necessary to reduce the risk of the hazard.

B.    Required buffer widths for geologic hazard areas shall reflect the sensitivity of the hazard area and the risks associated with development and, in those circumstances permitted by these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity and site design proposed to be conducted on or near the area.

C.    In determining the appropriate buffer width, the City shall consider the recommendations contained in a geotechnical critical area report required by these regulations.

D.    For moderate to high risk landslide hazard areas, the qualified professional shall recommend whether buffers should be required and the width of those buffers, as well as recommending any additional setbacks for buildings and stormwater facilities adequate to certify no increase in the risk of the hazard.

E.    For very high risk landslide hazard areas, the standard buffer shall be 50 feet from all edges of the landslide hazard area. Larger buffers may be required as needed to eliminate or minimize the risk to people and property based on a geotechnical critical area report. The standard buffer may be reduced when geotechnical studies demonstrate, and the qualified professional certifies, that the reduction will not increase the risk of hazard to people or property, on or off site; however, the minimum buffer shall be 15 feet.

F.    Landslide hazard areas and associated buffers shall be placed either in a separate tract on which development is prohibited, protected by execution of an easement, dedicated to a conservation organization or land trust, or similarly preserved through a permanent protective mechanism acceptable to the City. The location and limitations associated with the critical landslide hazard and its buffer shall be shown on the face of the deed or plat applicable to the property and shall be recorded with the King County Recorder’s Office. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 3(C), 2000).

Subchapter 3.

Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas 


20.80.260 Fish and wildlife habitat – Description and purpose.

A.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas (or habitat conservation areas) are lands managed for maintaining populations of species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that the habitat available is sufficient to support viable populations over the long term and isolated subpopulations are not created. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas include areas with which State and Federal designated threatened, endangered, and sensitive species have a primary association as well as priority species and habitats listed by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, including corridors which connect priority habitat, and those areas which provide habitat for species of local significance, which have been or may be identified in the City of Shoreline Comprehensive Plan. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas also include stream areas and buffers which provide important habitat corridors; help maintain water quality; store and convey stormwater and floodwater; recharge ground water; and serve as areas for recreation, education, scientific study, and aesthetic appreciation.

B.    The purpose of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be to protect and conserve the habitat of fish and wildlife species and thereby maintain or increase their populations. The primary purpose of this section is to minimize development impacts to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and to:

1.    Protect Federal and State listed habitats and species and give special attention to protection and enhancement of anadromous fish populations; and

2.    Maintain a diversity of species and habitat within the City; and

3.    Coordinate habitat protection to maintain and provide habitat connections; and

4.    Help maintain air and water quality and control erosion. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 4(A), 2000).


20.80.270 Fish and wildlife habitat – Classification and designation.

A.    The City designates the following fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas that meet one or more of the criteria in subsection B of this section, regardless of any formal identification, as critical area, and, as such, these areas are subject to the provisions of this chapter. These areas shall be managed consistent with best available science; including the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Management Recommendations for Priority Habitat and Species. The following fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are specifically designated, and this designation does not preclude designation of additional areas as consistent with the criteria in subsection B of this section:

1.    All regulated streams and wetlands and their associated buffers as determined by a qualified specialist.

2.    The waters, bed and shoreline of Puget Sound up to the ordinary high water mark.

B.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are those areas designated by the City based on review of the best available science; input from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Washington Department of Ecology, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other agencies; and any of the following criteria:

1.    Areas Where State or Federally Designated Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species Have a Primary Association. 

a.    Federally designated endangered and threatened species are those fish and wildlife species identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service that are in danger of extinction or threatened to become endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service should be consulted for current listing status. Federally designated endangered and threatened species known to be identified and mapped by the Washington State Department of Wildlife in Shoreline include, but may not be limited to, the following:

i.    Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha);

ii.    Southern resident orca or killer whales (Orcinus orca).

b.    State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are those fish and wildlife species native to the State of Washington that are in danger of extinction, threatened to become endangered, vulnerable, or declining and are likely to become endangered or threatened in a significant portion of their range within the State without cooperative management or removal of threats as identified by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are periodically recorded in WAC 232-12-014 (State endangered species) and WAC 232-12-011 (State threatened and sensitive species). The State Department of Fish and Wildlife maintains the most current listing and should be consulted for current listing status. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species known to be identified and mapped by the Department of Fish and Wildlife in Shoreline include, but may not be limited to, the following:

i.    Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis);

ii.    Purple martin (Progne subis).

2.    State Priority Habitats and Species. Priority habitats and species are considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status, sensitivity to habitat alteration, and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) in the Priority Habitats and Species List. Priority habitats and species known to be identified and mapped by the Department of Fish and Wildlife in Shoreline include, but may not be limited to, the following:

a.    Biodiversity areas and corridors identified and mapped along Boeing Creek and in and around Innis Arden Reserve Park;

b.    Chinook/fall chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha);

c.    Coho (Oncrhynchus kisutch);

d.    Dungeness crab (Cancer magister);

e.    Estuarine intertidal aquatic habitat;

f.    Geoduck (Panopea abrupta);

g.    Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis);

h.    Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus);

i.    Purple martin (Progne subis);

j.    Resident coastal cutthroat (Oncorhynchus clarki);

k.    Surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosus);

l.    Waterfowl concentrations at Ronald Bog (Ronald Bog is not a shoreline of the State subject to the SMP); and

m.    Winter steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

3.    Commercial and Recreational Shellfish Areas. These areas include all public and private tidelands or bedlands suitable for shellfish harvest, including shellfish protection districts established pursuant to Chapter 90.72 RCW.

4.    Kelp and eelgrass beds and herring and smelt spawning areas.

5.    Waters of the State. Waters of the State include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the State of Washington, as classified in WAC 222-16-030. Streams are those areas where surface waters produce a defined channel or bed, not including irrigation ditches, canals, storm or surface water runoff devices or other entirely artificial watercourses, unless they are used by fish or are used to convey streams naturally occurring prior to construction. A channel or bed need not contain water year-round; provided, that there is evidence of at least intermittent flow during years of normal rainfall. Streams shall be classified in accordance with the Washington Department of Natural Resources water typing system (WAC 222-16-030) hereby adopted in its entirety by reference and summarized as follows:

a.    Type S: streams inventoried as “shorelines of the State” under Chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW;

b.    Type F: streams which contain fish habitat. Not all streams that are known to exist with fish habitat support anadromous fish populations, or have the potential for anadromous fish occurrence because of obstructions, blockages or access restrictions resulting from existing conditions. Therefore, in order to provide special consideration of and increased protection for anadromous fish in the application of development standards, shoreline streams shall be further classified as follows:

i.    Anadromous Fish-Bearing Streams (Type F-Anadromous). These streams include:

(A)    Fish-bearing streams where naturally recurring use by anadromous fish populations has been documented by a government agency;

(B)    Streams that are fish passable or have the potential to be fish passable by anadromous populations, including those from Lake Washington or Puget Sound, as determined by a qualified professional based on review of stream flow, gradient and natural barriers (i.e., natural features that exceed jumping height for salmonids), and criteria for fish passability established by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; and

(C)    Streams that are planned for restoration in a six-year capital improvement plan adopted by a government agency or planned for removal of the private dams that will result in a fish-passable connection to Lake Washington or Puget Sound; and

ii.    Nonanadromous Fish-Bearing Streams (Type F-Nonanadromous). These include streams which contain existing or potential fish habitat, but do not have the potential for anadromous fish use due to natural barriers to fish passage, including streams that contain resident or isolated fish populations.

The general areas and stream reaches with access for anadromous fish are indicated in the City of Shoreline Stream and Wetland Inventory and Assessment (2004) and basin plans. The potential for anadromous fish access shall be confirmed in the field by a qualified professional as part of a critical area report;

c.    Type Np: perennial nonfish habitat streams;

d.    Type Ns: seasonal nonfish habitat streams; and

e.    Piped stream segments: those segments of streams, regardless of their type, that are fully enclosed in an underground pipe or culvert. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 4(B), 2000).


20.80.272 Fish and wildlife habitat – Mapping.

The stream and buffer area shall include habitat improvements and measures to prevent erosion, landslide, and water quality impacts. Opened channels shall be designed to support fish and wildlife habitat and uninhibited fish access, unless determined to be unfeasible as demonstrated in a restoration plan reviewed and approved by the City;

b.    Removal of pipes conveying streams shall only occur when the City determines that the proposal will result in an improvement of water quality and ecological functions and will not significantly increase the threat of erosion, flooding, slope stability, or other hazards; and

c.    Where the buffer of the restored stream would extend onto an adjacent property, the applicant shall obtain a written agreement from the affected neighboring property owner prior to the City approving the restoration of the piped watercourse.

E.    Priority Species. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or buffers with which species that are not State or Federally listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive species and are not anadromous fish species shall be subject to the following:

1.    Development activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in priority species habitat areas and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area(s) report and habitat management plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of habitat and buffer areas shall be provided in compliance with the mitigation performance standards and requirements of these regulations. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.280 Fish and wildlife habitat – Required buffer areas.

A.    Buffer widths for fish and wildlife habitat areas shall be based on consideration of the following factors: species-specific recommendations of the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife; recommendations contained in a habitat management plan submitted by a qualified professional; and the nature and intensity of land uses and activities occurring on the land adjacent to the site.

B.    Low-impact uses and activities which are consistent with the purpose and function of the habitat buffer and do not detract from its integrity may be permitted within the buffer depending on the sensitivity of the habitat area. Examples of uses and activities which may be permitted in appropriate cases include trails that are pervious, viewing platforms, low-impact stormwater management facilities such as bioswales and other similar uses and activities; provided, that any impacts to the buffer resulting from such permitted facilities shall be fully mitigated.

C.    Standard Required Stream Buffer Widths. Buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the stream type, the risks associated with development and, in those circumstances permitted by these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity and site design proposed to be conducted on or near the stream area. Stream buffers shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) or the top of the bank, if the OHWM cannot be determined. Buffers shall be measured with rounded ends where streams enter or exit piped segments.

1.    The following buffers are established for streams based upon the Washington State Department of Natural Resources water typing system and further classification based on anadromous or nonanadromous fish presence for the Type F streams:

 

Table 20.80.280(1) 

	Stream Type	Standard Buffer Width (ft)

	Type S	150

	Type F-anadromous	115

	Type F-nonanadromous	75

	Type Np	65

	Type Ns	45

	Piped Stream Segments	10

2.    Increased Stream Buffer Widths. The recommended stream buffer widths shall be increased, as follows:

a.    When the qualified professional determines that the recommended width is insufficient to prevent habitat degradation and to protect the structure and functions of the habitat area;

b.    When the flood hazard area exceeds the recommended stream buffer width, the stream buffer area shall extend to the outer edge of the flood hazard area;

c.    When a channel migration zone is present, the stream buffer width shall be measured from the outer edge of the channel migration zone;

d.    When the habitat area is in an area of high blowdown potential, the stream buffer width shall be expanded an additional 50 feet on the windward side; or

e.    When the habitat area is within an erosion or landslide hazard area, or buffer, the stream buffer width shall be the recommended distance, or the erosion or landslide hazard area or buffer, whichever is greater.

3.    Stream Buffer Width Averaging with Enhancement. The Director may allow the recommended stream buffer width to be reduced in accordance with an approved critical area report and the best available science, on a case-by-case basis, by averaging buffer widths. Any allowance for averaging buffer widths shall only be granted based on the development and implementation of a buffer enhancement plan for areas of buffer degradation, consistent with the provisions in subsection (C)(4) of this section. Only those portions of the stream buffer existing within the project area or subject parcel shall be considered in the total buffer area for buffer averaging. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified professional demonstrates that:

a.    The width reduction and buffer enhancement plan provides evidence that the stream or habitat functions, including those of nonfish habitat and riparian wildlife, will be:

i.    Increased or maintained through plan implementation for those streams where existing buffer vegetation is generally intact native vegetation; or

ii.    Increased through plan implementation for those streams where existing buffer vegetation is inadequate to protect the functions and values of the stream;

b.    The total area contained in the buffer area of each stream on the development proposal site is not decreased after averaging;

c.    The recommended riparian habitat area width is not reduced by more than 25 percent in any one location; and

d.    The width reduction will not be located within another critical area or associated buffer.

4.    Stream Buffer Enhancement Measures. The measures determined most applicable and/or appropriate will be considered in buffer averaging requirements. These include but are not limited to:

a.    Removal of fish barriers to restore accessibility to fish.

b.    Enhancement of fish habitat using log structures incorporated as part of a fish habitat enhancement plan.

c.    Enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat structures that are likely to be used by wildlife, including wood duck houses, bat boxes, nesting platforms, snags, rootwads/stumps, birdhouses, and heron nesting areas.

d.    Additional enhancement measures may include:

i.    Planting native vegetation within the buffer area, especially vegetation that would increase value for fish and wildlife, increase stream bank or slope stability, improve water quality, or provide aesthetic/recreational value; or

ii.    Creation of a surface channel where a stream was previously underground, in a culvert or pipe. Surface channels which are “daylighted” shall be located within a buffer area and shall be designed with energy dissipating functions or channel roughness features such as meanders and rootwads to reduce future bank failures or nearby flooding;

iii.    Removal or modification of existing stream culverts (such as at road crossings) to improve fish passage, stream habitat, and flow capabilities; or

iv.    Upgrading of retention/detention facilities or other drainage facilities beyond required levels.

D.    Stream Buffer Allowed Uses and Alteration. Activities and uses shall be prohibited in stream buffers, except as provided for in this chapter. Stream buffers shall be maintained as undisturbed or restored natural vegetation. No clearing or grading activities are allowed within required stream buffers except as allowed under SMC 20.80.030, 20.80.040, 20.80.274, or consistent with an approved buffer enhancement plan consistent with the provisions of this subchapter. No structures or improvements shall be permitted within the stream buffer area, including buildings, decks, docks, except as otherwise permitted or required under the Shoreline Master Program, SMC Title 20, Division II, or under one of the following circumstances:

1.    Approved Mitigation. When the improvements are part of an approved rehabilitation or mitigation plan; or

2.    No Feasible Alternative. Construction of new roads, utilities, and accessory structures, when no feasible alternative location exists; or

3.    Trails. Construction of trails over and in the buffer of piped stream segments, and the construction of trails near other stream segments, consistent with the following criteria:

a.    Trails should be constructed of pervious surface, with preference for natural materials. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings may be acceptable;

b.    Trails shall be designed in a manner that minimizes impact on the stream system;

c.    Trails shall have a maximum trail corridor width of five feet; and

d.    Trails should be located within the outer 25 percent of the buffer, i.e., that portion of the buffer that is farther away from the stream and located to avoid removal of significant trees; or

4.    Footbridges. Construction of footbridges that minimize the impact to the stream system; or

5.    Informational Signs. Construction and placement of informational signs or educational demonstration facilities limited to no more than one square yard surface area and four feet high, provided there is no permanent infringement on stream flow; or

6.    Stormwater Management Facilities. Establishment of low-impact stormwater management facilities, such as stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales, may be allowed within stream buffers consistent with the adopted stormwater manual; provided, that:

a.    No other location is feasible;

b.    Pipes and conveyance facilities only in the outer 25 percent of the standard buffer area as set forth in Table 20.80.280(1);

c.    Stormwater dispersion outfalls, bioswales, bioretention facilities, and other low-impact facilities consistent with the adopted stormwater manual may be allowed anywhere within stream buffers when determined by a qualified professional that the location of the facility will enhance the buffer area and protect the stream; and

d.    Such facilities are designed consistent with the requirements of SMC 20.70.330.

7.    Development Proposals within Physically Separated and Functionally Isolated Stream Buffers. Consistent with the definition of “buffers” (SMC 20.20.012), areas that are functionally isolated and physically separated from stream due to existing, legally established roadways and railroads or other legally established structures or paved areas eight feet or more in width that occur between the area in question and the stream shall be considered physically isolated and functionally separated stream buffers. Once determined by the Director, based on a submitted critical area report to be a physically separated and functionally isolated stream buffer, development proposals shall be allowed in these areas. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 4(C), 2000).


20.80.290 Fish and wildlife habitat – Critical area report requirements.

5.    Detailed surface and subsurface hydrologic features both on and adjacent to the site. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.300 Fish and wildlife habitat – Mitigation performance standards and requirements.

A.    Requirements for Mitigation. Where impacts cannot be avoided, and the applicant has exhausted all feasible design alternatives, the applicant or property owner shall seek to implement other appropriate mitigation actions in compliance with the intent, standards and criteria of this section. Mitigation provisions shall be applied through the critical area reasonable use or critical area special use provisions in SMC 20.30.333 and 20.30.336, or subject to the provisions of the Shoreline Master Program, SMC Title 20, Division II, where the proposed development activity is located within the shoreline jurisdiction, unless mitigated alterations are specifically allowed by the provisions of this subchapter. In an individual case, these actions may include consideration of alternative site plans and layouts, reductions in the density or scope of the proposal, and/or implementation of the performance standards listed in this section.

B.    Additional Requirements for Stream Mitigation. Significant adverse impacts to stream area functions and values shall be mitigated. Mitigation actions shall be implemented in the preferred sequence: avoidance, minimization, restoration and replacement. Proposals which include less preferred and/or compensatory mitigation shall demonstrate that:

1.    All feasible and reasonable measures will be taken to reduce impacts and losses to the stream, or to avoid impacts where avoidance is required by these regulations;

2.    The restored, created or enhanced stream area or buffer will be available and persistent as the stream or buffer area it replaces; and

3.    No overall net loss will occur in stream functions and values.

C.    Compensating for Lost or Impacted Functions. Mitigation of alterations to fish and wildlife habitat shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic and hydrologic functions and shall include mitigation for adverse impacts upstream or downstream of the development proposal site on a per function basis. Mitigation shall be located on site except when demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an off-site location. A mitigation plan may include the following:

1.    Native vegetation planting plan;

2.    Retention, enhancement or restoration plan of specific habitat features;

3.    Plans for control of nonnative invasive plant or wildlife species; and

4.    Stipulations for use of innovative, sustainable building practices.

D.    Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for fish and wildlife habitat functions and values shall be approached in the following order of preference:

1.    Protection. Mitigation measures that increase the protection of the identified fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas may include but are not limited to:

a.    Increased or enhanced buffers;

b.    Setbacks for permanent and temporary structures;

c.    Reduced project scope;

d.    Limitations on construction hours;

e.    Limitations on hours of operation; and/or

f.    Relocation of access;

2.    Restoration. Restoration of degraded habitat.

3.    Creation. Creation (establishment) of wildlife habitat on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species. This should be attempted only when the site conditions are conducive to the habitat type that is anticipated in the design.

4.    Enhancement. Enhancement of significantly degraded habitat in combination with restoration or creation. Enhancement alone will result in a loss of habitat acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions lost. Enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

5.    Preservation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk fish and wildlife habitat as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk fish and wildlife habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for habitat impacts when the following criteria are met:

a.    Habitat impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish, or other ESA-listed species;

b.    There is no net loss of habitat functions and values within the watershed or basin;

c.    The impact area is small (generally less than one-half acre) and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system; and

d.    All preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions and values from encroachment and degradation.

E.    Location and Timing of Stream Mitigation.

1.    Mitigation shall be provided on site, unless on-site mitigation is not scientifically feasible due to the physical features of the property. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that mitigation cannot be provided on site.

2.    When mitigation cannot be provided on site, mitigation shall be provided in the immediate vicinity of the permitted activity on property owned or controlled by the applicant, such as an easement, provided such mitigation is beneficial to the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area and associated resources. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain title to off-site mitigation areas. Mitigation may be considered on City-owned property, or on similar publicly owned property for which title is not available, through a City mitigation program if programmatic mitigation areas have been identified by the City.

3.    In-kind mitigation shall be provided, except when the applicant demonstrates and the City concurs that greater functional and habitat value can be achieved through out-of-kind mitigation.

4.    Only when it is determined by the City that subsections (B)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are inappropriate and impractical shall off-site, out-of-kind mitigation be considered.

5.    When stream mitigation is permitted by these regulations on site or off site, the mitigation project shall occur near an adequate water supply (stream, ground water) with a hydrologic connection to the mitigation area to ensure successful development or restoration.

6.    Any agreed-upon mitigation proposal shall be completed prior to project construction, unless a phased schedule that assures completion concurrent with project construction has been approved by the City.

7.    Restored or created streams, where permitted by these regulations, shall be an equivalent or higher stream value or function than the altered stream.

F.    Performance Standards. The following mitigation measures shall be reflected in fish and wildlife habitat conservation area mitigation planning:

1.    The maintenance and protection of habitat functions and values shall be considered a priority in site planning and design;

2.    Buildings and structures shall be located in a manner that preserves and minimizes adverse impacts to important habitat areas. This may include clustering buildings and locating fences outside of habitat areas;

3.    Retained habitat shall be integrated into open space and landscaping;

4.    Where possible, habitat and vegetated open space shall be consolidated in contiguous blocks;

5.    Habitat shall be located contiguous to other habitat areas, open space, or landscaped areas, both on and off site, to contribute to a continuous system or corridor that provides connections to adjacent habitat areas;

6.    When planting is required, the following standards shall apply:

a.    Native species, indigenous to the region, shall be used in any landscaping of disturbed or undeveloped areas and in any enhancement of habitat or buffers;

b.    Plant selection shall be consistent with the existing or projected site conditions, including slope aspect, moisture, and shading;

c.    Plants should be commercially available or available from local sources;

d.    Plant species high in food and cover value for fish and wildlife shall be used;

e.    Mostly perennial species should be planted;

f.    Committing significant areas of the site to species that have questionable potential for successful establishment shall be avoided;

g.    Plant selection, densities, and placement of plants must be determined by a qualified professional and shown on the design plans;

h.    Stockpiling soil and construction materials should be confined to upland areas and contract specifications should limit stockpiling of earthen materials to durations in accordance with City clearing and grading standards, unless otherwise approved by the City;

i.    Planting instructions shall be submitted which describe placement, diversity, and spacing of seeds, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, sprigs, plugs, and transplanted stock;

j.    Controlled release fertilizer shall be applied (if required) at the time of planting and afterward only as plant conditions warrant as determined during the monitoring process;

k.    An irrigation system shall be installed, if necessary, for the initial establishment period;

l.    The heterogeneity and structural diversity of vegetation shall be emphasized in landscaping; and

m.    Significant trees shall be preserved;

7.    All construction specifications and methods shall be approved by a qualified professional and the City; and

8.    Construction management shall be provided by a qualified professional. Ongoing work on site shall be inspected by the City.

G.    Mitigation Plan. Mitigation plans shall be submitted as part of the required critical area report consistent with the requirements of SMC 20.80.080, 20.80.082, and 20.80.290 and this section. When revegetation is required as part of the mitigation, then the mitigation plan shall meet the standards of SMC 20.80.350(H), excluding those standards that are wetland specific.

H.    Monitoring Program and Contingency Plan. A monitoring program shall be implemented by the applicant to determine the success of the mitigation project and any necessary corrective actions. This program shall determine if the original goals and objectives are being met. The monitoring program will be established consistent with the guidelines contained in SMC 20.80.082(D). (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 4(E), 2000).

Subchapter 4.

Wetlands


20.80.310 Wetlands – Purpose.

A.    Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

    Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, bioswales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands.

B.    Wetlands help to maintain water quality; store and convey stormwater and floodwater; recharge ground water; provide important fish and wildlife habitat; and serve as areas for recreation, education, scientific study and aesthetic appreciation.

C.    The City’s overall goal shall be to achieve no net loss of wetlands. This goal shall be implemented through retention of the function, value and acreage of wetlands within the City. Wetland buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates; reduce sediment, chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants; provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures; provide habitat for wildlife; protect wetland resources from harmful intrusion; and generally preserve the ecological integrity of the wetland area.

D.    The primary purpose of the wetland regulations is to avoid detrimental wetland impacts and achieve a goal of no net loss of wetland function, value and acreage; and where possible enhance and restore wetlands. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 695 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 5(A), 2000).


20.80.320 Wetlands – Designation and rating.

A.    Designation. All areas meeting the definition of a wetland and identification criteria as wetlands pursuant to SMC 20.80.322, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter.

B.    Rating. All wetlands shall be rated by a qualified professional according to the current Washington State Department of Ecology wetland rating system, as set forth in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington 2014 (Ecology Publication No. 014-06-029, or as revised). Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the City, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities.

1.    Category I. Category I wetlands are those that represent unique or rare wetland types, are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands, are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime, or provide a high level of functions. The following types of wetlands are Category I:

a.    Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

b.    Wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR;

c.    Bogs;

d.    Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

e.    Wetlands in coastal lagoons; and

f.    Wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more based on functions).

2.    Category II. Category II wetlands are those that are difficult, though not impossible, to replace and provide high levels of some functions. The following types of wetlands are Category II:

a.    Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

b.    Interdunal wetlands larger than one acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands; and

c.    Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points).

3.    Category III. Category III wetlands are those with a moderate level of functions, generally have been disturbed in some ways, can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project, and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. The following types of wetlands are Category III:

a.    Wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); or

b.    Interdunal wetlands between 0.1 and one acre.

4.    Category IV. Category IV wetlands are those with the lowest levels of functions (scoring below 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be able to replace, or in some cases to improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and also need to be protected.

C.    Illegal Modifications. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications or alterations. A wetland’s category shall be based on the pre-modification/alteration analysis of the wetland.

D.    At the time of adoption of the updated critical areas regulations, Ordinance 723, there were no identified Category I wetlands identified within the City of Shoreline. If this category of wetland is subsequently identified, any applicable standards may be added or modified by the Director based on Washington State guidance on protection of the identified type of resource where the adopted regulations do not address the specified type of wetland. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 695 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 5(B), 2000).


20.80.322 Wetlands – Mapping and delineation.

A.    Mapping. The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown in the wetland data layer maintained in the City of Shoreline geographic information system (GIS). In addition, the following maps and inventories are hereby adopted by reference as amended:

1.    City of Shoreline, Basin Characterization Reports and Stream and Wetland Inventory and Assessment, Tetra Tech (May 2004);

2.    City of Shoreline stormwater basin plans as completed and updated;

3.    Soils maps produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Resources Conservation Service; and

4.    The National Wetlands Inventory, produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

B.    Reference Only. The inventories and cited resources are to be used as a guide for the City of Shoreline, project applicants, and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new wetlands are identified or critical area reports are submitted for known wetlands. They are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation.

C.    Identification and Delineation. Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved Federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements per WAC 173-22-035. The exact location of a wetland’s boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a qualified professional. Wetland delineations are valid for five years; after such date the Director shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary.

D.    Pre-assessment. To facilitate long-range planning using a landscape approach, the Director may identify and pre-assess wetlands using the rating system and establish appropriate wetland buffer widths for such wetlands. The Director will prepare maps of wetlands that have been pre-assessed in this manner. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.324 Wetlands – Development standards.

A.    Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this chapter.

B.    Activities Allowed in Wetlands. The activities listed below are allowed in wetlands. Exemptions are listed in the provisions established in SMC 20.80.030 and additional allowed activities in 20.80.040, but do not apply within the shoreline jurisdiction. These activities do not require submission of a critical area report, except where such activities result in a loss of the functions and values of a wetland or wetland buffer. These activities include:

1.    Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and/or other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing wetland.

2.    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

3.    Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a wetland, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column will be disturbed.

4.    Enhancement of a wetland through the select removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand labor and handheld equipment unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. Not more than 500 square feet of area may be cleared, as calculated cumulatively over one year, on private property without a permit. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and disposed of appropriately. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds or the King County Noxious Weed List must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.

5.    Permitted alteration to a legally constructed structure existing within a wetland or wetland buffer that does not increase the footprint of the development or hardscape or increase the impact to a wetland or wetland buffer.

C.    Category I Wetlands. Development activities and uses that result in alteration of Category I wetlands and their associated buffers shall be prohibited subject to the reasonable use provisions and special use provisions of SMC 20.30.333 and 20.30.336, unless otherwise allowed by the exemptions or allowed activities provisions of this chapter, or subject to the provisions of the Shoreline Master Program, SMC Title 20, Division II, where the proposed development activity is located within the shoreline jurisdiction.

D.    Category II and III Wetlands. Development activities and uses that result in alteration of Category II and III wetlands are prohibited, unless the applicant can demonstrate that:

1.    The basic project proposed cannot reasonably be accomplished on another site or sites in the general region while still successfully avoiding or resulting in less adverse impact on a wetland;

2.    All on-site alternative designs that would avoid or result in less adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction to the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project are not feasible; and

3.    Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions and values of wetland and buffers due to unavoidable impacts shall be provided in compliance with the mitigation performance standards and requirements of this chapter.

E.    Category IV Wetlands, Except Small Hydrologically Isolated Wetlands. Development activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in Category IV wetlands and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area(s) report and compensatory mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions and values of wetland and buffers shall be provided in compliance with the mitigation performance standards and requirements of these regulations.

F.    Small, Hydrologically Isolated Category IV Wetlands. The Director may allow small, hydrologically isolated Category IV wetlands to be exempt from the avoidance sequencing provisions of SMC 20.80.053 and subsection D of this section and allow alteration of such wetlands; provided, that a submitted critical area report and mitigation plan provides evidence that all of the following conditions are met:

1.    The wetland is less than 1,000 square feet in area;

2.    The wetland is a low quality Category IV wetland with a habitat score of less than three points in the adopted rating system;

3.    The wetland does not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife or species of local importance which are regulated as fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas in Chapter 20.80, Subchapter 3;

4.    The wetland is not associated with riparian areas or buffers;

5.    The wetland is not part of a wetland mosaic; and

6.    A mitigation plan to replace lost wetland functions and values is developed, approved, and implemented consistent with SMC 20.80.350.

G.    Subdivisions. The subdivision and/or short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers are subject to the following:

1.    Land that is located wholly within a wetland and/or its buffer may not be subdivided; and

2.    Land that is located partially within a wetland and/or its buffer may be subdivided; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is:

a.    Located outside of the wetland and its buffer; and

b.    Meets the minimum lot size requirements of SMC 20.50.020. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.330 Wetlands – Required buffer areas.

A.    Buffer Requirements. The standard buffer widths in Table 20.80.330(A)(1) have been established in accordance with the best available science. The buffer widths shall be determined based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as assigned by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington.

1.    The use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the mitigation measures in Table 20.80.330(A)(2), where applicable to the development type, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

2.    If an applicant chooses not to apply the appropriate mitigation measures in Table 20.80.330(A)(2), then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a 75-foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100-foot buffer without them.

3.    The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is a relatively intact native plant community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If the existing buffer is bare ground, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with nonnative or invasive species that do not perform needed functions, then the applicant must either develop and implement a wetland buffer restoration or enhancement plan to maintain the standard width to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer must be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

	Category III (all)	60 ft	105 ft	165 ft	225 ft

	Category IV (all)	40 ft (no change based on habitat scores)



Table 20.80.330(A)(2) Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands (Measures are required, where applicable to a specific proposal)  

	Disturbance	Activities and Uses That Cause Disturbances	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	•    Parking lots

•    Warehouses

•    Manufacturing

•    Residential	•    Direct lights away from wetland.

	Noise	•    Manufacturing

•    Residential	•    Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland.

•    If warranted, enhance existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source.

•    For activities that generate relatively continuous, potentially disruptive noise, such as certain heavy industry or mining, establish an additional 10 ft heavily vegetated buffer strip immediately adjacent to the outer wetland buffer.

	Toxic runoff*	•    Parking lots

•    Roads

•    Manufacturing

•    Residential areas

•    Application of agricultural pesticides

•    Landscaping	•    Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered.

•    Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides and fertilizers within 150 ft of wetland.

•    Apply integrated pest management.

	Stormwater runoff	•    Parking lots

•    Roads

•    Manufacturing

•    Residential areas

•    Commercial

•    Landscaping	•    Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development.

•    Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer.

•    Use low intensity development techniques (per PSAT publication on LID techniques).

	Change in water regime	•    Impermeable surfaces

•    Lawns

•    Tilling	•    Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns.

	Pets and human disturbance	•    Residential areas	•    Use privacy fencing OR plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion.

•    Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement.

	Dust	•    Tilled fields	•    Use best management practices to control dust.

	Disruption of corridors or connections	 	•    Maintain connections to off-site areas that are undisturbed.

•    Restore corridors.

	* These examples are not necessarily adequate for minimizing toxic runoff if threatened or endangered species are present at the site. Additional mitigation measures may be required based on recommendation of a qualified professional, third party review, or State agency recommendations.

4.    Increased Wetland Buffer Area Width. Buffer widths shall be increased, on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Director, when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values. This determination shall be supported by a critical area report, prepared by a qualified professional at the applicant’s expense, showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the wetland. The critical area report must include, but not be limited to, the following criteria:

a.    The wetland is used by a plant or animal species listed by the Federal government or the State as endangered, threatened, candidate, sensitive, monitored, or documented priority species or habitats, or the wetland is essential or outstanding habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or

b.    The adjacent land has slopes greater than 15 percent and is susceptible to severe erosion, and erosion-control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or

c.    The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover. In lieu of increasing the buffer width where exiting buffer vegetation is inadequate to protect the wetland functions and values, development and implementation of a wetland buffer restoration/enhancement plan in accordance with SMC 20.80.350 may be substituted.

5.    Buffer averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

a.    The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or is a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower rated area;

b.    The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower functioning or less sensitive portion as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional;

c.    The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either three-fourths of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

6.    Averaging, through a critical area reasonable use permit consistent with SMC 20.30.333 or critical area special use permit consistent with SMC 20.30.336 or a shoreline variance consistent with 20.220.040, may be permitted when all of the following are met:

a.    There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging;

b.    The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional;

c.    The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either three-fourths of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

B.    Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

C.    Buffers on Mitigation Sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter. Buffers shall be based on the expected or target category of the proposed wetland mitigation site.

D.    Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. In the case of compensatory mitigation sites, removal of invasive nonnative weeds is required for the duration of the required monitoring period.

E.    Impacts to Buffers. Requirements for the compensation for impacts to buffers are outlined in SMC 20.80.350.

F.    Overlapping Critical Area Buffers. If buffers for two contiguous critical areas overlap (such as buffers for a stream and a wetland), the wider buffer applies.

G.    Allowed Wetland Buffer Uses. The following uses may be allowed within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this chapter; provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

1.    Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife.

2.    Passive Recreation. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:

a.    Walkways and trails; provided, that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings may be acceptable; and/or

b.    Wildlife viewing structures.

3.    Educational and scientific research activities.

4.    Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way, provided, that the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or use of the facility or right-of-way.

5.    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops, and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

6.    Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a buffer, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer boundary; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column is disturbed.

7.    Enhancement of a wetland through the select removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand labor and handheld equipment unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. Not more than 1,500 square feet of area may be cleared, as calculated cumulatively over one year, on private property without a permit. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and disposed of appropriately. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds or the King County Noxious Weed List must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.

8.    Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities are limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls, bioswales, and other low-impact facilities consistent with the adopted stormwater manual. They may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only; provided, that:

a.    No other location is feasible;

b.    The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland; and

c.    Stormwater management facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands.

9.    Nonconforming Uses. Repair and maintenance of nonconforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided they do not increase the degree of nonconformity.

10.    Development Proposals within Physically Separated and Functionally Isolated Wetland Buffers. Consistent with the definition of “buffers” (SMC 20.20.012), areas that are functionally isolated and physically separated from wetland due to existing, legally established roadways, paved trails eight feet or more in width, or other legally established structures or paved areas eight feet or more in width that occur between the area in question and the wetland shall be considered physically isolated and functionally separated wetland buffers. Once determined by the Director, based on a submitted critical area report to be a physically separated and functionally isolated wetland buffer, development proposals shall be allowed in these areas.

H.    Signs and Fencing of Wetlands and Buffers.

1.    Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland buffer and the clearing limits identified by an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field with temporary “clearing limits” fencing in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur. The marking is subject to inspection by the Director prior to the commencement of permitted activities during the preconstruction meeting required under SMC 20.50.330(E). This temporary marking and fencing shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

2.    Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the Director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer, when recommended in a critical area report or otherwise required by the provisions of this chapter.

a.    Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post or another nontreated material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The signs shall be worded consistent with the text specified in SMC 20.80.110 or with alternative language approved by the Director.

b.    The provisions of subsection (H)(2)(a) of this section may be modified as necessary to assure protection of sensitive features.

3.    Fencing. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. Permanent fencing shall be required at the outer edge of the critical area buffer under the following circumstances; provided, that the Director may waive this requirement:

a.    As part of any development proposal for subdivisions, short plats, multifamily, mixed use, and commercial development where the Director determines that such fencing is necessary to protect the functions of the critical area; provided, that breaks in permanent fencing may be allowed for access to permitted buffer uses (subsection G of this section);

b.    As part of development proposals for parks where the adjacent proposed use is active recreation and the Director determines that such fencing is necessary to protect the functions of the critical area;

c.    When buffer averaging is part of a development proposal;

d.    When buffer reductions are part of a development proposal; or

e.    At the Director’s discretion to protect the values and functions of a critical area as demonstrated in a critical area report. If found to be necessary, the Director shall condition any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the habitat conservation area or buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the habitat conservation area;

f.    The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland buffer when domestic grazing animals, only as allowed under SMC 20.40.240, are present or may be introduced on site. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 695 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 469 § 1, 2007; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 5(C), 2000).


20.80.340 Wetlands – Critical area report requirements.

A.    Report Required. If the Director determines that the site of a proposed development includes, is likely to include, or is adjacent to, a wetland, a wetland critical area report shall be required. Critical area report requirements for wetland areas are generally met through submission to the Director of one or more wetland critical area reports. In addition to the general critical area report requirements of SMC 20.80.080, critical area reports for wetlands must meet the requirements of this section. Critical area reports for two or more types of critical areas must meet the report requirements for each relevant type of critical area.

B.    Preparation by a Qualified Professional. Critical area reports for wetlands shall be prepared and signed by a qualified professional who is a certified wetland scientist or a noncertified wetland scientist with the minimum required experience, per SMC 20.20.042, in the field of wetland science and with experience preparing wetland delineation, impact assessments, and mitigation plans.

C.    Third Party Review Required. Critical areas studies and reports on wetland areas shall be subject to third party review consistent with SMC 20.80.080(C) and in any of the additional following circumstances:

1.    Compensatory mitigation is required for impacts to Category I, II, or III wetlands and or buffers; or

2.    Compensatory mitigation is required for impacts to Category IV wetlands.

D.    Minimum Report Contents for Wetlands. The written critical area report(s) and accompanying plan sheet(s) shall contain the following information, at a minimum:

1.    The minimum report contents required per SMC 20.80.080(E);

2.    Documentation of any fieldwork performed on the site, including field data sheets for delineations, rating system forms, baseline hydrologic data, site photos, etc.;

3.    A description of the methodologies used to conduct the wetland delineations, ratings, or impact analyses including references;

4.    Site Plans. A copy of the site plan sheet(s) for the project must be included with the written report and must include, at a minimum:

a.    Maps (to scale) depicting delineated and surveyed wetland(s) and required buffers on site, including buffers for off-site critical areas that extend onto the project site; the development proposal; other critical areas; clearing and grading limits; areas of proposed impacts to wetlands and/or buffers (include square footage estimates); and

b.    A depiction of the proposed stormwater management facilities and outlets (to scale) for the development, including estimated areas of intrusion into the buffers of any critical areas. The written report shall contain a discussion of the potential impacts to the wetland(s) associated with anticipated hydroperiod alterations from the project;

5.    For each wetland identified on site and off site within 300 feet of the project site provide: the wetland rating, including a description of and score for each function, per wetland ratings (SMC 20.80.320(B)); required buffers (SMC 20.80.330); hydrogeomorphic classification; wetland acreage based on a professional survey from the field delineation (acreages for on-site portion and entire wetland area including off-site portions); Cowardin classification of vegetation communities; habitat elements; soil conditions based on site assessment and/or soil survey information; and to the extent possible, hydrologic information such as location and condition of inlet/outlets (if they can be legally accessed), estimated water depths within the wetland, and estimated hydroperiod patterns based on visual cues (e.g., algal mats, drift lines, flood debris, etc.). Provide acreage estimates, classifications, and ratings based on entire wetland complexes, not only the portion present on the proposed project site;

6.    A description of the proposed actions, including an estimation of acreages of impacts to wetlands and buffers based on the field delineation and survey and an analysis of site development alternatives, including a no-development alternative;

9.    A conservation strategy for habitat and native vegetation that addresses methods to protect and enhance on-site habitat and wetland functions; and

10.    An evaluation of the functions of the wetland and adjacent buffer. Include reference for the method used and data sheets.

E.    Additional Information. When appropriate due to the proposed impacts or the project area conditions, the Director may also require the critical area report to include:

1.    Where impacts are proposed, mitigation plans consistent with the requirements of SMC 20.80.082 and the wetland mitigation performance standards and requirements of SMC 20.80.350;

2.    A request for consultation with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), local Native American Indian tribes, and/or other appropriate agency;

3.    Copies of the joint aquatic resource permit application (JARPA) and related approvals, such as a hydraulic project approval (HPA) from the DFW, when applicable to the project; and

4.    Detailed surface and subsurface hydrologic features both on and adjacent to the site. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).


20.80.350 Wetlands – Compensatory mitigation performance standards and requirements.

A.    Requirements for Compensatory Mitigation.

1.    Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1), (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, March 2006, or as revised).

2.    Mitigation ratios shall be consistent with subsection E of this section.

3.    Mitigation requirements may also be determined using the credit/debit tool described in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Operational Draft” (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, February 2011, or as revised) consistent with subsection E of this section.

B.    Compensating for Lost or Impacted Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the functions and values affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions and values. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions and values as those lost, except when either:

1.    The lost wetland provides minimal functions and values, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions and values or will provide functions and values shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

2.    Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions and values will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the City, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

C.    Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions and values shall be approached in the following order of preference:

1.    Restoration. Restoration of wetlands.

2.    Creation. Creation (establishment) of wetlands on disturbed upland sites, such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species. This should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design.

3.    Enhancement. Enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation. Enhancement alone will result in a loss of wetland acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions and values lost. Enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

4.    Preservation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met:

a.    Wetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish, or other ESA-listed species;

b.    There is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin;

c.    Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost;

d.    The impact area is small (generally less than one-half acre) and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system (Category III or IV wetland); and

e.    All preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation.

D.    Type and Location of Compensatory Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternative approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in kind and on site, or in kind and within the same stream reach, sub-basin, or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted). Compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration, except when all of the following apply:

1.    There are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Considerations should include:

a.    Anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation;

b.    Buffer conditions and proposed widths;

c.    Available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored; and

d.    Proposed flood storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

2.    Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland;

3.    Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin, unless watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the City and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; and

4.    The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape). Therefore, compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration, or enhancement of an atypical wetland. An atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland (e.g., created or enhanced) that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site (i.e., the water source(s) and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting). Likewise, it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water. For example, excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing, seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland. Another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope, which would require the construction of berms to hold the water.

E.    Wetland Mitigation Ratios1.

Table 20.80.350(G). Wetland mitigation ratios apply when impacts to wetlands cannot be avoided or are otherwise allowed consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 

	Category and Type of Wetland2	Creation or Reestablishment (Area – in square feet)	Rehabilitation (Area – in square feet)	Enhancement (Area – in square feet)	Preservation (Area – in square feet)

	Category I: Based on total score for functions	4:1	8:1	16:1	20:1

	Category I: Mature forested	6:1	12:1	24:1	24:1

	Category I: Estuarine	Case-by-case	6:1	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

	Category II: Based on total score for functions	3:1	6:1	12:1	20:1

	Category III (all)	2:1	4:1	8:1	15:1

	Category IV (all)	1.5:1	3:1	6:1	10:1

Aquifer Recharge Areas


20.80.420 Aquifer recharge – Description and purpose.

A.    Aquifer recharge areas provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream discharge during periods of low flow. Urban-type pollutants may enter watercourse supplies through potential infiltration of pollutants through the soil to ground water aquifers.

B.    The primary purpose of aquifer recharge area regulations is to protect aquifer recharge areas by providing for regulation of land use activities that pose a risk of potential aquifer contamination and to minimize impacts through the application of strict performance standards. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 7(A), 2000).


20.80.430 Aquifer recharge – Designation and classification.

A.    Aquifer recharge areas shall be designated and classified based on the soil and ground water conditions and risks to surface water during periods of low hydrology. Classification depends on the combined effects of hydrogeological susceptibility to contamination and contaminant loading potential, and includes upland areas underlain by soils consisting largely of silt, clay or glacial till, upland areas underlain by soils consisting largely of sand and gravel, and wellhead protection areas and areas underlain by soils consisting largely of sand and gravel in which there is a predominantly downward or lateral component to ground water flow.

B.    At the time of adoption of the updated critical areas regulations, Ordinance 723, there were no identified critical aquifer recharge areas within the City of Shoreline. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 7(B), 2000).


20.80.440 Aquifer recharge – Alteration.

The following land uses and activities shall require implementation of best management practices (BMPs) as established by the Department of Ecology:

A.    Land uses and activities that involve the use, storage, transport or disposal of significant quantities of chemicals, substances or materials that are toxic, dangerous or hazardous, as those terms are defined by State and Federal regulations.

B.    On-site community sewage disposal systems.

C.    Underground storage of chemicals.

D.    Petroleum pipelines.

E.    Solid waste landfills.

F.    Stormwater management, including infiltration, and ground water recharge. (Ord. 723 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 398 § 1, 2006; Ord. 238 Ch. VIII § 7(C), 2000).


20.80.450 Aquifer recharge – Performance standards and requirements.

Any uses or activities located in an aquifer recharge area, as defined within this subchapter, that involve the use, storage, transport or disposal of significant quantities of chemicals, substances, or materials that are toxic, dangerous or hazardous, as those terms are defined by State and Federal regulations, shall comply with the following additional standards:

A.    Underground storage of chemicals, substances or materials that are toxic, hazardous or dangerous is discouraged.

B.    Any chemicals, substances or materials that are toxic, hazardous or dangerous shall be segregated and stored in receptacles or containers that meet State and Federal standards.

C.    Storage containers shall be located in a designated, secured area that is paved and able to contain leaks and spills, and shall be surrounded by a containment dike.

D.    Secondary containment devices shall be constructed around storage areas to retard the spread of any spills and a monitoring system should be implemented.

E.    A written operations plan shall be developed, including procedures for loading/unloading liquids and for training of employees in proper materials handling.

F.    An emergency response/spill clean-up plan shall be prepared and employees properly trained to react to accidental spills.

G.    Any aboveground storage tanks shall be located within a diked containment area on an impervious surface. The tanks shall include overfill protection systems and positive controls on outlets to prevent uncontrolled discharges.

H.    Development should be clustered and impervious surfaces limited where possible.

I.    No waste liquids or chemicals of any kind shall be discharged to storm sewers.

J.    All development shall implement best management practices (BMPs) for water quality, as approved by the City, including the standards contained within the adopted stormwater manual, such as biofiltration swales and use of oil-water separators, and BMPs appropriate to the particular use proposed.

Water-Dependent Use. A use or portion of a use that cannot exist in a location that is not adjacent to the water, but is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations.

Water-Enjoyment Use. A recreational or other use that facilitates public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use; or a use that provides for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of people as a general characteristic of the use and which through location, design, and operation ensures the public’s ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline. In order to qualify as a water enjoyment use, the use must be open to the general public and the shoreline-oriented space within the project must be devoted to the specific aspects of the use that foster shoreline enjoyment.

Water-Oriented Use. A use that is water-dependent, water-related, or water enjoyment, or a combination of such uses.

Water Quality. The physical characteristics of water within shoreline jurisdiction, including water quantity, hydrological, physical, chemical, aesthetic, recreation-related, and biological characteristics.

Water Quantity. Refers only to development and uses regulated under this Master Program and affecting water quantity, such as impermeable surfaces and stormwater handling practices. Water quantity, for purposes of this Master Program, does not mean the withdrawal of ground water or diversion of surface water pursuant to RCW 90.03.250 through 90.03.340, as amended from time to time.

Water-Related Use. A use or portion of a use that is not intrinsically dependent on a waterfront location, but whose economic viability is dependent upon a waterfront location because: (A) the use has a functional requirement for a waterfront location such as the arrival or shipment of materials by water or the need for large quantities of water; or (B) the use provides a necessary service supportive of the water-dependent uses and the proximity of the use to its customers makes its services less expensive and/or more convenient.

Wave Return. A structure added on top of, or part of, an existing bulkhead or hard armoring that redirects wave action back waterward and helps prevent water from splashing landward, thereby protecting the armoring itself, and landward items such as natural ecology and other structures.

Weir. A dam in a watercourse, usually a stream or river, to raise the water level or divert its flow.

Wetland Delineation. A technical procedure performed by a wetland specialist pursuant to the manual adopted by the Department of Ecology pursuant to RCW 90.58.380, as amended from time to time, to determine the area of a wetland, ascertaining the wetland’s classification, function, and value, and to define the boundary between a wetland and adjacent uplands.

Wetlands. Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).

C.    The Director is authorized to approve a shoreline variance from the bulk, dimensional, or performance standards of this Master Program only when all of the criteria enumerated in WAC 173-27-170 are met, as amended from time to time.

D.    Prior to approval of any shoreline variance, the Director shall consider the cumulative environmental impacts of previous, existing, and possible future requests for like actions in the area. The total effects of approved shoreline variances should remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020, as amended from time to time, and this Master Program and shall not produce significant adverse effects to the shoreline ecological functions, processes, or other users.

E.    Before making a determination to approve a shoreline variance, the Director shall consider issues related to the conservation of valuable natural resources and the protection of views from public lands.

F.    Shoreline variance requests based on the applicant’s/proponent’s desire to enhance the view from the subject development may be granted where there are no likely detrimental effects to existing or future users, views from public lands, critical areas, other features or shoreline ecological functions and/or processes, and where reasonable alternatives of equal or greater consistency with this program are not available.

G.    A shoreline variance shall not be granted:

1.    When it would allow a greater height or lesser shoreline setback than what is typical for the area immediately surrounding the development site.

2.    When it seeks relief from the use regulations of the Master Program.

H.    A variance issued per SMC 20.30.310 shall not be construed to mean approval of a shoreline variance from Master Program use regulations.

I.    An issued shoreline variance does not provide relief from the variance requirements under SMC 20.30.310. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.220.050 Shoreline conditional use permit.

The purpose of a shoreline conditional use permit is to allow greater flexibility in the application of the use regulations of the Master Program in a manner consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020, as amended from time to time.

A.    The applicant for a shoreline conditional use permit must demonstrate that all of the criteria in WAC 173-27-160 are met, as amended from time to time.

B.    Shoreline conditional use permits should be granted in a circumstance where denial of the permit would result in a conflict with the policies enumerated in RCW 90.58.020, as amended from time to time.

C.    The Director is authorized to issue shoreline conditional use permits only when all the criteria enumerated in WAC 173-27-160 are met, as amended from time to time.

1.    In granting conditional use permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area.

2.    In authorizing a shoreline conditional use, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the Director or by the Department of Ecology to minimize the effects of the proposed use. Uses that are specifically prohibited by the Master Program may not be authorized with the approval of a shoreline conditional use permit.

D.    A conditional use permit shall not be issued when uses are specifically prohibited by this Master Program. Nonclassified uses or uses not set forth in the Master Program may be authorized as a conditional use provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).

(Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.220.140 Revision to permits.

A.    A permit revision is required whenever the applicant proposes substantive changes to the design, terms or conditions of a project from those which are approved in the permit. Changes are substantive if they materially alter the project in a manner that relates to its conformance to the terms and conditions of the permit, this Master Program or the SMA. Changes that are not substantive in effect do not require a permit revision.

B.    An application for a revision to a shoreline permit shall be submitted to the Director. The application shall include detailed plans and text describing the proposed changes. The City shall review and process the request in accordance with the requirements of WAC 173-27-100, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.220.150 Nonconforming use and development.

A.    Nonconforming Structures.

1.    Structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use, but which are nonconforming with regard to setbacks, buffers or yards, area, bulk, height, or density, may be maintained and repaired, and may be enlarged or expanded; provided, that said enlargement does not increase the extent of nonconformity by further encroaching upon or extending into areas where construction or use would not be allowed for new development or uses. Such normal appurtenances are by definition located landward of the OHWM.

2.    A structure for which a shoreline variance has been issued shall be considered a legal nonconforming structure, and the requirements of this section shall apply as they apply to preexisting nonconformities.

3.    A structure that is being or has been utilized for a nonconforming use may be used for a different nonconforming use only upon the approval of a shoreline conditional use permit. A shoreline conditional use permit may be approved only upon a finding that:

a.    No reasonable alternative conforming use is practical;

b.    The proposed use will be at least as consistent with the policies and provisions of the SMA and this Master Program, and as compatible with the uses in the area, as the preexisting use; and

c.    Conditions may be attached to the permit as are deemed necessary to assure compliance with the above findings, the requirements of the Master Program and the SMA, and to ensure that the use will not become a nuisance or a hazard.

4.    Any structure nonconforming as to height or setback standards that becomes damaged may be repaired or reconstructed; provided, that:

a.    The extent of the previously existing nonconformance is not increased; and

b.    The building permit application for repair or reconstruction is submitted within 12 months of the occurrence of damage or destruction.

B.    Nonconforming Uses.

1.    Uses that were legally established and are nonconforming with regard to the use regulations of the Master Program may continue as legal nonconforming uses. Such uses shall not be enlarged or expanded, without an approved conditional use permit, except that nonconforming single-family residences that are located landward of the OHWM may be enlarged or expanded in conformance with applicable bulk and dimensional standards by the addition of space to the main structure or by the addition of normal appurtenances as defined in WAC 173-27-040(2)(g), as amended from time to time.

2.    A use which is listed as a conditional use but existed prior to adoption of the Master Program or any relevant amendment, and for which a conditional use permit has not been obtained, shall be considered a nonconforming use.

3.    A use which is listed as a conditional use in SMC Table 20.230.081 but existed prior to the applicability of the Master Program to the site, and for which a shoreline conditional use permit has not been obtained, shall be considered a nonconforming use.

4.    If a nonconforming use is abandoned for 12 consecutive months, or for 12 months during any two-year period, the nonconforming rights shall expire and any subsequent use shall be made conforming. A use authorized pursuant to subsection (B)(1) of this section shall be considered a conforming use for purposes of this section.

C.    Nonconforming Lots. An undeveloped lot, tract, parcel, site, or division of land located landward of the OHWM that was established in accordance with Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 7, and State subdivision requirements prior to the effective date of the SMA or the Master Program that does not conform to the present lot size standards may be developed if permitted by other land use regulations of the City, as long as such development conforms to all other requirements of this Master Program and the SMA. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.220.160 Enforcement.

A.    The Director is authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter and any rules and regulations promulgated hereunder pursuant to the enforcement and penalty provisions of Chapter 173-27 WAC, as amended from time to time.

B.    This program will be enforced by the means and procedures set forth in Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 9. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).

Subchapter 1.

General Policies and Regulations


20.230.010 General.

The general policies and regulations apply to all uses and activities that may occur within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction regardless of this Master Program’s environment designation. These policies and regulations provide the overall framework for the management of the shoreline. Use these general regulations in conjunction with Subchapter 2 of this chapter, Specific Shoreline Use Policies and Regulations. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.020 Environmental.

The SMA is concerned with the environmental impacts that development, use, or activity may have on the fragile shorelines of the State. Development and certain uses or activities within the regulated shoreline may degrade the shoreline and its waters, and may damage or inhibit important species and their habitat.

A.    General Environmental Policies and Regulations.

1.    Policies.

a.    The adverse impacts of shoreline developments and activities on the natural environment, critical areas and habitats for proposed, threatened, and endangered species should be minimized during all phases of development (e.g., design, construction, operation, and management).

b.    Shoreline developments that protect and/or contribute to the long-term restoration of habitat for proposed, threatened, and endangered species are consistent with the fundamental goals of this Master Program. Shoreline developments that propose to enhance critical areas, other natural characteristics, resources of the shoreline, and/or provide public access and recreational opportunities to the shoreline are also consistent with the fundamental goals of this Master Program, and should be encouraged.

2.    Regulations.

a.    All shoreline development and activity shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed in a manner that mitigates adverse impacts to the environment. When applying mitigation to avoid or minimize significant adverse effects and significant ecological impacts, the City will apply the following sequence of steps in order of priority, with subsection (A)(2)(a)(i) of this section being top priority:

i.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

ii.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

iii.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

iv.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations;

v.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments; or

vi.    Monitoring the impact and the compensation projects (from subsection (A)(2)(a)(v) of this section) and taking appropriate corrective measures.

b.    Efforts to avoid and minimize impacts must be documented in a manner acceptable to the Director prior to the approval of mitigation and/or compensation actions.

c.    All shoreline development and activity shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed in a manner that assures no net loss of shoreline ecological function.

d.    All shoreline development shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed to protect the functions and values of critical areas consistent with the SMP critical areas regulations contained in Chapter 20.240 SMC.

e.    All shoreline development shall be located and designed to avoid or minimize the need for shoreline stabilization measures and flood protection works, such as bulkheads, revetments, dikes, levees, or substantial site regrading and dredging. Where measures and works are demonstrated to be necessary, biostabilization techniques shall be the preferred design option unless demonstrated to be infeasible, or when other alternatives will have less impact on the shoreline environment.

f.    All shoreline development and activity shall be located, designed, constructed, operated, and managed to minimize interference with beneficial natural shoreline processes, such as water circulation, sand and gravel movement, erosion, and accretion to ensure no net loss of shoreline ecological function.

g.    In approving shoreline development, the Director shall ensure that the development will maintain, enhance, or restore desirable shoreline features, as well as ensure no net loss of ecological functions. To this end, the Director may adjust and/or prescribe project dimensions, location of project components on the site, intensity of use, screening, and mitigation as deemed appropriate. Mitigation shall be required of developments that would otherwise result in net loss of ecological functions.

h.    In approving shoreline development, the Director shall consider short- and long-term adverse environmental impacts. In addition, the Director shall consider the cumulative adverse impacts of the development, particularly the precedence effect of allowing one development, which could generate or attract additional development. Identified significant short-term, long-term, and cumulative adverse environmental impacts lacking appropriate mitigation shall be sufficient reason for permit denial.

i.    As a condition of approval, the Director may require periodic monitoring for up to 10 years from the date of completed development to ensure the success of required mitigation. Mitigation plans shall include at a minimum:

i.    Inventory of the existing shoreline environment including the physical, chemical, and biological elements, and provide an assessment of each element’s condition;

ii.    A discussion of the project’s impacts and their effect on the ecological functions necessary to support existing shoreline resources;

iii.    A discussion of any Federal, State, or local special management recommendations that have been developed for wetlands, species, or habitats located on the site;

iv.    An assessment of habitat recommendations proposed by resource agencies and their applicability to the proposal;

v.    A discussion of measures to preserve existing habitats and opportunities to restore habitats that were degraded prior to the proposed land use activity. Mitigation plans shall include at a minimum: planting and soil specifications (in the case of mitigation planting projects), success standards, and contingency plans;

vi.    A discussion of proposed measures that mitigate the impacts of the project and establish success criteria;

vii.    An evaluation of the anticipated effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures;

viii.    A discussion of proposed management practices that will protect fish and wildlife habitat after the project site has been fully developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs;

ix.    A monitoring plan, including scientific procedures to be used to establish success or failure of the project, sampling points, success criteria, and a monitoring schedule; and

x.    Any additional information necessary to determine the impacts of a proposal and appropriate mitigation.

j.    Shoreline development shall not be permitted if it substantially degrades the natural character of the shoreline, natural resources, or public recreational use of the shoreline. 

k    Where provisions of this Master Program conflict with each other, or with other laws, ordinances or programs, the most restrictive provisions shall apply.

B.    Earth.

1.    Policies.

a.    Beaches are valued for recreation and may provide fish spawning substrate. Development that could disrupt these shoreforms may be allowed:

i.    When such disruption would not reduce shoreline ecological function;

ii.    Where there is a demonstrated public benefit; and/or

iii.    Where the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) determines there would be no significant impact to the fisheries resource.

2.    Regulations.

a.    Developments that alter the shoreline topography may be approved if:

i.    Flood events will not increase in frequency or severity resulting from the alteration; and/or

ii.    The alteration would not impact natural habitat forming processes and would not reduce ecological functions. Mitigation is required for projects that would reduce ecological functions to ensure no net loss of function.

b.    The applicant shall incorporate all known, available, and reasonable methods of prevention, control, and treatment measures into stormwater pollution prevention during and post construction.

c.    All debris and other waste materials from construction shall be disposed of in such a manner as to prevent their entry into the water body.

d.    All disposal sites for soils and materials resulting from the shoreline development shall be identified and approved before permit issuance.

C.    Water.

1.    Policies.

a.    Shoreline development and activities shall result in no net loss of ecological functions.

b.    Development and regulated activities shall minimize impacts to hydrogeologic processes, surface water drainage, and ground water recharge.

c.    Measures shall be incorporated into the development, use, or activity to protect water bodies and wetlands from all sources of pollution including, but not limited to, sediment and silt, petrochemicals, and wastes and dredge spoils.

d.    Adequate provisions to prevent water runoff from contaminating surface and ground water shall be included in development design. The Director may specify the method of surface water control and maintenance programs. Surface water control must comply with the adopted stormwater manual.

e.    All measures for the treatment of surface water runoff for the purpose of maintaining and/or enhancing water quality shall be conducted on site. Off-site treatment facilities may be considered if on-site treatment is not feasible.

f.    Point and nonpoint source pollution should be managed on a basin-wide basis to protect water quality and support the efforts of shoreline property owners to maintain shoreline ecological functions.

2.    Regulations.

a.    Pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers that have been identified by State or Federal agencies as harmful to humans, wildlife, or fish shall not be used on City-owned property within the shoreline jurisdiction or for development or uses approved under a substantial development permit, shoreline conditional use permit, or shoreline variance, except as allowed by the Director for the following circumstances:

i.    When use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers is consistent with the best management practices (BMPs) for the project or use proposed;

ii.    When the Director determines that an emergency situation exists where there is a serious threat to public safety, health, or the environment and that an otherwise prohibited application must be used as a last resort;

iii.    Where chemical fertilizer, herbicide, or pesticide use is necessary to protect existing natural vegetation or establish new vegetation as part of an erosion control or mitigation plan, the use of time release fertilizer and herbicides shall be preferred over liquid or concentrate application, except as used in targeted hand applications.

b.    The release of oil, chemical, or hazardous materials onto or into the water is prohibited. Equipment for the transportation, storage, handling, or application of such materials shall be maintained in a safe and leakproof condition. If there is evidence of leakage, the further use of such equipment shall be suspended until the deficiency has been satisfactorily corrected. During construction, vehicle refueling and vehicle maintenance shall occur outside of regulated shoreline areas.

c.    The bulk storage of oil, fuel, chemical, or hazardous materials, on either a temporary or a permanent basis, is prohibited, except for uses allowed by the zoning classification. For the purpose of this section, heating oil, small boat fuel, yard maintenance equipment fuel, propane, sewage sumps, and similar items common to single-family residential uses are not included in this definition.

D.    Plants and Animals.

1.    Policies.

a.    In general, this Master Program shall strive to protect and restore anadromous fish resources in the Puget Sound and its tributaries within the City.

b.    Shoreline development, uses, and activities shall be:

i.    Located and conducted in a manner that minimizes impacts to existing ecological values and natural resources of the area, conserves properly functioning conditions, and ensures no net loss of shoreline ecological functions;

ii.    Scheduled to protect biological productivity and to minimize interference with fish resources including anadromous fish migration, spawning, and rearing activity;

iii.    Designed to avoid the removal of trees in shorelines wherever practicable, and to minimize the removal of other woody vegetation. Where riparian vegetation is removed, measures to mitigate the loss of vegetation shall be implemented to ensure no net loss; and

iv.    Designed to minimize impacts to the natural character of the shoreline as much as possible.

2.    Regulations.

a.    Mitigation shall be required of the applicant for the loss of fish and wildlife resources, and natural systems, including riparian vegetation, wetlands, and other environmentally critical areas. The mitigation required shall be commensurate to the value and type of resource or system impacted by development and activity in the shoreline. On-site compensatory mitigation shall be the preferred mitigation option, except where off-site mitigation can be demonstrated to be more beneficial to fish and wildlife resources, and natural systems, including riparian vegetation, wetlands, and critical areas. If on-site compensatory mitigation is not feasible or if off-site mitigation is demonstrated to be more beneficial to the shoreline environment, the applicant shall provide funding for a publicly sponsored restoration or enhancement program in the City.

b.    Enhancement, restoration, and/or creation of coniferous riparian forest or forested riparian wetland shall be the preferred mitigation for impacts to riparian vegetation and wetlands when avoidance is not possible. Preference will be based on site-specific recommendation of qualified professional. Alterations to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas should be avoided. If they cannot be avoided, mitigation is required, and a habitat management plan shall be prepared as required in SMC 20.240.274.

c.    Habitat management plans shall be forwarded by the applicant to the appropriate State and/or Federal resource agencies for review and comment. The City will provide the applicant with a list of addressees for this purpose.

d.    Based on the habitat management plan, and comments from other agencies, the Director may require mitigating measures to reduce the impacts of the proposal on the fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

i.    Increased or enhanced buffers;

ii.    Setbacks for permanent and temporary structures;

iii.    Reduced project scope;

iv.    Limitations on construction hours;

v.    Limitations on hours of operation; and/or

vi.    Relocation of access.

e.    Mitigation activities shall be monitored to determine effectiveness of the habitat mitigation plan. Monitoring shall be accomplished by a third party, subject to the approval by the Director, and shall have the concurrence of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA Fisheries, WDFW, and, where applicable, the Department of Ecology. Monitoring shall occur for up to 10 years following implementation of the plan. Results of the monitoring shall be publicly available and reported to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service. Reports shall contain the following information:

i.    A list and map of parcels subject to this requirement;

ii.    The implementation status of the habitat management plans;

iii.    Status of the improvements (e.g., updates if success standards are being met, what types of remedial actions have been implemented); and

iv.    Recommendations for corrective measures if necessary.

f.    If proposed mitigation is found to be inadequate, or if adequate mitigation is determined to be impossible, the application shall be denied.

g.    Timing of in-water construction, development, or activity shall be determined by WDFW.

h.    Properties that are located in the urban conservancy shoreline environment designation shall retain trees that are 12 inches or more in diameter. Trees determined by a certified arborist to be hazardous or diseased may be removed upon approval by the City. If healthy or nonhazardous trees are removed, each removed tree must be replaced with at least three six-foot-tall trees, one 18-foot-tall tree, or one 12-foot plus one six-foot-tall tree. Trees must be of the same species removed, or equivalent native tree species.

E.    Noise.

1.    Policy.

a.    Noise levels shall not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the shoreline.

2.    Regulations.

a.    Any noise emanating from a shoreline use or activity shall be muffled so as to not interfere with the designated use of adjoining properties. This determination shall take into consideration ambient noise levels, intermittent beat, frequency, and shrillness.

b.    Ambient noise levels shall be a factor in evaluating a shoreline permit application.

The applicant or project owner shall notify the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, affected Indian tribes, and the City.

c.    Where archaeological or historic sites have been identified, and it is determined that public access to the site will not damage or reduce the cultural value of the site, access may be required consistent with SMC 20.230.040. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.030 Environmentally sensitive areas within the shoreline.

Repealed by Ord. 856. (Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.040 Public access.

Public access to the shoreline is the physical ability of the general public to reach and touch the water’s edge and/or the ability to have a view of the water and the shoreline from upland locations. There are a variety of types of public access, such as picnic areas, pathways and trails, promenades, bridges, street ends, ingress and egress, and parking.

A.    Public Access Policies.

1.    Public access provisions should be incorporated into all private and public developments. Exceptions may be considered for the following types of uses:

a.    A single-family residence;

b.    An individual multifamily structure containing four or less dwelling units; and/or

c.    Where deemed inappropriate by the Director.

2.    Development uses and activities on or near the shoreline should not impair or detract from the public’s visual or physical access to the water.

3.    Public access to the shoreline should be sensitive to the unique characteristics of the shoreline and should preserve the natural character and quality of the environment and adjacent wetlands; public access should assure no net loss of ecological functions.

4.    Where appropriate, water-oriented public access should be provided as close as possible to the water’s edge without adversely affecting a sensitive environment.

5.    Except for access to the water, the preferred location for placement of public access trails is as close to the furthest landward edge of the native vegetation zone as practical. Public access facilities should provide auxiliary facilities, such as parking and sanitation, when appropriate, and shall be designed for accessibility by people with disabilities. Publicly owned shorelines should be limited to water-dependent or public recreation uses; otherwise such shorelines should remain protected open space.

6.    Public access afforded by public right-of-way street ends adjacent to the shoreline should be preserved, maintained, and enhanced.

7.    Public access should be designed to provide for public safety and to minimize potential impacts to private property and individual privacy. This may include providing a physical separation to reinforce the distinction between public and private space, providing adequate space, through screening with landscape planting or fences, or other means.

8.    Public views from the shoreline upland areas should be enhanced and preserved. Enhancement of views should not be construed to mean excess removal of vegetation that partially impairs views.

9.    Public access facilities should be constructed of environmentally friendly materials and support healthy natural processes, whenever financially feasible and possible.

10.    Public access facilities should be maintained to provide a clean, safe experience, and to protect the environment.

B.    Public Access Regulations.

1.    Public access shall be required for all shoreline development and uses, except for a single-family residence or residential projects containing four or less dwelling units.

2.    Requirement of public access to shorelines does not confer the right to enter upon or cross private property, except for dedicated and marked public easements.

3.    A shoreline development or use that does not provide public access may be authorized provided the applicant demonstrates and the Director determines that one or more of the following provisions apply:

a.    Unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public exist that cannot be prevented by any feasible means;

b.    Security requirements cannot be satisfied through the application of alternative design features or other solutions;

c.    The cost of providing the access, easement, or an alternative amenity is unreasonably disproportionate to the total long-term cost of the proposed development;

d.    Unacceptable environmental harm, such as damage to fish spawning areas, will result from the public access that cannot be mitigated; and/or

e.    Significant conflict between the proposed access and adjacent uses would occur and cannot be mitigated.

4.    The applicant must also demonstrate that all reasonable means to public access have been exhausted, including but not limited to:

a.    Regulating access by such means as limiting use to daylight hours;

b.    Designing separation of uses and activities with such means as fences, terracing, hedges, or landscaping; and/or

c.    Providing access that is physically separated from the proposal, such as a nearby street end, an off-site viewpoint, or a trail system.

5.    Public access sites shall be made barrier free for people with disabilities.

6.    Public access sites shall be connected directly to the nearest public street.

7.    Required public access sites shall be fully developed and available for public use at the time of occupancy or use of the development or activity.

8.    Public access easements and permit conditions shall be recorded on the deed where applicable or on the face of a plat or short plat as a condition running with the land. Said recording with the King County Recorder’s office shall occur at the time of permit approval.

9.    The standard Washington State approved logo and other approved signs that indicate the public’s right of access and hours of access shall be constructed, installed, and maintained by the applicant in conspicuous locations at public access sites. Signs controlling or restricting public access may be approved as a condition of permit approval.

10.    Development on or over the water shall be constructed as far landward as possible to avoid interference with views from surrounding properties to the shoreline and adjoining waters.

11.    Physical public access shall be designed to prevent significant impacts to natural systems by employing low impact development techniques. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).

Subchapter 2.

Specific Shoreline Use Policies and Regulations 


20.230.070 General.

Specific shoreline use provisions are more detailed than those listed in general policies and regulations. These use policies and regulations apply to the identified use categories and provide a greater level of detail for uses and their impacts. The policies establish the shoreline management principles that apply to each use category and serve as a bridge between the various elements listed in SMC 20.200.040 and the use regulations that follow.

This subchapter also includes those activities that modify the configuration or qualities of the shoreline area. Shoreline modification activities are, by definition, undertaken in support of or in preparation for a permitted shoreline use. Typically, shoreline modification activities relate to construction of a physical element such as a breakwater, dredged basins, landfilling, etc., but they can include other actions such as clearing, grading, application of chemicals, etc.

Shoreline modification policies and regulations are intended to prevent, reduce, and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of proposed shoreline modifications consistent with the goals of the SMA. A proposed development must meet all of the regulations for both applicable uses and activities as well as the general and environment designation regulations.

The following policies and regulations apply to specific types of development that may be proposed in the shoreline jurisdiction of the City. A proposal can consist of more than one type of development. In addition, all specific shoreline development must be consistent with the following shoreline environmental designations; the goals and objectives of Chapter 20.200 SMC; the general policies and regulations contained in Chapter 20.230 SMC, Subchapter 1; and the critical areas regulations contained in Chapter 20.240 SMC. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.080 Shoreline environmental designations.

Aquatic Environment (A). Encompasses all submerged lands from OHWM to the middle of Puget Sound. The purpose of this designation is to protect, restore, and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the OHWM. New over-water structures are allowed only for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration and must be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use.

Urban Conservancy Environment (UC). The purpose of this designation is to protect and restore relatively undeveloped or unaltered shorelines to maintain open space, floodplains, or habitat, while allowing a variety of compatible uses. This designation shall apply to shorelines that retain important ecological functions, even if partially altered. These shorelines are suitable for low intensity development, uses that are a combination of water-related or water-enjoyment uses, or uses that allow substantial numbers of people access to the shoreline. Any undesignated shorelines are automatically assigned an urban conservancy designation.

Shoreline Residential Environment (SR). The purpose of this designation is to accommodate residential development and accessory structures that are consistent with this Master Program. This designation shall apply to shorelines that do not meet the criteria for urban conservancy and that are characterized by single-family or multifamily residential development or are planned and platted for residential development.

Waterfront Residential Environment (WR). The purpose of this designation is to distinguish between residential portions of the coastline where natural and artificially-created features preclude building within the shoreline jurisdiction and the section along 27th Avenue NW where residential properties directly abut the Puget Sound.

Characteristics of 27th Avenue NW include:

	•		Only fully established residential property in the City directly abutting the Puget Sound;

	•		Substantial number of legally existing nonconforming lots and nonconforming structures;

	•		Exposure to high energy wind and wave action;

	•		Fully armored shoreline prior to December 4, 1969, and residences occupied prior to January 1, 1992; and

	•		Failure of an individual bulkhead would cause adverse effect on subject property as well as neighboring properties.

These unique circumstances and considerations warrant different regulations for 27th Avenue NW as compared to existing residential property that is cut off from the shoreline by bluffs and railroad tracks (UC and SR), and potential new residential properties in the Point Wells designations (PW and PWC).

Point Wells Urban Environment (PW). The purpose of this designation is to accommodate higher density uses while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions that have been degraded.

Point Wells Urban Conservancy Environment (PWC). The purpose of this designation is to distinguish between differing levels of potential and existing ecological function within the Point Wells environment, and regulate uses and public access requirements appropriately.

6    Signs required by regulatory agencies for navigational operation, safety and direction purposes allowed in aquatic environment per SMC 20.230.230(B)(1).

7    Limited to water-dependent, public access, or shoreline stabilization activities.

8    This includes replacement.

9    Refer to SMC 20.230.130 for conditions.

(Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019).


20.230.082 Native conservation area and building setbacks.

The term “native conservation area” (NVCA) applies to areas where the shoreline is not armored, such as the PWC environment designation, and Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. NVCAs should be maintained in a predominantly natural, undisturbed, undeveloped, and vegetated condition, except where necessary to accommodate appurtenances to a permitted water-dependent use. The term “building setback” applies in areas where the railroad or bulkheads prohibit natural sediment transfer. In those areas, it is necessary to maintain hard-armored conditions, but further encroachment or vegetative clearing is not permitted. The area is measured horizontally from the OHWM and the structure or use.

Table 20.230.082 Native Conservation Area/Building Setbacks 

	Shoreline Environmental Designation	Minimum Native Vegetation Conservation or Building Setback Area

	Urban Conservancy	150 feet or 50 feet from the top of a landslide hazard area, whichever is greater

	Shoreline Residential    	115 feet

	Waterfront Residential	20 feet

	Point Wells Urban	200 feet (restoration required as part of development)

	Point Wells Urban Conservancy    	200 feet

Bulk standards will be regulated by underlying zoning according to SMC Table 20.50.020(1). Zoning designation is R6 for UC, SR, and WR, and yet to be determined for PW and PWC.

(Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019).


20.230.090 Boating facilities.

Boating facilities serving two or more single-family dwelling units generally include boat launch ramps (public and private), wet and dry boat storage, and related sales and service for pleasure and commercial watercraft. For the purpose of this section, boat hoists, davits, lifts, and/or dry boat storage of private watercraft consistent with single-family residential properties are not included.

A.    Boating Facilities Policies.

1.    Boating facilities can have a significant impact on habitat. The impacts of boating facilities should be reviewed thoroughly before boating facilities are permitted in the shoreline jurisdiction.

2.    Public and community boating facilities may be allowed. Individual private facilities are prohibited.

3.    New nonresidential boating facilities may be allowed as a conditional use within the regulated shoreline. When allowed, such facilities should be designed to accommodate public access and enjoyment of the shoreline location. Depending on the scale of the facility, public access should include walkways, viewpoints, restroom facilities, and other recreational uses.

4.    Dry boat storage should not be considered a water-oriented use. Only boat hoists, boat launch ramps, and access routes associated with a dry boat storage facility should be considered a water-oriented use.

5.    Health, safety and welfare considerations must be addressed in application for development of boating facilities.

6.    Navigation rights must be protected in development of boating facilities.

7.    Extended moorage on waters of the State without a lease or permission is restricted and mitigation of impacts to navigation and access is required.

B.    Boating Facilities Regulations.

1.    Boating facilities may be permitted only if:

a.    It can be demonstrated that the facility will not adversely impact fish or wildlife habitat areas or associated wetlands; and

b.    Adequate mitigation measures ensure that there is no net loss of the functions or values of the shoreline and habitat as a result of the facility.

2.    Boating facilities shall not be permitted within the following marine shoreline habitats because of their scarcity, biological productivity and sensitivity unless no alternative location is feasible, the project would result in a net enhancement of shoreline ecological functions, and the proposal is otherwise consistent with this program:

a.    Critical saltwater habitats; and

b.    Marshes, estuaries and other wetlands.

3.    Preferred ramp designs, in order of priority, are:

a.    Open grid designs with minimum coverage of beach substrate;

b.    Seasonal ramps that can be removed and stored upland; and

c.    Structures with segmented pads and flexible connections that leave space for natural beach substrate and can adapt to changes in beach profile.

4.    Ramps shall be placed and maintained near flush with the foreshore slope.

5.    Boat launches shall be designed and constructed using methods/technology that have been recognized and approved by State and Federal resource agencies as the best currently available. Rail and track systems shall be preferred over concrete ramps or similar facilities.

6.    Launch access for nonmotorized watercraft shall use gravel or other permeable material. Removal of vegetation for launch access should be limited to eight feet in width.

7.    Before granting approval of a permit to allow a boat launch ramp, the proponent must satisfactorily demonstrate that:

a.    Adequate facilities for the efficient handling of sewage and litter will be provided;

b.    The boating facilities will be designed so that structures are aesthetically compatible with or enhance shoreline features and uses; and

c.    The boating facilities will be designed so that existing or potential public access along beaches is not blocked or made unsafe, and so that public use of the surface waters is not unduly impaired.

C.    Boat Launch Ramps.

1.    Boat launch ramps shall be located on stable shorelines where water depths are adequate to eliminate or minimize the need for channel maintenance activities.

2.    Boat launch ramps may be permitted on accretion shoreforms provided any necessary grading is not harmful to affected resources.

3.    Where boat ramps are permitted, parking and shuttle areas shall not be located on accretion shoreforms.

4.    Boat launch ramps may be permitted on stable, noneroding banks where the need for shore stabilization structures is minimized.

5.    Ramp structures shall be placed near flush with the foreshore slope to minimize the interruption of geohydraulic processes.

6.    Boat launch sites that are open to the public shall have adequate restroom facilities operated and maintained in compliance with King County Health District regulations.

D.    Dry Boat Storage.

1.    Dry boat storage shall not be considered a water-oriented use and must comply with the required shoreline environment setback.

2.    Only water-dependent aspects of dry boat storage, such as boat hoists and boat launch ramps, may be permitted within shoreline environment setbacks.

3.    Boat launch ramps associated with dry boat storage shall be consistent with applicable requirements in this section. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.095 Breakwaters, jetties, groins, and weirs.

A.    Breakwaters, Jetties, Groins and Weirs Policies.

1.    Breakwaters, jetties, groins, and weirs should be permitted only for water-dependent uses and only where mitigated to provide no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and processes.

B.    Breakwaters, Jetties, Groins and Weirs Regulations.

1.    Groins are prohibited except as a component of a professionally designed public beach management program that encompasses an entire drift sector or reach for which alternatives are infeasible, or where installed to protect or restore shoreline ecological functions or processes.

2.    Jetties and breakwaters are prohibited except as an integral component of a professionally designed harbor or port. Where permitted, floating, portable or submerged breakwater structures, or smaller discontinuous structures, are preferred where physical conditions make such alternatives with less impact feasible. Defense works that substantially reduce or block littoral drift and cause erosion of downdrift shores shall not be allowed unless an adequate long-term professionally engineered beach nourishment program is established and maintained. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.100 Nonresidential development.

A.    Nonresidential Development Policies.

1.    Priority of any nonresidential development should be given to water-dependent and water- enjoyment uses. Allowed uses include restaurants that provide a view of the sound to customers, motels and hotels that provide walking areas for the public along the shoreline, office buildings, and retail sales buildings that have a waterfront theme with public access to the beach or water views.

2.    Over-the-water nonresidential development shall be prohibited.

3.    Nonresidential development should be required to provide on-site physical or visual access to the shoreline, or offer other opportunities for the public to enjoy shorelines of statewide significance. If on-site access cannot be provided, off-site access should be required. Off-site access could be procured through the purchase of land or an easement at a location appropriate to provide the access deemed necessary. Nonresidential developments should include multiple-use concepts such as open space and recreation.

4.    Nonresidential development in the shoreline jurisdiction should include landscaping to enhance the shoreline area.

B.    Nonresidential Development Regulations.

1.    Over-water construction of nonresidential uses is prohibited, with the exception of boat facilities necessary for the operation of an associated nonresidential use.

2.    All nonresidential development within the shoreline area shall provide for visual and/or physical access to the shoreline by the public. Where on-site public access is feasible, nonresidential development shall dedicate, improve, and provide maintenance for a pedestrian easement that provides area sufficient to ensure usable access to and along the shoreline for the general public. Public access easements shall be a minimum of 25 feet in width and shall comply with the public access standards contained in the “Public Access” section of this Master Program and this title.

3.    All nonresidential loading and service areas shall be located on the upland side of the nonresidential activity or provisions shall screen the loading and service areas from the shoreline.

4.    All nonresidential development within shoreline jurisdiction shall assure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

5.    A shoreline setback is not required to be maintained for water-dependent nonresidential development.

6.    Water-dependent, nonresidential development shall maintain a shoreline setback of either 25 feet from the OHWM or 10 feet from the edge of the base flood elevation, whichever is greater. If public access is provided to the shoreline, the setback may be reduced to 10 feet from the OHWM or the edge of the base flood elevation, whichever is greater.

7.    Non-water-dependent nonresidential development shall maintain a minimum setback from the OHWM consistent with Table 20.230.082. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.110 In-stream structures.

A.    In-Stream Structures Policies.

1.    In-stream structures should provide for the protection and preservation of ecosystem-wide processes, ecological functions, and cultural resources including, but not limited to, fish and fish passage, wildlife and water resources, shoreline critical areas, hydrogeological processes, and natural scenic vistas. The location and planning of in-stream structures should give due consideration to the full range of public interests, watershed functions and processes, and environmental concerns, with special emphasis on protecting and restoring priority habitats and species.

2.    Nonstructural and nonregulatory methods to protect, enhance, and restore shoreline ecological functions and processes and other shoreline resources should be encouraged as an alternative to structural in-stream structures.

B.    In-Stream Structures Regulations.

1.    Natural in-stream features such as snags, uprooted trees, or stumps should be left in place unless it can be demonstrated that they are actually causing bank erosion or higher flood stages.

2.    In-stream structures shall allow for normal ground water movement and surface runoff.

3.    In-stream structures shall not impede upstream or downstream migration of anadromous fish.

4.    All debris, overburden, and other waste materials from construction shall be disposed of in such a manner that prevents their entry into a water body. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.115 Aquaculture.

A.    Aquaculture Policies.

1.    Potential locations for aquaculture are relatively restricted due to specific requirements for water quality, temperature, flows, oxygen content, adjacent land uses, wind protection, commercial navigation, and, in marine waters, salinity. The technology associated with some forms of present-day aquaculture is still in its formative stages and experimental. Therefore, the City recognizes the necessity for some latitude in the development of this use as well as its potential impact on existing uses and natural systems.

2.    Aquaculture should not be permitted in areas where it would result in a net loss of ecological functions, adversely impact eelgrass and macroalgae, or significantly conflict with navigation and other water-dependent uses. Aquacultural facilities should be designed and located so as not to spread disease to native aquatic life, establish new nonnative species which cause significant ecological impacts, or significantly impact the aesthetic qualities of the shoreline. Impacts to ecological functions shall be mitigated according to the mitigation sequence described in SMC 20.230.020.

B.    Aquaculture Regulations.

1.    Aquaculture is allowed as a conditional use in the aquatic environment where it can be located, designed, constructed, and managed to avoid a net loss of ecological functions, not spread diseases to native aquatic life, not adversely impact native eelgrasses and macroalgae species, or not significantly conflict with navigation.

2.    The supporting infrastructure for aquaculture may be located landward of the aquaculture operation subject to this title.

3.    Aquaculture facilities are required to develop best management practices to minimize impacts from the construction and management of the facilities.

4.    New aquatic species that are not previously cultivated in Washington State shall not be introduced into Shoreline’s saltwaters or freshwaters without prior written approval of the Director of WDFW and the Director of the Washington Department of Health. This prohibition does not apply to: Pacific, Olympia, Kumomoto, Belon, or Virginica oysters; Manila, Butter, or Littleneck clams; or Geoduck clams.

5.    No aquacultural processing, except for the sorting or culling of the cultured organism and the washing or removal of surface materials or organisms, shall be permitted waterward of the OHWM unless fully contained within a tending boat or barge.

6.    Aquaculture wastes shall be disposed of in a manner that will ensure compliance with all applicable governmental waste disposal standards, including but not limited to the Federal Clean Water Act, Section 401, and Chapter 90.48 RCW, Water Pollution Control, as amended from time to time. No garbage, wastes, or debris shall be allowed to accumulate at the site of any aquaculture operation. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.120 Parking areas.

Subchapter 3.

Shoreline Modification Policies and Regulations 


20.230.150 General.

Shoreline modification involves developments that provide bank stabilization or flood control. The purpose of the modification is to reduce adverse impacts caused by natural processes, such as current, flood, tides, wind, or wave action. Shoreline modification includes all structural and nonstructural means to reduce flooding and/or erosion of banks.

Nonstructural methods include setbacks of permanent and temporary structures, relocation of the structure to be protected, ground water management, planning, bioengineering or “soft” engineered solutions, and regulatory measures to avoid the need for structural stabilization.

“Hard” structural stabilization measures refer to those with solid, hard surfaces, such as concrete bulkheads, while “soft” structural measures rely on natural materials such as biotechnical vegetation or beach enhancement. Generally, the harder the construction measure, the greater the impact on shoreline processes, including sediment transport, geomorphology, and biological functions. New structural shoreline stabilization also often results in vegetation removal, as well as damage to nearshore habitat and shoreline corridors. There are a range of measures varying from soft to hard that include:

	•		Vegetation enhancement;

	•		Upland drainage control;

	•		Biotechnical measures;

	•		Beach enhancement;

	•		Anchor trees;

	•		Gravel placement;

	•		Rock revetments;

	•		Gabions;

	•		Concrete groins;

	•		Retaining walls and bluff walls; and/or

	•		Bulkheads.

A.    Shoreline Modification Policies – General.

1.    Biostabilization and other bank stabilization measures should be located, designed, and constructed primarily to prevent damage to the existing primary structure.

2.    All new development should be located and designed to prevent or minimize the need for shoreline stabilization measures and flood protection works. New development requiring shoreline stabilization shall be discouraged in areas where no preexisting shoreline stabilization is present.

3.    Shoreline modifications are only allowed for mitigation or enhancement purposes, or when and where there is a demonstrated necessity to support or protect an existing primary structure or legally existing shoreline use that is otherwise in danger of loss or substantial damage.

4.    Proposals for shoreline modifications should be designed to protect life and property without impacting shoreline resources.

5.    Shoreline modifications that are natural in appearance, compatible with ongoing shoreline processes, and provide flexibility for long-term management, such as protective berms or vegetative stabilization, should be encouraged over structural means such as concrete bulkheads or extensive revetments, where feasible.

6.    Structural solutions to reduce shoreline damage should be allowed only after it is demonstrated that nonstructural solutions would not be able to withstand the erosive forces of the current and waves.

7.    The design of bank stabilization or protection works should provide for the long-term, multiple use of shoreline resources and public access to public shorelines.

8.    In the design of publicly financed or subsidized works, consideration should be given to providing pedestrian access to shorelines for low impact outdoor recreation.

9.    All flood protection measures should be placed landward of the natural flood boundary, including wetlands that are directly interrelated and interdependent with water bodies.

10.    If, through construction and/or maintenance of shoreline modification developments, the loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat will occur, mitigation should be required.

11.    Existing, previously permitted stabilization measures, such as bulkheads and retaining walls, are considered engineered and abated hazards and shall not be classified as geologic hazard areas.

B.    Shoreline Modification Regulations – General.

1.    All new development, uses or activities within the shoreline area shall be located and designed to prevent or minimize the need for bank stabilization and flood protection works.

2.    Permitted and shoreline conditional use requirements for bulkheads and revetments are specified in this chapter. All other forms of shoreline modification, except soft shore, must be approved as a shoreline conditional use within all shoreline environments.

3.    All shoreline stabilization proposals require a geotechnical analysis.

4.    All shoreline development and activity shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed in a manner that mitigates impacts to the environment. The preferred mitigation sequence (avoid, minimize, mitigate, compensate) shall follow that listed in SMC 20.230.020(A).

5.    New non-water-dependent development, including single-family residences, that includes structural shoreline stabilization shall not be allowed unless all of the conditions below apply; otherwise new stabilization measures are limited to protecting only existing developments:

a.    The need to protect the development from destruction due to erosion caused by natural processes, such as currents and waves, is demonstrated through a geotechnical/hydrogeological report prepared by a City-approved qualified professional.

b.    The erosion is not caused by upland conditions, such as the loss of vegetation and/or drainage issues.

c.    There will be no net loss of shoreline ecological functions or impacts to adjacent or down-current properties.

d.    Nonstructural measures, such as placing the development further from the shoreline, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements and soft structural solutions such as bioengineering, are not feasible or not sufficient.

e.    The structure will not cause adverse impacts to the functions and values of critical areas or properly functioning conditions for proposed, threatened, and endangered species.

f.    Other mitigation/restoration measures are included in the proposal.

6.    Upon project completion, all disturbed shoreline areas shall be restored to as near pre-project configuration as possible and replanted with appropriate vegetation. All losses in riparian vegetation or wildlife habitat shall be mitigated at a ratio of 1:1.25 (habitat lost to habitat replaced).

7.    Shoreline stabilization and flood protection works are prohibited in wetlands and on point and channel bars. They are also prohibited in fish spawning areas.

8.    Developments shall not reduce the volume and storage capacity of streams and adjacent wetlands or flood plains.

9.    Use of refuse for the stabilization of shorelines is prohibited. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.160 Dredging and disposal of dredging spoils.

A.    Dredging and Dredge Spoil Policies.

1.    Dredging waterward of the OHWM for the primary purpose of obtaining fill material is prohibited.

2.    Proposals for dredging and dredge spoil disposal shall include all feasible mitigating measures to protect habitats and to minimize adverse impacts such as turbidity; release of nutrients, heavy metals, sulfides, organic materials, or toxic substances; depletion of oxygen; disruption of food chains; loss of benthic productivity; and disturbance of fish runs and/or important localized biological communities.

3.    Dredging and dredge spoil disposal shall not occur in wetlands unless for approved maintenance or enhancement associated with a restoration project.

4.    Dredging within the shorelines shall be permitted only:

a.    For navigational purposes; or

b.    For activities associated with shoreline or aquatic restoration or remediation.

5.    When dredging is permitted, the dredging shall be the minimum necessary to accommodate the proposed use.

6.    Dredging shall utilize techniques that cause minimum dispersal and broadcast of bottom material; hydraulic dredging shall be used wherever feasible in preference to agitation dredging.

7.    Dredge material disposal shall be permitted in shoreline jurisdiction only as part of an approved shoreline habitat and natural systems enhancement, fish habitat enhancement or watershed restoration project.

8.    Dredged spoil material may be disposed at approved upland sites. If these upland sites are dry lands and fall within shoreline jurisdiction, the disposal of dredge spoils shall be considered landfilling and must be consistent with all applicable provisions of this Master Program. Depositing dredge spoils within the Puget Sound shall be allowed only by shoreline conditional use for one of the following reasons:

a.    For wildlife habitat improvements; or

b.    To correct problems of material distribution that are adversely affecting fish resources.

9.    If suitable alternatives for land disposal are not available or are infeasible, water disposal sites may be permitted by appropriate agencies, provided the sites are determined by the Director to be consistent with the following criteria:

a.    Disposal will not interfere with geohydraulic processes;

b.    The dredge spoil has been analyzed by a qualified professional and found to be minimally or nonpolluting;

c.    Aquatic life will not be adversely affected; and

d.    The site and method of disposal meet all requirements of applicable regulatory agencies.

10.    Disposal of dredge material shall be done in accordance with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Dredge Material Management Program. DNR manages disposal sites through a site use authorization (SUA); all other required permits must be provided to DNR prior to the DNR issuing a SUA for dredge disposal.

11.    The City may impose reasonable limitations on dredge spoil disposal operating periods and hours, and may require buffer strips at land disposal sites. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.170 Piers and docks.

Piers and docks may be allowed in accordance with Table 20.230.081 only when the following conditions are met:

A.    The public’s need for piers and docks is clearly demonstrated, and the proposal is consistent with protection of the public trust, as embodied in RCW 90.58.020, as amended from time to time.

B.    Avoidance of impacts to critical saltwater habitats by an alternative alignment or location is not feasible, or would result in unreasonable and disproportionate cost to accomplish the same general purpose.

20.230.180 Bulkheads.

Bulkheads are walls usually constructed parallel to the shore, whose primary purpose is to contain and prevent the loss of soil by erosion, wave, or current action. Bulkheads are typically constructed of poured-in-place concrete; steel or aluminum sheet piling; wood; or wood and structural steel combinations.

The SMA only exempts the construction of a normal protective bulkhead associated with an existing single-family residence from the shoreline substantial development permit requirement. However, these structures are required to comply with all the policies and development standards of this Master Program.

A.    Bulkhead Policies.

1.    Bulkheads constructed from natural materials, such as protective berms, beach enhancement, or vegetative stabilization, are strongly preferred over structural bulkheads constructed from materials such as steel, wood, or concrete. Proposals for bulkheads should demonstrate that natural methods are unworkable.

2.    Bulkheads should be located, designed, and constructed primarily to prevent damage to the existing primary structure. New development that requires bulkheads is not permitted except as specifically provided under this Master Program.

3.    Shoreline uses should be located in a manner so that a bulkhead is not likely to become necessary in the future.

4.    Bulkheads should not be approved as a solution to geophysical problems such as mass slope failure, sloughing, or landslides. Bulkheads should only be approved for the purposes of preventing bank erosion by the Puget Sound.

B.    Bulkhead Regulations.

1.    New bulkheads may be allowed only when evidence is presented to demonstrate that one of the following conditions exists:

a.    Serious erosion threatens an established use or existing primary structure on upland property;

b.    Bulkheads are necessary to the operation and location of water-dependent, water-related, or water-enjoyment activities consistent with this Master Program; provided, that all other alternative methods of shore protection have proven infeasible; and/or

c.    A bulkhead is necessary to retain landfilling that has been approved consistent with the provisions of this Master Program.

2.    Proposals for bulkheads must first demonstrate through a geotechnical analysis that use of natural materials and processes and nonstructural or soft structural solutions to bank stabilization are not feasible.

3.    The construction of a bulkhead for the primary purpose of retaining landfilling shall be allowed only in conjunction with:

a.    A water-dependent use;

b.    A bridge or navigational structure for which there is a demonstrated public need and where no feasible upland sites, design solutions, or routes exist; and/or

c.    A wildlife or fish enhancement project.

4.    Bulkheads shall not be located on shorelines where valuable geohydraulic or biological processes are sensitive to interference. Examples of such areas include wetlands and accretion landforms.

5.    Bulkheads are to be permitted only where local physical conditions, such as foundation bearing materials, and surface and subsurface drainage, are suitable for such alterations.

6.    If possible, bulkheads shall be located landward of the OHWM and generally parallel to the natural shoreline. In addition:

a.    Where no other bulkheads are adjacent, the construction of a bulkhead shall be as close to the eroding bank as possible and in no case shall it be more than three feet from the toe of the bank;

b.    A bulkhead for permitted landfilling shall be located at the toe of the fill; and

c.    Where permitted, a bulkhead must tie in flush with existing bulkheads on adjoining properties; except where the adjoining bulkheads extend waterward of the base flood elevation, the requirements set forth in this section shall apply.

7.    Replacement bulkheads may be located immediately waterward of the bulkhead to be replaced such that the two bulkheads will share a common surface, except where the existing bulkhead has not been backfilled or has been abandoned and is in serious disrepair. In such cases, the replacement bulkhead shall not encroach waterward of the OHWM or existing structure unless the residence was occupied prior to January 1, 1992, and there are overriding safety or environmental concerns.

8.    All bulkhead proposals require a geotechnical report prepared by a qualified professional. Bulkheads shall be sited and designed as recommended in approved geotechnical reports. For the waterfront residential environment designation, one geotechnical report could be prepared for multiple properties.

9.    When a bulkhead is required at a public access site, provision for safe access to the water shall be incorporated into bulkhead design.

10.    Bulkheads shall be designed for the minimum dimensions necessary to adequately protect the development.

11.    Stairs or other permitted structures may be built into a bulkhead but shall not extend waterward of the bulkhead, unless they are retractable or removable.

12.    Bulkheads shall be designed to permit the passage of surface or ground water without causing ponding or saturation of retained soil/materials.

13.    Adequate toe protection consisting of proper footings, a fine retention mesh, etc., shall be provided to ensure bulkhead stability without relying on additional riprap.

14.    Materials used in bulkhead construction shall meet the following standards:

a.    Bulkheads shall utilize stable, nonerodible, homogeneous materials such as concrete, wood, and rock that are consistent with the preservation and protection of the ecological habitat;

b.    Dredge spoils shall not be used for fill behind bulkheads, except clean dredge spoil from a permitted off-site dredge and fill operation; and

c.    Backfill and wave returns to stabilize bulkheads are permitted. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.190 Revetment.

A revetment is a sloped shoreline structure built to protect an existing eroding shoreline or newly placed fill against currents. Revetments are most commonly built of randomly placed boulders (riprap) but may also be built of sand cement bags, paving or building blocks, gabions (rock filled wire baskets), or other systems and materials. The principal features of a revetment, regardless of type, are a heavy armor layer, a filter layer, and toe protection.

A.    Revetment Policies.

1.    The use of armored structural revetments should be limited to situations where it is determined that nonstructural solutions such as bioengineering, setbacks, buffers or any combination thereof, will not provide sufficient shoreline stabilization.

2.    Revetments should be designed, improved, and maintained to provide public access whenever possible.

B.    Revetment Regulation.

1.    The proposed revetment shall be designed by a qualified professional engineer.

2.    Design of revetments shall include and provide improved access to public shorelines whenever possible.

3.    When permitted, the location and design of revetments shall be determined using engineering principles, including guidelines of the Natural Resources Conservation Service and USACE.

4.    Armored revetment design shall meet the following design criteria:

a.    The size and quantity of the material shall be limited to only that necessary to withstand the estimated energy intensity of the hydraulic system;

b.    Filter fabric must be used to aid drainage and help prevent settling;

c.    The toe reinforcement or protection must be adequate to prevent a collapse of the system from scouring or wave action; and

d.    Fish habitat components, such as large boulders, logs, and stumps, shall be considered in the design subject to a hydraulic project approval by WDFW. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.200 Land disturbing activities.

A.    Land Disturbing Activity Policies.

1.    Land disturbing activities should only be allowed in association with a permitted shoreline development.

2.    Land disturbing activities should be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate the shoreline development or a landscape plan developed in conjunction with the shoreline development.

3.    Erosion shall be prevented and sediment shall not enter waters of the State.

B.    Land Disturbing Activity Regulations.

1.    All land disturbing activities shall only be allowed in association with a permitted shoreline development.

2.    All land disturbing activities shall be limited to the minimum necessary for the intended development, including any clearing and grading approved as part of a landscape plan. Clearing invasive, nonnative shoreline vegetation listed on the King County Noxious Weed List is permitted in the shoreline area with an approved clearing and grading permit provided best management practices are used as recommended by a qualified professional, and native vegetation is promptly reestablished in the disturbed area.

3.    Tree and vegetation removal shall be prohibited in required native vegetation conservation areas, except as necessary to restore, mitigate or enhance the native vegetation by approved permit as required in these areas.

4.    All significant trees in the native vegetation conservation areas shall be designated as protected trees consistent with SMC 20.50.330 and removal of hazard trees must be consistent with SMC 20.50.310(A)(1).

5.    All shoreline development and activities shall use measures identified in the 2014 Department of Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, or as revised. Stabilization of exposed surfaces subject to erosion along shorelines shall, whenever feasible, utilize soil bioengineering techniques.

6.    For extensive land disturbing activities that require a permit, a plan addressing species removal, revegetation, irrigation, erosion and sedimentation control, and other methods of shoreline protection should be required. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 850 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 668 § 4 (Exh. 3), 2013).


20.230.210 Landfilling.

A.    Landfilling Policies.

1.    The perimeter of landfilling should be designed to avoid or eliminate erosion and sedimentation impacts, during both initial landfilling activities and over time.

2.    Where permitted, landfilling should be the minimum necessary to provide for the proposed use and should be permitted only when conducted in conjunction with a specific development proposal that is permitted by this Master Program. Speculative landfilling activity should be prohibited.

B.    Landfilling Regulations.

1.    Landfilling activities shall only be permitted in conjunction with a specific development. Landfilling may be permitted as a shoreline conditional use for any of the following:

a.    In conjunction with a water-dependent use permitted under this Master Program; and/or

b.    In conjunction with a bridge, utility, or navigational structure for which there is a demonstrated public need and where no feasible upland sites, design solutions, or routes exist.

2.    Pier or pile supports shall be utilized in preference to landfilling. Landfilling for approved road development in floodways or wetlands shall be permitted only if pile or pier supports are proven structurally infeasible.

Subchapter 1.

Critical Areas – General Provisions


20.240.010 Purpose.

A.    The purpose of this chapter is to establish supplemental standards for the protection of critical areas and their associated buffers within the shoreline jurisdiction consistent with the goals and policies of the SMA.

B.    The provisions of this chapter do not extend beyond the shoreline jurisdiction limits specified in this Master Program and the SMA.

C.    By identifying and regulating development and alterations to critical areas and buffers within the shoreline jurisdiction it is the intent of this chapter to:

1.    Protect the public from injury, loss of life, property damage or financial losses due to flooding, erosion, landslide, seismic events, or soils subsidence;

2.    Protect unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment;

3.    Reduce cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands, streams, and other aquatic resources; fish and wildlife habitat; landslide hazards; and other geologically unstable features and protect the functions and values of critical areas from overall net loss;

4.    Ensure the long-term protection of ground and surface water quality;

5.    Alert members of the public, including appraisers, assessors, owners, potential buyers, or lessees, to the development limitations of critical areas and their required buffers;

6.    Serve as a basis for exercise of the City’s substantive authority under SEPA, and the City’s environmental procedures (Chapter 20.30 SMC, Subchapter 8);

7.    To comply with the requirements of the SMA and its implementing regulations;

8.    Establish standards and procedures that are intended to protect critical areas and their associated buffers within the shoreline jurisdiction while accommodating the rights of property owners to use their property in a reasonable manner; and

9.    Provide for the management of critical areas and buffers within the shoreline jurisdiction so as not to result in a net loss of ecological functions and to restore degraded ecosystems.

D.    This chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics.

E.    For the purpose of this chapter, critical areas and buffers shall have the same meanings as set forth in Chapter 20.20 SMC and RCW 36.70A.030(5), as amended from time to time.

F.    For the purpose of this chapter, when referring to “functions and values” or “functions,” it is the critical area’s functions and values in relationship to the shoreline ecological functions. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.015 Applicability.

A.    Unless explicitly exempted, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all land uses, development activity, and all structures and facilities within critical areas and buffers located within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction, whether or not a permit or authorization is required, and shall apply to every person or entity that owns, leases, or administers land within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction.

B.    No person or entity shall alter a critical area or buffer in the shoreline jurisdiction except in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

C.    The City shall not approve any permit or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation or to construct or alter any structure or improvement in the shoreline jurisdiction without first assuring compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

D.    Approval of a permit or development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

E.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any forest practices over which the City has jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 76.09 RCW and WAC Title 222, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.020 Relationship to other regulations.

A.    These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay in addition to use and development regulations established by the City consistent with the SMA and this Master Program. In the event of any conflict between these regulations and any other regulations of the City, the regulations that provide greater protection to the critical areas shall apply.

B.    Areas characterized by particular critical areas may also be subject to other regulations established by this chapter due to the overlap or multiple functions of some critical areas. In the event of any conflict between regulations for particular critical areas in this chapter, the regulations that provide greater protection to critical areas shall apply.

C.    These critical areas regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under SEPA, as necessary and locally adopted. Any conditions required pursuant to this chapter shall be included in the SEPA review and threshold determination.

D.    Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with other Federal, State, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, shoreline substantial development permits, Hydraulic Permit Act (HPA) permits, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, USACE Section 404 permits, or National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this chapter. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.025 Critical areas maps.

A.    The approximate location and extent of identified critical areas within the City’s planning area are shown on the critical areas maps adopted as part of this chapter, including but not limited to the maps identified in SMC 20.240.222, 20.240.272, and 20.240.322. These maps shall be used for informational purposes as a general guide only for the assistance of property owners and other interested parties. Boundaries and locations indicated on the maps are generalized. Critical areas and their buffers may occur within the shoreline jurisdiction that have not previously been mapped. A site inspection by staff or an applicant’s critical area worksheet may also indicate the presence of a critical area.

B.    Based on an indicated critical area in subsection A of this section, the actual presence or absence of, and delineation and classification of, critical areas shall be identified in the field by a qualified professional, and confirmed by the City, according to the procedures, definitions and criteria established by SMC 20.240.080(D)(1) and (2). In the event of any conflict between the critical area location or designation shown on the City’s maps and the criteria or standards of this chapter, the criteria and standards of this chapter shall prevail.

C.    The critical areas maps shall be periodically updated by the City and shall reflect any permit activity, results of special studies and reports reviewed and approved by the City, amendments to the Comprehensive Plan Natural Environment Element, and Department-identified errors and corrections. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.040 Allowed activities.

A.    Critical Area Report. Activities allowed under this section shall have been reviewed and permitted or approved by the City and any other agency with jurisdiction, but do not require submittal of a separate critical area report, unless such submittal was required previously for the underlying permit. The Director may apply conditions to the underlying permit or approval to ensure that the allowed activity is consistent with the provisions of this chapter to protect critical areas.

B.    Best Management Practices. All allowed activities shall be conducted using the best management practices that result in the least amount of impact to the critical areas. Best management practices shall be used for tree and vegetation protection, construction management, erosion and sedimentation control, water quality protection, and regulation of chemical applications. The City shall require the use of best management practices to ensure that the activity does not result in degradation to the critical area. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense.

C.    Allowed Activities. The following activities are allowed:

1.    Modifications to Existing Structures within Critical Areas. Structural modification of, addition to, maintenance, repair, or replacement of legally nonconforming structures consistent with SMC 20.220.150, which do not meet the building setback or buffer requirements for wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, or geologic hazard areas if the modification, addition, replacement, or related activity does not increase the existing building footprint of the structure or area of hardscape lying within the critical area or buffer. Within landslide hazard areas, additions that add height to a nonconforming structure may only be allowed with review of a critical area report demonstrating that no increased risk of the hazard will occur. If such modification, alteration, repair, or replacement requires temporary or construction related encroachment into a critical area or a critical area buffer to perform the work, then encroachment may be allowed subject to restoration of the area of encroachment to a same or better condition.

2.    Demolition. Demolition of structures located within critical areas or their buffers, excluding demolition of structures necessary to support or stabilize landslide hazard areas, and subject to approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the adopted stormwater manual and clearing limits that will adequately protect the critical area.

3.    Permit Requests Subsequent to Previous Critical Area Review. A permit or approval sought as part of a development proposal for which multiple permits are required is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, except for the notice to title provisions, as applicable if:

a.    The City has previously reviewed all critical areas on the site; and

b.    There is no material change in the development proposal since the prior review; and

c.    There is no new information available that may alter previous critical area review of the site or a particular critical area; and

d.    The permit or approval under which the prior review was conducted has not expired or, if no expiration date, no more than five years have lapsed since the issuance of that permit or approval; and

e.    The prior permit or approval, including any conditions, has been complied with. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.045 Critical areas preapplication meeting.

A.    A preapplication meeting, pursuant to SMC 20.30.080, is required prior to submitting an application for development or use of land that may impact critical areas or buffers within the shoreline jurisdiction.

B.    A determination may be provided through the preapplication meeting regarding whether critical area reports are required, and if so what level of detail and what elements may be necessary for the proposed project. An applicant may submit a critical area delineation and classification study prior to the City determining that a full critical area report is required.

This determination does not preclude the Director from requiring additional critical area report information during the review of the project. After a site visit and review of available information for the preapplication meeting, the Director may determine:

1.    No Critical Areas Present. If the Director’s analysis indicates that the project area is not within or adjacent to a critical area or buffer and that the proposed activity is unlikely to result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions provided by the critical area or buffer, then the Director shall determine that the critical area review is complete and note in the preapplication meeting summary letter the reasons that no further review is required.

2.    Critical Areas Present, but No Impact. If the Director determines that there are critical areas within or adjacent to the project area, but that the best available science shows that the proposed activity is unlikely to result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions provided by the critical area or buffer, the Director may waive the requirement for a critical area report. A waiver may be granted if there is substantial evidence that all of the following requirements will be met:

a.    There will be no alteration of the critical area or buffer;

b.    The development proposal will not impact the critical area in a manner contrary to the purpose, intent, and requirements of this chapter, this Master Program, and the SMA; and

c.    The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

A summary of this analysis and the findings shall be included in the preapplication meeting summary letter and any staff report or decision on the underlying permit.

3.    Critical Areas May Be Affected by Proposal. If the Director determines that a critical area(s) or buffer(s) may be affected by the proposal, then the Director shall notify the applicant that a critical area report(s) shall be submitted prior to further review of the project, and indicate each of the critical area types that should be addressed in the report. Additionally, the Director may indicate the sections or report types that shall be included in the critical report(s) consistent with SMC 20.240.080. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.050 Alteration of critical areas.

In general, critical areas and buffers shall be maintained in their existing state including undisturbed, native vegetation to maintain the functions, values, resources, and public health and safety for which the critical areas and buffers are protected or allowed as the current, developed, legally established condition such as graded areas, structures, pavement, gardens, and lawns. Alteration of critical areas, including their established buffers, may only be permitted subject to the criteria and standards in this chapter, and compliance with any Federal and/or State permits required. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, if alteration of the critical area is unavoidable, all adverse impacts to or from critical areas and buffers resulting from a development proposal or alteration shall be mitigated using the best available science in accordance with an approved critical areas report, so as to result in no overall net loss of shoreline ecological function provided by the critical area and no increased risk of hazards. Alterations that exceed the allowances of or that do not meet the approval criteria of this chapter can only be authorized through a shoreline variance consistent with SMC 20.220.040. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.053 Mitigation requirements.

Mitigation shall ensure that each permitted development or use will not cause a net loss of ecological functions of the shoreline as provided by the critical area or buffer and prevent risk from a hazard posed by a critical area. Mitigation shall not be implemented until after the Director has provided approval of a critical areas report that includes a mitigation plan.

A.    Mitigation Sequencing. This section applies to mitigation required with all critical areas reviews, approvals, and enforcement pursuant to this chapter. This section is supplemented with specific measures under subchapters for particular critical areas. Mitigation for specific development proposals may include a combination of the measures below and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this section. Before impacting any critical areas or buffers, an applicant shall demonstrate that the following actions have been taken in the following sequential order of preference:

1.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of actions;

2.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocation, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts;

3.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment or by restoring or stabilizing the hazard area through natural, engineering, or other methods;

4.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time through preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

5.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and/or

6.    Monitoring, measuring, and reporting the impact to the Director and taking appropriate corrective measures.

B.    Applicants shall first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before the use of actions to mitigate potential impacts will be allowed. No activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the shoreline ecological functions provided by the critical areas or buffers or has a significant adverse impact on other shoreline functions fostered by the policies of this Master Program and the SMA.

C.    Type, Location, and Timing of Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning or greater reduction of hazard risk would result from an alternative approach or as otherwise allowed in this chapter, mitigation for adverse impacts shall be based on best available science, with preferential consideration given to measures that replace the impacted functions directly and in immediate vicinity of the impact and prior to the activities that will disturb the critical area. Mitigation measures that cannot be implemented prior to the critical area impacts shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora.

1.    The Director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g., project delay lapses past a fisheries window, or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, or general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay shall include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan. The justification shall be verified and approved by the City. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.056 Shoreline restoration projects – Relief from shoreline master program development standards and use regulations.

The City may grant relief from Master Program development standards and use regulations resulting from shoreline restoration projects consistent with criteria and procedures in WAC 173-27-215. Shoreline restoration projects, defined as projects designed to restore impaired ecological functions of a shoreline, shall be reviewed and permitted or approved by the City and any other agency with jurisdiction consistent with criteria established in WAC 173-27-215 and RCW 90.58.580, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.060 Best available science.

A.    Protect Shoreline Ecological Functions Provided by Critical Areas with Special Consideration to Anadromous Fish. Critical area reports and decisions to alter critical areas or buffers shall rely on the best available science to protect the shoreline ecological functions provided by the critical areas and shall give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish, such as salmon and bull trout, and their habitat, where applicable.

B.    Best Available Science to Be Consistent with Criteria. The best available science is that scientific information, obtained through a valid scientific process, that is applicable to the critical area prepared by local, State, or Federal natural resource agencies, a qualified scientific professional, or team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in Chapter 365-195 WAC and RCW 36.70A.172, as amended from time to time.

C.    Characteristics of a Valid Scientific Process. In the context of critical areas protection, a valid scientific process is one that produces reliable information useful in understanding the consequences of a local government’s regulatory decisions, and in developing critical areas policies and development regulations that will be effective in protecting the shoreline ecological functions provided by the critical areas. To determine whether information received during the permit review process is reliable scientific information, the Director shall determine whether the source of the information displays the characteristics of a valid scientific process. Such characteristics are as follows:

1.    Peer Review. The information has been critically reviewed by other persons who are qualified scientific experts in that scientific discipline. The proponents of the information have addressed the criticism of the peer reviewers. Publication in a referenced scientific journal usually indicates that the information has been appropriately peer reviewed;

2.    Methods. The methods used to obtain the information are clearly stated and reproducible. The methods are standardized in the pertinent scientific discipline or, if not, the methods have been appropriately peer reviewed to ensure their reliability and validity;

3.    Logical Conclusions and Reasonable Inferences. The conclusions presented are based on reasonable assumptions supported by other studies and consistent with the general theory underlying the assumptions. The conclusions are logically and reasonably derived from the assumptions and supported by the data presented. Any gaps in information and inconsistencies with other pertinent scientific information are adequately explained;

4.    Quantitative Analysis. The data have been analyzed using appropriate statistical or quantitative methods;

5.    Context. The information is placed in proper context. The assumptions, analytical techniques, data, and conclusions are appropriately framed with respect to the prevailing body of pertinent scientific knowledge; and

6.    References. The assumptions, analytical techniques, and conclusions are well-referenced with citations to relevant, credible literature, and other pertinent existing information.

D.    Nonscientific Information. Nonscientific information, such as anecdotal observations, nonexpert opinion, and hearsay, may supplement scientific information, but it is not an adequate substitute for valid and available scientific information.

E.    Absence of Valid Scientific Information. Where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area, leading to uncertainty about the risk to shoreline ecological function provided by the critical area, for permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area, the Director shall:

1.    Take a “precautionary or a no-risk approach,” which strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved; and

2.    Require application of an effective adaptive management program that relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and nonregulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty. An adaptive management program shall:

a.    Address funding for the research component of the adaptive management program;

b.    Change course based on the results and interpretation of new information that resolves uncertainties; and

c.    Commit to the appropriate time frame and scale necessary to reliably evaluate regulatory and nonregulatory actions affecting protection of critical areas and anadromous fisheries. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.070 Classification and rating of critical areas.

To promote consistent application of the standards and requirements of this chapter, critical areas within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction shall be rated or classified according to their characteristics, function and value, and/or their sensitivity to disturbance. Classification of critical areas shall be determined by the City using the following tools:

A.    Application of the criteria contained in these regulations;

B.    Consideration of the critical area reports submitted by qualified professionals in connection with applications subject to these regulations; and

C.    Review of maps adopted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.080 Critical area report – Requirements.

A.    Report Required. If uses, activities, or developments are proposed within, adjacent to, or are likely to impact critical areas or their buffers, an applicant shall provide site-specific information and analysis in the form of critical area report(s) as required in this chapter. Critical area reports are required in order to identify the presence, extent, and classification/rating of potential critical areas, as well as to analyze, assess, and mitigate the potential adverse impact to or risk from critical areas for a development project.

F.    Existing Reports. Unless otherwise provided, a critical areas report may incorporate, be supplemented by, or composed of any reports or studies required by other laws and regulations or previously prepared for and applicable to the development proposal site, as approved by the Director. At the discretion of the Director, reports previously compiled or submitted as part of a proposal for development may be used as a critical areas report to the extent that the requirements of this section and the report requirements for each specific critical area type are met. Critical areas reports shall be considered valid for five years; after such date the City shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary. Supplemental critical area report(s) may be required to provide information and analysis to address changes to the project scope and potential impacts to or changes to applicable regulations that have been made subsequent to existing, valid critical area reports.

G.    Modifications to Report Requirements.

1.    Limitations to Study Area. The Director may limit the required geographic area of the critical areas report as appropriate if:

a.    The applicant, with assistance from the City, cannot obtain permission to access properties adjacent to the project area; or

b.    The proposed activity will affect only a limited part of the subject site.

2.    Modifications to Required Contents. The applicant may consult with the Director prior to or during preparation of the critical areas report to obtain approval of modifications to the required contents of the report where, in the judgment of a qualified professional, more or less information is required to adequately address the potential critical area impacts and required mitigation. In some cases, such as when it is determined that no geologic hazard area is present, a full report may not be necessary to determine compliance with the critical area regulations, this chapter, and in those cases a letter or reconnaissance only report may be required.

3.    Additional Information Requirements. The Director may require additional information to be included in the critical areas report when determined to be necessary to the review of the proposed activity in accordance with this chapter. Additional information that may be required includes, but is not limited to:

a.    Historical data, including original and subsequent mapping, aerial photographs, data compilations and summaries, and available reports and records relating to the site or past operations at the site;

b.    Grading and drainage plans; and

c.    Information specific to the type, location, and nature of the critical area. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

The establishment of buffer areas shall be required for all development proposals and activities in or adjacent to critical areas within the shoreline jurisdiction. In all cases the standard buffer shall apply unless the Director determines that additional buffer width is necessary or reduced buffer is sufficient to protect the shoreline ecological functions consistent with the provisions of this chapter, this Master Program, the SMA, and the recommendations of a qualified professional. The purpose of the buffer shall be to protect the integrity, function, value, and resources of the subject critical area for shoreline ecological function, and/or to protect life, property, and resources from risks associated with development on unstable or critical lands. The buffer shall consist of an undisturbed area of native vegetation. Buffers shall be protected during construction by placement of a temporary barricade if determined necessary by the City, on-site notice for construction crews of the presence of the critical area, and implementation of appropriate erosion and sedimentation controls. Restrictive covenants or conservation easements may be required to preserve and protect buffer areas. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.100 Notice to title.

A critical area notice to title is required, as a condition of permit issuance or project approval, when a permit or development application is submitted for development on any property containing a critical area or buffer within the shoreline jurisdiction. The purpose is to inform subsequent purchasers of real property of the existence of critical areas. The notice to title applicable to the property shall be approved by the Director and City Attorney for compliance with this provision and be filed by the property owner, at their expense, with the King County Recorder’s Office. This requirement can be met through recording of a notice to title prepared by the City, establishment of a critical area tract, or recording of native growth protection area easement consistent with the following provisions:

A.    Notice to Title. A notice to title is required when a permit is required for development on any property containing a critical area or buffer within the shoreline jurisdiction. The notice shall state that critical areas or buffers have been identified on the property within the shoreline jurisdiction and that limitations on actions in or affecting the critical area or buffer may exist. The notice shall run with the land. The title holder will have the right to challenge this notice and to have it extinguished if the critical area designation no longer applies. However, the titleholder shall be responsible for completing a critical area report, subject to approval by the Director, before the notice on title can be extinguished.

B.    Critical Area Tract. Subdivisions, short subdivisions, and binding site plans shall establish a separate critical areas tract as a permanent protective measure for wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and landslide hazard areas and their buffers located within the shoreline jurisdiction. The plat or binding site plan for the project shall clearly depict the critical areas tract, and shall include all of the subject critical area, any required buffer, and any additional lands included voluntarily by the developer. Restrictions to development within the critical area tract shall be clearly noted on the plat or plan. Restrictions shall be consistent with the SMA, this Master Program, and this chapter for the entire critical area tract. Should the critical area tract include several types of critical areas, the developer may establish separate critical areas tracts.

C.    Native Growth Protection Area. Native growth protection area (NGPA) easements shall be required on a property where no subdivision, short subdivision, or binding site plan is proposed or required. Unless otherwise required in this chapter, NGPA easements shall be recorded on title for all affected parcels prior to approval of a development agreement, issuance of a master development plan permit, or issuance of a site development or building permit, when two or more dwelling units and/or nonresidential developments are proposed on one parcel, to delineate and protect those contiguous wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation, and landslide hazard critical areas and their buffers located within the shoreline jurisdiction. The easement to be recorded shall clearly depict the critical area and the limits of the NGPA easement and shall include all of the subject critical area(s) and any required buffer(s). Restrictions to development within the NGPA easement shall be clearly noted in the easement and shall include the following:

1.    That native vegetation will be preserved for the purpose of preventing harm to property and the environment, including, but not limited to, controlling surface water runoff and erosion; limiting chemical applications of hazardous substances (pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers); maintaining slope stability; buffering; and protecting plants, fish, and animal habitat; and

2.    The right of the City to enforce the terms of the restriction.

D.    Proof of Notice. The applicant shall submit proof that the notice has been recorded on title before the City approves any development permit, including master development plan permits, for the property or, in the case of subdivisions, short subdivisions, binding site plans, or development agreements, at or before recording. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.110 Permanent field marking.

A.    All critical areas tracts, easements, and dedications, or as recommended by a qualified professional, shall be clearly marked on the site using permanent markings, placed at least every 50 feet, which include the following text:

City of Shoreline Designated Critical Area. Activities, including clearing and grading, removal of vegetation, pruning, cutting of trees or shrubs, planting of nonnative species, and other alterations may be prohibited. Help protect and care for this area. Please contact the City of Shoreline with questions or concerns.

B.    It is the responsibility of the landowner to maintain in perpetuity and replace if necessary all permanent field markings. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.120 Financial guarantee requirements.

Bonds and other financial guarantees, and associated performance agreements or maintenance/defect/monitoring agreements, shall be required for projects with required mitigation or restoration of impacts to critical areas or critical area buffers consistent with the following:

A.    A performance agreement and bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, are required from the applicant when mitigation required pursuant to a development proposal is not completed prior to final permit approval, such as final plat approval or final building inspection. The amount of the performance bond(s) shall equal 125 percent of the cost of the mitigation project (after City mobilization is calculated).

B.    A performance agreement and bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, are required from the applicant when restoration is required for remediation of a critical area violation. The amount of the performance bond(s) shall equal 125 percent of the cost of the mitigation project (after City mobilization is calculated).

C.    A maintenance/defect/monitoring agreement and bond, or other acceptable financial guarantee, are required to ensure the applicant’s compliance with the conditions of the approved mitigation plan pursuant to a development proposal or restoration plan for remediation of a violation. The amount of the maintenance bond(s) shall equal 25 percent of the cost of the mitigation project (after City mobilization is calculated) in addition to the cost for monitoring for a minimum of five years. The monitoring portion of the financial guarantee may be reduced in proportion to work successfully completed over the period of the bond. The bonding period shall coincide with the monitoring period. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.130 Unauthorized critical area alterations.

A.    When a critical area or its buffer located within the shoreline jurisdiction has been altered in violation of this chapter, all ongoing development work shall stop and the critical area shall be restored. The City shall have the authority to issue a stop work order to cease all development, and order restoration measures at the owner’s or other responsible party’s expense to remediate the impacts of the violation of the provisions of this chapter.

B.    Requirement for Restoration Plan. All development shall remain stopped until a restoration plan is prepared by the responsible party and an approved permit is issued by the City. Such a plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional using the best available science and shall describe how the actions proposed meet the minimum requirements described in subsection C of this section. The Director may, at the responsible party’s expense, seek expert advice, including but not limited to third party review by a qualified professional under contract with or employed by the City, in determining if the plan meets the minimum performance standards for restoration. Submittal, review, and approval of required restoration plans for remediation of violations of this chapter, SMP Critical Areas Regulations, shall be completed through a site development permit application process.

C.    Minimum Performance Standards for Restoration.

1.    For alterations to aquifer recharge areas, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, the following minimum performance standards shall be met for the restoration; provided, that if the violator can demonstrate that greater shoreline ecological functions provided through the functions and values provided by these critical areas can be obtained, these standards may be modified:

a.    The previolation function and values of the affected critical areas and buffers shall be restored, including water quality and habitat functions;

b.    The critical area and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation that replicates the vegetation historically, or previolation, found on the site in species types, sizes, and densities. The previolation functions and values should be replicated at the location of the alteration; and

c.    Information demonstrating compliance with the requirements in SMC 20.240.082, Mitigation plan requirements, and the applicable mitigation sections for the affected type(s) of critical area(s) and their buffer(s) shall be submitted to the Director with a complete site development permit application.

2.    For alterations to flood hazard and geologic hazard areas, the following minimum performance standards shall be met for the restoration of a critical area; provided, that if the violator can demonstrate that greater safety can be obtained, these standards may be modified:

a.    The hazard shall be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, the previolation hazard;

b.    Any risk of personal injury resulting from the alteration shall be eliminated or minimized; and

c.    The hazard area and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation sufficient to minimize the hazard and restore the functions and values.

D.    Site Investigation. The Director is authorized to take such actions as are necessary to enforce this chapter. The Director shall present proper credentials and obtain permission before entering onto private property.

E.    Penalties. Any responsible party violating any of the provisions of this chapter may be subject to any applicable penalties per SMC 20.30.770, WAC 173-27-240, and RCW 90.58.200 and 90.58.210, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

Subchapter 2.

Geologic Hazard Areas


20.240.210 Geologic hazards – Designation and purpose.

A.    Geologic hazard areas are those lands that are susceptible to erosion, landsliding, seismic, or other geological events as identified by WAC 365-190-120, as amended from time to time. These areas may not be suited for development activities because these areas may pose a threat to public health and safety. These areas also provide important shoreline ecological functions. Eroding coastal bluffs, called feeder bluffs, are the primary source of sediment for Puget Sound beaches and contribute to vital coastal processes. However, since most of the city’s coastline consists of BNSF railroad right-of-way, opportunity for the natural erosion and sediment transport process is limited.

Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as geologic hazard areas:

1.    Landslide hazard;

2.    Seismic hazard;

3.    Erosion hazard.

B.    The primary purposes of geologic hazard area regulations are to avoid and minimize potential impacts to life and property from geologic hazards, conserve soil resources, protect shoreline ecological functions, and minimize structural damage relating to seismic hazards. This purpose shall be accomplished through appropriate levels of study and analysis, application of sound engineering principles, and regulation or limitation of land uses, including maintenance of existing vegetation, regulation of clearing and grading activities, and control of stormwater. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.220 Geologic hazards – Classification.

Geologic hazard areas shall be classified according to the criteria in this section as follows:

A.    Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are those areas potentially subject to landslide activity based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrogeologic factors as classified in subsection B of this section with slopes 15 percent or steeper within a vertical elevation change of at least 10 feet or all areas of prior landslide activity regardless of slope. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top, and measuring the inclination over 10 feet of vertical relief (see Figure 20.240.220(A)). The edges of the geologic hazard are identified where the characteristics of the slope cross-section change from one landslide hazard classification to another, or no longer meet any classification. Additionally:

1.    The toe of a slope is a distinct topographic break that separates slopes inclined at less than 15 percent from slopes above that are 15 percent or steeper when measured over 10 feet of vertical relief; and

2.    The top of a slope is a distinct topographic break that separates slopes inclined at less than 15 percent from slopes below that are 15 percent or steeper when measured over 10 feet of vertical relief.

B.    Landslide Hazard Area Classification. Landslide hazard areas are classified as follows:

1.    Moderate to High Risk.

a.    Areas with slopes between 15 percent and 40 percent and that are underlain by soils that consist largely of sand, gravel, or glacial till that do not meet the criteria for very high risk areas in subsection (B)(2) of this section;

b.    Areas with slopes between 15 percent and 40 percent that are underlain by soils consisting largely of silt and clay and do not meet the criteria for very high risk areas in subsection (B)(2) of this section; or

c.    All slopes of 10 to 20 feet in height that are 40 percent slope or steeper and do not meet the criteria for very high risk in subsection (B)(2)(a) or (b) of this section.

2.    Very High Risk.

a.    Areas with slopes steeper than 15 percent with zones of emergent water (e.g., springs or ground water seepage);

b.    Areas of landslide activity (scarps, movement, or accumulated debris) regardless of slope; or

c.    All slopes that are 40 percent or steeper and more than 20 feet in height when slope is averaged over 10 vertical feet of relief.

C.    Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are lands that, due to a combination of soil and ground water conditions, are subject to risk of ground shaking, lateral spreading, or subsidence or liquefaction of soils during earthquakes. These areas are typically underlain by soft or loose saturated soils (such as alluvium) or peat deposits and have a shallow ground water table. These areas are designated as having “high” and “moderate to high” risk of liquefaction as mapped on the Liquefaction Susceptibility and Site Class Maps of Western Washington State by County by DNR.

D.    Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are lands or areas underlain by soils identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service) as having “severe” or “very severe” erosion hazards. This includes, but is not limited to, the following group of soils when such soils occur on slopes of 15 percent or greater: Alderwood-Kitsap (AkF), Alderwood gravelly sandy loam (AgD), Kitsap silt loam (KpD), Everett (EvD), and Indianola (InD). (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.222 Geologic hazards – Mapping.

A.    The approximate location and extent of geologic hazard areas are shown on City of Shoreline geologic hazard data layers maintained in the City geographic information system (GIS) and shown in Figure 20.230.080. In addition, the following maps and resources providing information on the location and extent of geologic hazard areas are hereby adopted by reference as amended:

1.    Department of Ecology coastal zone atlas (for marine bluffs);

2.    U.S. Geological Survey geologic maps, landslide hazard maps, and seismic hazard maps;

3.    DNR seismic hazard maps for Western Washington, including, but not limited to, the Liquefaction Susceptibility and Site Class Maps of Western Washington State by County;

4.    DNR slope stability maps; and

5.    Soils maps produced by the USDA National Resources Conservation Service.

B.    The critical areas maps and the resources cited above are to be used as a guide for the City of Shoreline Planning and Community Development Department, project applicants, and/or property owners and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. These maps and resources are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.224 Geologic hazards – Development standards.

A.    Development, activities, and uses shall be allowed in geologic hazard areas and their required buffers only as provided for in this chapter.

B.    Activities Allowed in All Geologic Hazard Areas and Buffers. The activities listed below are allowed in the identified geologic hazard areas types pursuant to SMC 20.240.040, Allowed activities, and subject to applicable permit approvals. These activities do not require submission of a critical area report.

1.    All allowed activities per SMC 20.240.040;

2.    Installation of fences as allowed without a building permit in Chapter 20.50 SMC, General Development Standards; and

3.    Nonstructural interior remodel, maintenance, or repair of structures that do not meet the standards of this chapter, if the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or height of the structure and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed maintenance or repair.

C.    Alteration. The City may approve, condition, or deny proposals in a geologic hazard area based upon the effective mitigation of risks posed to property, health and safety, and compensation of the loss of shoreline ecological functions. The objective of mitigation measures shall be to render a site containing a geologic hazard as safe as one not containing such hazard. Conditions may include applicable stormwater management practices, limitations of proposed uses, modification of density, alteration of site layout, and other appropriate changes to the proposal.

Where potential impacts cannot be effectively mitigated to ensure no net loss of the shoreline ecological functions provided by the critical area, and to eliminate a significant risk to public health and safety, and property or other critical area, the proposal shall be denied, except as granted by a shoreline variance consistent with SMC 20.220.040.

D.    Alteration of Moderate to High Risk Landslide Hazards. Development activities and uses that result in unavoidable alterations may be permitted in moderate to high risk landslide hazard areas or their buffers in accordance with an approved geologic hazard critical area report. The recommendations contained within the critical area report shall be incorporated into the proposed alteration of the landslide hazard area or its buffers.

The critical area report shall certify that:

1.    The risk of damage from the proposal, both on site and off site, is minimal subject to the conditions set forth in the report;

2.    The proposal will not increase the risk of occurrence of the potential landslide hazard; and

3.    Measures to eliminate or reduce risks have been incorporated into the report’s recommendations and project development plans.

E.    Alteration of Very High Risk Landslide Hazard Areas. Alterations of a very high risk landslide hazard area and/or buffer may only occur for activities for which a critical area report with a hazards analysis is submitted and certifies that:

1.    The development will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation on site or to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions;

2.    The development will not decrease slope stability on the site or on adjacent properties;

3.    Such alterations will meet other critical areas regulations; and

4.    The design criteria in subsection F of this section are met.

F.    Design Criteria for Alteration of Very High Risk Landslide Hazard Areas. Development within a very high risk landslide hazard area and/or buffer shall be designed to meet the following basic requirements unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative project design provides greater short- and long-term slope stability while meeting all other provisions of this chapter. The requirement for long-term slope stability shall exclude designs that require regular and periodic maintenance to maintain their level of function. The basic development design criteria are:

1.    The proposed development shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.5 for static conditions and 1.2 for dynamic conditions. Proposed alteration of natural slopes, that does not include structures, shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.3 for static conditions and 1.0 for seismic. Where the existing conditions are below these limits, the proposed development shall increase the factor of safety to these limits or will not be permitted. Analysis of dynamic conditions shall be based on the seismic event as established by the current version of the International Building Code;

2.    New structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologic hazard areas and other critical areas;

3.    New structures and improvements shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope, and foundations shall be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography;

4.    New structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation;

5.    The proposed development shall not result in greater risk of the hazard or a need for increased buffers on neighboring properties;

6.    Where the existing natural slope area cannot be retained undisturbed with native vegetation, the use of retaining walls that allow the maintenance of existing natural slope area is preferred over graded artificial slopes; and

7.    Development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage and preserve native vegetation and trees to the maximum extent practicable.

G.    Additional Requirements for Alteration of Very High Risk Hazard Landslide Areas.

1.    Prior to application, the applicant shall meet the requirements of and conduct a neighborhood meeting consistent with SMC 20.30.090. The notification area shall be limited to:

a.    All property owners whose properties adjoin the subject property; and

d.    Informs subsequent owners of the property of the risks and the covenant; and

e.    Advisability of obtaining added insurance.

3.    Prior to permit issuance, the piling and excavation contractors shall submit insurance bonding documentation that includes coverage for subsidence and underground property damage, listing the City as an additional insured. The Director may require adequate bonds and/or insurance to cover potential claims for property damage that may arise from or be related to the following:

a.    Excavation or fill within a landslide-prone area when the depth of the proposed excavation exceeds four feet and the bottom of the proposed excavation is below the 100 percent slope line (45 degrees from a horizontal line) from the property line; or

b.    In other circumstances where the Director determines that there is a potential for significant harm to any type of critical area or a critical area buffer during the construction process.

4.    If the Building Official has reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists because significant changes in geologic conditions at a project site or in the surrounding area may have occurred since a permit was issued, increasing the risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to nearby surface waters, the Building Official may, by letter or other reasonable means of notification, suspend the permit until the applicant has submitted a letter of certification. The letter of certification shall be based on such factors as the presence of known slides, indications of changed conditions at the site or the surrounding area, or other indications of unstable soils and meet the following requirements:

a.    The letter of certification shall be from the current project qualified professional geotechnical engineer of record stating that a qualified professional geotechnical engineer has inspected the site and area surrounding the proposed development within the 60 days preceding submittal of the letter; and that:

i.    In the project geotechnical engineer’s professional opinion no significant changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that render invalid or out-of-date the analysis and recommendations contained in the technical reports and other application materials previously submitted to the City as part of the application for the permit; or that

ii.    In the project geotechnical engineer’s professional opinion, changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that require revision to project criteria and that all technical reports and any necessary revised drawings that account for the changed conditions have been prepared and submitted.

5.    The letter of certification and any required revisions shall be reviewed and approved by the City’s third party qualified professional, at the applicant’s expense, before the Building Official may allow work to continue under the permit.

H.    Alteration of Seismic Hazard Areas. Development activities and uses in seismic hazard areas may be permitted, based on review of a critical area report demonstrating that the project is consistent with SMC 20.240.053(A)(2) through (6). The report shall certify that the risks of damage from the proposal, both on site and off site, are minimal subject to the conditions set forth in the report, that the proposal will not increase the risk of occurrence of the potential hazard, and that measures to eliminate or reduce risks have been incorporated into the report’s recommendations. The report shall include the following:

1.    For one-story and two-story detached residential structures, a qualified professional shall conduct an evaluation of site response and liquefaction potential based on current mapping, site reconnaissance, and research of nearby studies.

2.    For all other proposals, the qualified professional shall conduct an evaluation of site response and liquefaction potential including sufficient subsurface exploration to determine the site coefficient for use in the static lateral force procedure described in the International Building Code.

I.    Alteration of Erosion Hazard Areas. Development activities and uses in erosion hazard areas may be permitted, based on review of a critical area report demonstrating that the project is consistent with SMC 20.240.053(A)(2) through (6) and the following provisions:

1.    All development proposals on sites containing erosion hazard areas shall include a stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the requirements of the adopted stormwater manual and a mitigation plan to ensure revegetation and permanent stabilization of the site. Specific requirements for revegetation in mitigation plans shall be consistent with the mitigation plan requirements in SMC 20.240.082 and the mitigation performance standards for geologic hazard areas in SMC 20.240.250. Revegetation for site stabilization may be combined with required landscape, tree retention, and/or other critical area mitigation plans as appropriate.

2.    All subdivisions, short subdivisions, or binding site plans on sites with erosion hazard areas shall comply with the following additional requirements:

a.    Except as provided in this section, existing vegetation shall be retained on all lots until building permits are approved for development on individual lots;

b.    If any vegetation on the lots is damaged or removed during construction of the subdivision infrastructure, the applicant shall be required to implement the revegetation plan in those areas that have been impacted prior to final inspection of the site development permit or the issuance of any building permit for the subject property;

c.    Clearing of vegetation on individual lots may be allowed prior to building permit approval if the City determines that:

i.    Such clearing is a necessary part of a large-scale grading plan;

ii.    It is not feasible to perform such grading on an individual lot basis; and

iii.    Drainage from the graded area will meet established water quality standards.

3.    Where the City determines that erosion from a development site poses a significant risk of damage to downstream receiving water, the applicant shall be required to provide regular monitoring of surface water discharge from the site during the project construction or installation. If the project does not meet water quality standards, the City may suspend further development work on the site until such standards are met.

4.    The City may require additional mitigation measures in erosion hazard areas, including, but not limited to, the restriction of major soil-disturbing activities associated with site development between October 1st and April 30th to meet the stated purpose contained in SMC 20.240.010 and 20.240.210.

5.    The use of hazardous substances, pesticides, and fertilizers in erosion hazard areas may be prohibited by the City. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.230 Geologic hazard areas – Required buffer areas.

A.    Buffers for geologic hazard areas shall be maintained as undisturbed native vegetation consistent with SMC 20.240.090. Building and other improvement setbacks will be required in addition to buffers as recommended by the qualified professional to allow for landscaping, access around structures for maintenance, and location of stormwater facilities at safe distances from geologic hazard areas where native vegetation is not necessary to reduce the risk of the hazard.

B.    Required buffer widths for geologic hazard areas shall reflect the sensitivity of the hazard area and the risks associated with development and, in those circumstances permitted by these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity and site design proposed to be conducted on or near the area.

C.    In determining the appropriate buffer width, the City shall consider the recommendations contained in a geotechnical critical area report required by these regulations.

D.    For moderate to high risk landslide hazard areas, the qualified professional shall recommend whether buffers should be required and the width of those buffers, as well as recommending any additional setbacks for buildings and stormwater facilities adequate to certify no increase in the risk of the hazard.

E.    For very high risk landslide hazard areas, the standard buffer shall be 50 feet from all edges of the landslide hazard area. Larger buffers may be required as needed to eliminate or minimize the risk to people and property based on a geotechnical critical area report. The standard buffer may be reduced when geotechnical studies demonstrate, and the qualified professional certifies, that the reduction will not increase the risk of hazard to people or property, on or off site; however, the minimum buffer shall be 15 feet.

F.    Landslide hazard areas and associated buffers shall be placed either in a separate tract on which development is prohibited, protected by execution of an easement, dedicated to a conservation organization or land trust, or similarly preserved through a permanent protective mechanism acceptable to the City. The location and limitations associated with the critical landslide hazard and its buffer shall be shown on the face of the deed or plat applicable to the property and shall be recorded with the King County Recorder’s Office. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

(Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

Subchapter 3.

Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas


20.240.260 Fish and wildlife habitat – Description and purpose.

A.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas (or habitat conservation areas) are lands managed for maintaining populations of species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that the habitat available is sufficient to support viable populations over the long term and isolated subpopulations are not created. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas include areas with which State and Federal designated threatened, endangered, and sensitive species have a primary association as well as priority species and habitats listed by WDFW, including corridors that connect priority habitat, and those areas that provide habitat for species of local significance, which have been or may be identified in the City of Shoreline Comprehensive Plan. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas also include stream areas and buffers that provide important habitat corridors; help maintain water quality; store and convey stormwater and floodwater; recharge ground water; and serve as areas for recreation, education, scientific study, and aesthetic appreciation.

B.    The purpose of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be to protect and conserve the habitat of fish and wildlife species and thereby maintain or increase their populations. The primary purpose of this section is to minimize development impacts to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and to:

1.    Protect Federal and State listed habitats and species and give special attention to protection and enhancement of anadromous fish populations; and

2.    Maintain a diversity of species and habitat within the City; and

3.    Coordinate habitat protection to maintain and provide habitat connections; and

4.    Help maintain air and water quality and control erosion. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.270 Fish and wildlife habitat – Classification and designation.

A.    The City designates the following fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas that meet one or more of the criteria in subsection B of this section, regardless of any formal identification, as critical area, and as such, these areas are subject to the provisions of this chapter. These areas shall be managed consistent with best available science, including WDFW’s Management Recommendations for Priority Habitat and Species. The following fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are specifically designated, and this designation does not preclude designation of additional areas as consistent with the criteria in subsection B of this section:

1.    All regulated streams and wetlands and their associated buffers as determined by a qualified specialist.

2.    The waters, bed, and shoreline of Puget Sound up to the OHWM.

B.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are those areas designated by the City based on review of the best available science; input from WDFW, the Department of Ecology, USACE, and other agencies; and any of the following criteria:

1.    Areas where State or Federally Designated Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species Have a Primary Association.

a.    Federally designated endangered and threatened species are those fish and wildlife species identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service that are in danger of extinction or threatened to become endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service should be consulted for current listing status. Federally designated endangered and threatened species known to be identified and mapped by the Washington State Department of Wildlife in Shoreline include, but may not be limited to, the following:

i.    Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha);

ii.    Southern resident orca or killer whales (Orcinus orca).

b.    State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are those fish and wildlife species native to the State of Washington that are in danger of extinction, threatened to become endangered, vulnerable, or declining and are likely to become endangered or threatened in a significant portion of their range within the State without cooperative management or removal of threats as identified by WDFW. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are periodically recorded in WAC 232-12-014 (State endangered species) and WAC 232-12-011 (State threatened and sensitive species), as amended from time to time. WDFW maintains the most current listing and should be consulted for current listing status. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species known to be identified and mapped by WDFW in Shoreline include, but may not be limited to, the following:

i.    Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis);

ii.    Purple martin (Progne subis).

2.    State Priority Habitats and Species. Priority habitats and species are considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status; sensitivity to habitat alteration; and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by WDFW in the Priority Habitats and Species List. Priority habitats and species known to be identified and mapped by WDFW in Shoreline include, but may not be limited to, the following:

a.    Biodiversity areas and corridors identified and mapped along Boeing Creek and in and around Innis Arden Reserve Park;

b.    Chinook/fall chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha);

c.    Coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch);

d.    Dungeness crab (Cancer magister);

e.    Estuarine intertidal aquatic habitat;

f.    Geoduck (Panopea abrupta);

g.    Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis);

h.    Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus);

i.    Purple martin (Progne subis);

j.    Resident coastal cutthroat (Oncorhynchus clarki);

k.    Surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosus); and

l.    Winter steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

3.    Commercial and Recreational Shellfish Areas. These areas include all public and private tidelands or bedlands suitable for shellfish harvest, including shellfish protection districts established pursuant to Chapter 90.72 RCW, as amended from time to time.

4.    Kelp and Eelgrass Beds and Herring and Smelt Spawning Areas.

5.    Waters of the State. Waters of the State include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the State of Washington, as classified in WAC 222-16-030, as amended from time to time. Streams are those areas where surface waters produce a defined channel or bed, not including irrigation ditches, canals, storm or surface water runoff devices, or other entirely artificial watercourses, unless such watercourses are used by fish or are used to convey streams naturally occurring prior to construction. A channel or bed need not contain water year round; provided, that there is evidence of at least intermittent flow during years of normal rainfall. Streams shall be classified in accordance with the DNR water typing system (WAC 222-16-030), hereby adopted in its entirety by reference and summarized as follows:

a.    Type S: streams inventoried as “shorelines of the State” under the SMA and the rules promulgated pursuant to the SMA, as amended from time to time;

b.    Type F: streams that contain fish habitat. Not all streams that are known to exist with fish habitat support anadromous fish populations, or have the potential for anadromous fish occurrence because of obstructions, blockages, or access restrictions resulting from existing conditions. Therefore, in order to provide special consideration of and increased protection for anadromous fish in the application of development standards, shoreline streams shall be further classified as follows:

i.    Anadromous Fish-Bearing Streams (Type F-Anadromous). These streams include:

(A)    Fish-bearing streams where naturally recurring use by anadromous fish populations has been documented by a government agency;

(B)    Streams that are fish passable or have the potential to be fish passable by anadromous populations, including those from Lake Washington or Puget Sound, as determined by a qualified professional based on review of stream flow, gradient and natural barriers (i.e., natural features that exceed jumping height for salmonids), and criteria for fish passability established by WDFW; and

(C)    Streams that are planned for restoration in a six-year capital improvement plan adopted by a government agency or planned for removal of the private dams that will result in a fish-passable connection to Lake Washington or Puget Sound; and

ii.    Nonanadromous Fish-Bearing Streams (Type F-Nonanadromous). These include streams that contain existing or potential fish habitat, but do not have the potential for anadromous fish use due to natural barriers to fish passage, including streams that contain resident or isolated fish populations.

The general areas and stream reaches with access for anadromous fish are indicated in the City of Shoreline Stream and Wetland Inventory and Assessment (2004) and basin plans. The potential for anadromous fish access shall be confirmed in the field by a qualified professional as part of a critical area report;

c.    Type Np: perennial nonfish habitat streams;

d.    Type Ns: seasonal nonfish habitat streams; and

e.    Piped stream segments: those segments of streams, regardless of their type, that are fully enclosed in an underground pipe or culvert. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.272 Fish and wildlife habitat – Mapping.

A.    Mapping. The approximate location and extent of fish and wildlife habitat areas are shown in the data layers maintained in the City geographic information system (GIS) and shown in Figure 20.230.080. In addition, the following maps and inventories are hereby adopted by reference as amended:

1.    WDFW Priority Habitat and Species maps;

2.    DNR Official Water Type Reference maps;

3.    DNR Puget Sound Intertidal Habitat Inventory maps;

4.    DNR Shorezone Inventory;

5.    DNR Natural Heritage Program mapping data;

6.    Washington State Department of Health Annual Inventory of Shellfish Harvest Areas;

7.    Anadromous and resident salmonid distribution maps contained in the Habitat Limiting Factors reports published by the Washington State Conservation Commission; and

8.    DNR State Natural Area Preserves and Natural Resource Conservation Area maps.

B.    The inventories and cited maps and resources are to be used as a guide for the City, project applicants, and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are identified or critical area reports are submitted for known fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. The inventories, maps, and resources are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.274 Fish and wildlife habitat – General development standards.

A.    Development activities and uses shall be prohibited in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and associated buffers, except as provided for in this subchapter. Unless allowed under SMC 20.240.040, subsection C of this section, or SMC 20.240.276, development activities and uses that result in alteration of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be subject to the shoreline variance provisions of 20.220.040.

B.    Any proposed alterations permitted, consistent with shoreline variance review, to fish and wildlife habitat conservation area shall require the preparation of a habitat conservation area mitigation plan (commonly referred to as a habitat management plan) to mitigate for the adverse impacts of the proposal, consistent with the recommendations specific to the habitat or species of the WDFW Priority Habitat Program. The habitat management plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional and reviewed and approved by the City, consistent with the standards for mitigation plans in SMC 20.240.082 and 20.240.300.

C.    Activities Allowed in Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas. The activities listed below are allowed in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas pursuant to SMC 20.240.040, Allowed activities, and subject to applicable permit approvals. These activities do not require the submission of a critical area report and are exempt from monitoring and financial guarantee requirements, except where such activities result in a loss of the functions and values of a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area. These activities include:

1.    Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and/or other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing habitat conservation area.

2.    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

3.    Permitted alteration to a legally constructed structure existing within a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffer that does not increase the footprint of the development or hardscape or increase the impact to a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, consistent with SMC 20.220.150.

4.    Clearing, grading, and the construction of fences and arbors are allowed within the required 10-foot stream buffers for a piped stream segment if no other critical area or buffer is present.

D.    Nonindigenous Species. No plant, wildlife, or fish species not indigenous to the region shall be introduced into a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area unless authorized by a State or Federal permit or approval.

E.    Mitigation and Contiguous Corridors. Mitigation sites shall be located to preserve or achieve contiguous wildlife habitat corridors in accordance with a mitigation plan that is part of an approved critical area report to minimize the isolating effects of development on habitat areas, so long as mitigation of aquatic habitat is located within the same aquatic ecosystem as the area disturbed.

F.    Approvals of Activities. The Director shall condition approvals of development activities allowed within or adjacent to a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, as necessary to minimize or mitigate any potential adverse impacts. Conditions shall be based on the best available science and may include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.    Establishment of buffers;

6.    Requirement of a performance bond, when necessary, to ensure completion and success of proposed mitigation.

G.    Mitigation and Equivalent or Greater Shoreline Ecological Functions. Mitigation of alterations to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall achieve equivalent or greater shoreline ecological, biological, and hydrologic functions and shall include mitigation for adverse impacts upstream from, downstream from, or within the same shoreline reach as the development proposal site. Mitigation shall address each function affected by the alteration to achieve functional equivalency or improvement on a per function basis. Mitigation shall be located on site except when demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an off-site location. Mitigation shall be detailed in a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area mitigation plan, consistent with the requirements of SMC 20.240.300.

H.    Approvals and the Best Available Science. Any approval of alterations or impacts to a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area shall be supported by the best available science.

I.    Buffers.

1.    Establishment of Buffers. The Director shall require the establishment of buffer areas for activities adjacent to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas in order to protect fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Buffers shall consist of an undisturbed area of native vegetation or areas identified for restoration established to protect the integrity, functions, and values of the affected habitat. Required buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the habitat and the type and intensity of human activity proposed to be conducted nearby and shall be consistent with the applicable management recommendations issued by WDFW.

2.    Seasonal Restrictions. When a species is more susceptible to adverse impacts during specific periods of the year, seasonal restrictions may apply. Larger buffers may be required and activities may be further restricted during the specified season.

3.    Habitat Buffer Averaging. The Director may allow the recommended fish and wildlife habitat area buffer width to be reduced in accordance with a critical area report, the best available science, and the applicable management recommendations issued by WDFW, only if:

a.    It will not reduce stream or habitat functions;

b.    It will not adversely affect fish and wildlife habitat;

c.    It will provide additional natural resource protection, such as buffer enhancement;

d.    The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and

e.    The buffer width is not reduced by more than 25 percent in any location.

J.    Signs and Fencing of Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas.

1.    Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer and the clearing limits identified by an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field with temporary “clearing limits” fencing in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur. The marking is subject to inspection by the Director prior to the commencement of permitted activities during the preconstruction meeting required under SMC 20.50.330(E). This temporary marking and fencing shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

2.    Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the Director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer, when recommended in a critical area report or otherwise required by the provisions of this chapter.

a.    Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post or another material of equal durability and nonhazardous. Signs shall be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and shall be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The signs shall be worded consistent with the text specified in SMC 20.240.110 or with alternative language approved by the Director.

b.    The provisions of subsection (J)(2)(a) of this section may be modified as necessary to assure protection of sensitive features or wildlife.

3.    Fencing. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes habitat impacts. Permanent fencing shall be required at the outer edge of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area buffer under the following circumstances; provided, that the Director may waive this requirement:

a.    As part of any development proposal for subdivisions, short plats, multifamily, mixed use, and commercial development where the Director determines that such fencing is necessary to protect the shoreline ecological functions of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area; provided, that breaks in permanent fencing may be allowed for access to allowed uses (subsection C of this section and SMC 20.240.280(D));

b.    As part of development proposals for public and private parks where the adjacent proposed use is active recreation and the Director determines that such fencing is necessary to protect the shoreline ecological functions of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area;

c.    When buffer averaging is part of a development proposal; or

d.    At the Director’s discretion, to protect the shoreline ecological functions of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, as demonstrated in a critical area report. If found to be necessary, the Director shall condition any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area.

e.    The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer when domestic grazing animals, only as allowed under SMC 20.40.240, are present or may be introduced on site.

K.    Subdivisions. The subdivision and short subdivision of land in fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and associated buffers are subject to the following:

1.    Land that is located wholly within a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer may not be subdivided;

2.    Land that is located partially within a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer may be divided; provided, that the developable portion of each new lot and its access are located outside of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or its buffer. The final lots shall each meet the minimum lot size requirements of SMC 20.50.020;

3.    Access roads and utilities serving the proposed subdivision may be permitted within the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area and associated buffers only if the applicant’s qualified professional(s) demonstrate, and the City determines, that no other feasible alternative exists, all unavoidable impacts are fully mitigated, and the use is consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.276 Fish and wildlife habitat – Specific habitat development standards.

In addition to the provisions in SMC 20.240.274, the following development standards apply to the specific habitat types identified below:

A.    Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species.

2.    Type F-Nonanadromous and Type Np Streams. Development activities and uses that result in alteration of Type F-nonanadromous and Type Np streams are prohibited subject to the shoreline variance provisions of SMC 20.220.040.

3.    Type Ns Streams. Development activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in Type Ns streams and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area(s) report and compensatory mitigation plan, and only if the proposed activity is consistent with the purpose and intent of the SMA, this Master Program, and this chapter. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of streams and buffers shall be provided in compliance with the mitigation performance standards and requirements of these regulations.

4.    Stream Crossing. Crossing of streams may be permitted based on the findings in a critical area report, subject to the limitations in subsections (D)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and consistent with the following:

a.    Bridges. Bridges shall be used to cross Type S and Type F-anadromous streams. Culverted crossings and other obstructive means of crossing Type S and Type F-anadromous streams shall be prohibited; and

b.    Culverts. Culverts are allowed for crossing of Type F-nonanadromous, Np, and Ns streams when fish passage will not be impaired and when the following design criteria and conditions are met:

i.    Oversized culverts, which allow for fish passage and floodplain or wetland connectivity, will be installed;

ii.    Culverts for Type F streams shall be designed for fish passage that will allow natural stream functions and processes to occur (i.e., sediment, wood, and debris transport) where appropriate;

iii.    Gravel substrate will be placed in the bottom of the culvert to a minimum depth of one foot for Type F streams;

iv.    A maintenance covenant shall be recorded on title with King County that requires the property owner to, at all times, keep any culvert free of debris and sediment to allow free passage of water and, if applicable, fish; and

v.    The City may require that a culvert be removed from a stream as a condition of approval, unless it is demonstrated conclusively that the culvert is not detrimental to fish habitat or water quality, or removal would be detrimental to fish or wildlife habitat or water quality.

5.    Relocation. Relocation of a Type S, F, or Np stream may be allowed, subject to the limitations in subsections (D)(1) and (2) of this section, and only when the proposed relocation is part of an approved mitigation or rehabilitation plan, will result in equal or better habitat and water quality, and will not diminish the flow capacity of the stream. Relocation of a Type Ns stream may be allowed, subject to the limitation in subsection (D)(3) of this section, and only when the proposed relocation will result in equal or better habitat and water quality and will not diminish the flow capacity of the stream.

6.    Restoring Piped Watercourses. The City allows the voluntary opening of previously channelized/culverted streams and the rehabilitation and restoration of streams. Restoring piped watercourses may be approved, consistent with the following:

a.    When piped watercourse sections are restored, a protective buffer shall be required of the stream section. The buffer distance shall be consistent with the buffer relief that may be granted consistent with SMC 20.240.056, Shoreline restoration projects. The stream and buffer area shall include habitat improvements and measures to prevent erosion, landslide, and water quality impacts. Opened channels shall be designed to support fish and wildlife habitat and uninhibited fish access, unless determined to be unfeasible as demonstrated in a restoration plan reviewed and approved by the City;

b.    Removal of pipes conveying streams shall only occur when the City determines that the proposal will result in an improvement of water quality and ecological functions and will not significantly increase the threat of erosion, flooding, slope stability, or other hazards; and

c.    Where the buffer of the restored stream would extend onto an adjacent property, the applicant shall obtain a written agreement from the affected neighboring property owner prior to the City approving the restoration of the piped watercourse.

E.    Priority Species. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or buffers with priority species shall be subject to the following:

1.    Development activities and uses that result in unavoidable impacts may be permitted in priority species habitat areas and associated buffers in accordance with an approved critical area(s) report and habitat management plan, only if the proposed activity is consistent with the purpose and intent of the SMA, this Master Program, and this chapter. Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions of habitat and buffer areas shall be provided in compliance with the mitigation performance standards and requirements of these regulations. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.280 Fish and wildlife habitat – Required buffer areas.

A.    Buffer widths for fish and wildlife habitat areas shall be based on consideration of the following factors: species-specific recommendations of WDFW; recommendations contained in a habitat management plan submitted by a qualified professional; and the nature and intensity of land uses and activities occurring on the land adjacent to the site.

B.    Low-impact uses and activities that are consistent with the purpose and function of the habitat buffer and do not detract from its integrity may be permitted within the buffer depending on the sensitivity of the habitat area. Examples of uses and activities which may be permitted in appropriate cases include trails that are pervious, viewing platforms, low impact stormwater management facilities such as bioswales and other similar uses and activities; provided, that any impacts to the buffer resulting from such permitted facilities shall be fully mitigated.

C.    Standard Required Stream Buffer Widths. Buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the stream type, the risks associated with development and, in those circumstances permitted by these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity and site design proposed to be conducted on or near the stream area. Stream buffers shall be measured from the OHWM or the top of the bank, if the OHWM cannot be determined. Buffers shall be measured with rounded ends where streams enter or exit piped segments.

1.    The following buffers are established for streams based upon the DNR water typing system and further classification based on anadromous or nonanadromous fish presence for the Type F streams:

Table 20.240.280(1) 

	Stream Type	Standard Buffer Width (ft)

	Type S	150

	Type F-anadromous	115

	Type F-nonanadromous	75

	Type Np	65

	Type Ns	45

	Piped Stream Segments	10

2.    Increased Stream Buffer Widths. The recommended stream buffer widths shall be increased, as follows:

a.    When the qualified professional determines that the recommended width is insufficient to prevent habitat degradation and to protect the structure and functions of the habitat area;

b.    When the flood hazard area exceeds the recommended stream buffer width, the stream buffer area shall extend to the outer edge of the flood hazard area;

c.    When a channel migration zone is present, the stream buffer width shall be measured from the outer edge of the channel migration zone;

d.    When the habitat area is in an area of high blowdown potential, the stream buffer width shall be expanded an additional 50 feet on the windward side; or

e.    When the habitat area is within an erosion or landslide hazard area, or buffer, the stream buffer width shall be the recommended distance, or the erosion or landslide hazard area or buffer, whichever is greater.

3.    Stream Buffer Width Averaging with Enhancement. The Director may allow the recommended stream buffer width to be reduced in accordance with an approved critical area report and the best available science, on a case-by-case basis, by averaging buffer widths. Any allowance for averaging buffer widths shall only be granted based on the development and implementation of a buffer enhancement plan for areas of buffer degradation, consistent with the provisions in subsection (C)(4) of this section. Only those portions of the stream buffer existing within the project area or subject parcel shall be considered in the total buffer area for buffer averaging. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified professional demonstrates that:

a.    The width reduction and buffer enhancement plan provides evidence that the stream or habitat functions, including those of nonfish habitat and riparian wildlife, will be:

i.    Increased or maintained through plan implementation for those streams where existing buffer vegetation is generally intact native vegetation; or

ii.    Increased through plan implementation for those streams where existing buffer vegetation is inadequate to protect the functions and values of the stream;

b.    The total area contained in the buffer area of each stream on the development proposal site is not decreased after averaging;

c.    The recommended riparian habitat area width is not reduced by more than 25 percent in any one location; and

d.    The width reduction will not be located within another critical area or associated buffer.

4.    Stream Buffer Enhancement Measures. The measures determined most applicable and/or appropriate will be considered in buffer averaging requirements. These include but are not limited to:

a.    Removal of fish barriers to restore accessibility to fish.

b.    Enhancement of fish habitat using log structures incorporated as part of a fish habitat enhancement plan.

c.    Enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat structures that are likely to be used by wildlife, including wood duck houses, bat boxes, nesting platforms, snags, rootwads/stumps, birdhouses, and heron nesting areas.

d.    Additional enhancement measures may include:

i.    Planting native vegetation within the buffer area, especially vegetation that would increase value for fish and wildlife, increase stream bank or slope stability, improve water quality, or provide aesthetic/recreational value; or

ii.    Creation of a surface channel where a stream was previously underground, in a culvert or pipe. Surface channels that are “daylighted” shall be located within a buffer area and shall be designed with energy dissipating functions or channel roughness features such as meanders and rootwads to reduce future bank failures or nearby flooding; or

iii.    Removal or modification of existing stream culverts (such as at road crossings) to improve fish passage, stream habitat, and flow capabilities; or

iv.    Upgrading of retention/detention facilities or other drainage facilities beyond required levels.

20.240.300 Fish and wildlife habitat – Mitigation performance standards and requirements.

A.    Requirements for Mitigation. Where impacts cannot be avoided, and the applicant has exhausted all feasible design alternatives, the applicant or property owner shall seek to implement other appropriate mitigation actions in compliance with the intent, standards, and criteria of this section. Mitigation provisions shall be applied through the shoreline variance provisions in SMC 20.220.040, unless mitigated alterations are specifically allowed by the provisions of this subchapter. In an individual case, these actions may include consideration of alternative site plans and layouts, reductions in the density or scope of the proposal, and/or implementation of the performance standards listed in this section.

B.    Additional Requirements for Stream Mitigation. Significant adverse impacts to the shoreline ecological function of the stream area shall be mitigated. Mitigation actions shall be implemented in the preferred sequence: avoidance, minimization, restoration, and replacement. Proposals that include less preferred and/or compensatory mitigation shall demonstrate that:

1.    All feasible and reasonable measures will be taken to reduce impacts and losses to the stream, or to avoid impacts where avoidance is required by these regulations;

2.    The restored, created, or enhanced stream area or buffer will be available and persistent as the stream or buffer area it replaces; and

3.    No overall net loss will occur in the shoreline ecological functions of the stream.

C.    Compensating for Lost or Impacted Functions. Mitigation of alterations to fish and wildlife habitat shall achieve equivalent or greater shoreline ecological, biological, and hydrologic functions and shall include mitigation for adverse impacts upstream or downstream of the development proposal site on a per function basis. Mitigation shall be located on site except when demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an off-site location. A mitigation plan may include the following:

1.    Native vegetation planting plan;

2.    Retention, enhancement, or restoration plan of specific habitat features;

3.    Plans for control of nonnative invasive plant or wildlife species; and

4.    Stipulations for use of innovative, sustainable building practices.

D.    Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for the shoreline ecological function of fish and wildlife habitat shall be approached in the following order of preference:

1.    Protection. Mitigation measures that increase the protection of the identified fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas may include but are not limited to:

a.    Increased or enhanced buffers;

b.    Setbacks for permanent and temporary structures;

c.    Reduced project scope;

d.    Limitations on construction hours;

e.    Limitations on hours of operation; and/or

f.    Relocation of access.

2.    Restoration. Restoration of degraded habitat.

3.    Creation. Creation (establishment) of wildlife habitat on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species. This should be attempted only when the site conditions are conducive to the habitat type that is anticipated in the design.

4.    Enhancement. Enhancement of significantly degraded habitat in combination with restoration or creation. Enhancement alone will result in a loss of habitat acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions lost. Enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

5.    Preservation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk fish and wildlife habitat as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk fish and wildlife habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for habitat impacts when the following criteria are met:

a.    Habitat impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish, or other ESA-listed species;

b.    There is no net loss of habitat functions and values within the watershed or basin;

c.    The impact area is small (generally less than one-half acre) and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system; and

d.    All preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions and values from encroachment and degradation.

E.    Location and Timing of Stream Mitigation.

1.    Mitigation shall be provided on site, unless on-site mitigation is not scientifically feasible due to the physical features of the property. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that mitigation cannot be provided on site.

2.    When mitigation cannot be provided on site, mitigation shall be provided in the immediate vicinity of the permitted activity on property owned or controlled by the applicant, such as an easement, provided such mitigation is beneficial to the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area and associated resources. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain title to off-site mitigation areas. Mitigation may be considered on City-owned property, or on similar publicly owned property for which title is not available, through a City mitigation program if programmatic mitigation areas have been identified by the City.

3.    In-kind mitigation shall be provided, except when the applicant demonstrates and the City concurs that greater functional and habitat value can be achieved through out-of-kind mitigation.

4.    Only when it is determined by the City that subsections (B)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are inappropriate and impractical shall off-site, in-kind mitigation or off-site, out-of-kind mitigation be considered.

5.    When stream mitigation is permitted by this chapter on site or off site, the mitigation project shall occur near an adequate water supply (stream, ground water) with a hydrologic connection to the mitigation area to ensure successful development or restoration.

6.    Any agreed-upon mitigation proposal shall be completed prior to project construction, unless a phased schedule that assures completion concurrent with project construction has been approved by the City.

7.    Restored or created streams, where permitted by this chapter, shall be an equivalent or higher stream value or function than the altered stream.

F.    Performance Standards. The following mitigation measures shall be reflected in fish and wildlife habitat conservation area mitigation planning:

1.    The maintenance and protection of habitat functions and values shall be considered a priority in site planning and design;

2.    Buildings and structures shall be located in a manner that preserves and minimizes adverse impacts to important habitat areas. This may include clustering buildings and locating fences outside of habitat areas;

3.    Retained habitat shall be integrated into open space and landscaping;

4.    Where possible, habitat and vegetated open space shall be consolidated in contiguous blocks;

5.    Habitat shall be located contiguous to other habitat areas, open space, or landscaped areas, both on and off site, to contribute to a continuous system or corridor that provides connections to adjacent habitat areas;

6.    When planting is required, the following standards shall apply:

a.    Native species, indigenous to the region, shall be used in any landscaping of disturbed or undeveloped areas and in any enhancement of habitat or buffers;

b.    Plant selection shall be consistent with the existing or projected site conditions, including slope aspect, moisture, and shading;

c.    Plants should be commercially available or available from local sources;

d.    Plant species high in food and cover value for fish and wildlife shall be used;

e.    Mostly perennial species should be planted;

f.    Committing significant areas of the site to species that have questionable potential for successful establishment shall be avoided;

g.    Plant selection, densities, and placement of plants shall be determined by a qualified professional and shown on the design plans;

h.    Stockpiling soil and construction materials should be confined to upland areas and contract specifications should limit stockpiling of earthen materials to durations in accordance with City clearing and grading standards, unless otherwise approved by the City;

i.    Planting instructions shall be submitted which describe placement, diversity, and spacing of seeds, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, sprigs, plugs, and transplanted stock;

j.    Controlled release fertilizer shall be applied (if required) at the time of planting and afterward only as plant conditions warrant as determined during the monitoring process;

k.    An irrigation system shall be installed, if necessary, for the initial establishment period;

l.    The heterogeneity and structural diversity of vegetation shall be emphasized in landscaping; and

m.    Significant trees shall be preserved;

7.    All construction specifications and methods shall be approved by a qualified professional and the City; and

8.    Construction management shall be provided by a qualified professional. Ongoing work on site shall be inspected by the City.

G.    Mitigation Plan. Mitigation plans shall be submitted as part of the required critical area report consistent with the requirements of SMC 20.240.080, 20.240.082, and 20.240.290 and this section. When revegetation is required as part of the mitigation, then the mitigation plan shall meet the standards of SMC 20.240.350(H), excluding those standards that are wetland specific.

H.    Monitoring Program and Contingency Plan. A monitoring program shall be implemented by the applicant to determine the success of the mitigation project and any necessary corrective actions. This program shall determine if the original goals and objectives are being met. The monitoring program will be established consistent with the guidelines contained in SMC 20.240.082(D). (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

Subchapter 4.

Wetlands


20.240.310 Wetlands – Purpose.

A.    Wetlands help to maintain water quality; store and convey stormwater and floodwater; recharge ground water; provide important fish and wildlife habitat; and serve as areas for recreation, education, scientific study and aesthetic appreciation.

B.    The City’s overall goal shall be to achieve no net loss of wetlands. This goal shall be implemented through retention of the function, value, and acreage of wetlands within the City. Wetland buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates; reduce sediment, chemical nutrient, and toxic pollutants; provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures; provide habitat for wildlife; protect wetland resources from harmful intrusion; and generally preserve the ecological integrity of the wetland area.

C.    The primary purpose of the wetland regulations is to avoid detrimental wetland impacts and achieve a goal of no net loss of wetland function, value and acreage, and, where possible, enhance and restore wetlands. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.320 Wetlands – Designation and rating.

A.    Designation. All areas meeting the definition of a wetland and identification criteria as wetlands pursuant to SMC 20.240.322, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter.

B.    Rating. All wetlands shall be rated by a qualified professional according to the current Department of Ecology wetland rating system, as set forth in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington 2014 (Department of Ecology Publication No. 014-06-029, or as revised). Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the City, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities.

1.    Category I. Category I wetlands are those that represent unique or rare wetland types, are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands, are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime, or provide a high level of functions. The following types of wetlands are Category I:

a.    Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

b.    Wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR;

c.    Bogs;

d.    Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

e.    Wetlands in coastal lagoons; and

f.    Wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more based on functions).

2.    Category II. Category II wetlands are those that are difficult, though not impossible, to replace and provide high levels of some functions. The following types of wetlands are Category II:

a.    Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre;

b.    Interdunal wetlands larger than one acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands; and

c.    Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points).

3.    Category III. Category III wetlands are those with a moderate level of functions, generally have been disturbed in some ways, can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project, and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. The following types of wetlands are Category III:

a.    Wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); or

b.    Interdunal wetlands between 0.1 and one acre.

4.    Category IV. Category IV wetlands are those with the lowest levels of functions (scoring below 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be able to be replaced, or in some cases improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and also need to be protected.

C.    Illegal Modifications. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications or alterations. A wetland’s category shall be based on the premodification/alteration analysis of the wetland.

D.    At the time of adoption of the critical area amendments to this Master Program, through Ordinance No. 856, there were no identified Category I wetlands identified within the City. If this category of wetland is subsequently identified, any applicable standards may temporarily be used on an interim basis by the Director based on Washington State guidance on protection of the identified type of resource until such time as permanent shoreline regulations can be established. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.322 Wetlands – Mapping and delineation.

A.    Mapping. The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown in the wetland data layer maintained in the City geographic information system (GIS) and shown in Figure 20.230.080. In addition, the following maps and inventories are hereby adopted by reference as amended:

1.    City of Shoreline, Basin Characterization Reports and Stream and Wetland Inventory and Assessment, Tetra Tech (May 2004);

2.    City stormwater basin plans as completed and updated;

3.    Soils maps produced by the USDA National Resources Conservation Service; and

4.    The National Wetlands Inventory, produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

B.    Reference Only. The inventories and cited resources are to be used as a guide for the City, project applicants, and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new wetlands are identified or critical area reports are submitted for known wetlands. These inventories and cited resources are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation.

C.    Identification and Delineation. Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved Federal Wetland Delineation Manual and applicable regional supplements per WAC 173-22-035, as amended from time to time. The exact location of a wetland’s boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a qualified professional. Wetland delineations are valid for five years; after such date the Director shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary.

D.    Preassessment. To facilitate long-range planning using a landscape approach, the Director may identify and preassess wetlands using the rating system and establish appropriate wetland buffer widths for such wetlands. The Director will prepare maps of wetlands that have been preassessed in this manner. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.324 Wetlands – Development standards.

A.    Activities and uses shall be prohibited in wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this chapter.

B.    Activities Allowed in Wetlands. The activities listed below are allowed in wetlands pursuant to SMC 20.240.040, Allowed activities, and subject to applicable permit approvals. These activities do not require submission of a critical area report, except where such activities result in a net loss of the shoreline ecological function provided by a wetland or wetland buffer. These activities include:

1.    Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and/or other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing wetland.

2.    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

3.    Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a wetland, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column will be disturbed.

4.    Enhancement of a wetland through the select removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand labor and handheld equipment unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. Not more than 500 square feet of area may be cleared, as calculated cumulatively over one year, on private property without a permit. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and disposed of appropriately. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds or the King County Noxious Weed List shall be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.

5.    Permitted alteration to a legally constructed structure existing within a wetland or wetland buffer that does not increase the footprint of the development or hardscape or increase the impact to a wetland or wetland buffer, consistent with SMC 20.220.150.

C.    Category I Wetlands. Development activities and uses that result in alteration of Category I wetlands and their associated buffers shall be prohibited subject to the shoreline variance provisions of SMC 20.220.040.

D.    Category II, III and IV Wetlands. Development activities and uses that result in alteration of Category II, III and IV wetlands shall be prohibited subject to the shoreline variance provisions of SMC 20.220.040 and the following criteria:

1.    The basic project proposed cannot reasonably be accomplished on another site or sites in the general region while still successfully avoiding or resulting in less adverse impact on a wetland;

2.    All on-site alternative designs that would avoid or result in less adverse impact on a wetland or its buffer, such as a reduction to the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project, are not feasible; and

3.    Full compensation for the loss of acreage and functions and values of wetland and buffers due to unavoidable impacts shall be provided in compliance with the mitigation performance standards and requirements of this chapter.

E.    Subdivisions. The subdivision and/or short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers are subject to the following:

1.    Land that is located wholly within a wetland and/or its buffer may not be subdivided; and

2.    Land that is located partially within a wetland and/or its buffer may be subdivided; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is:

a.    Located outside of the wetland and its buffer; and

b.    Meets the minimum lot size requirements of SMC 20.50.020. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.330 Wetlands – Required buffer areas.

A.    Buffer Requirements. The standard buffer widths in Table 20.240.330(A)(1) have been established in accordance with the best available science. The buffer widths shall be determined based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as assigned by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington.

1.    The use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the mitigation measures in Table 20.240.330(A)(2), where applicable to the development type, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

2.    If an applicant chooses not to apply the appropriate mitigation measures in Table 20.240.330(A)(2), then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a 75-foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100-foot buffer without them.

3.    The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is a relatively intact native plant community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If the existing buffer is bare ground, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with nonnative or invasive species that do not perform needed functions, then the applicant shall either develop and implement a wetland buffer restoration or enhancement plan to maintain the standard width to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer shall be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

Table 20.240.330(A)(1) Wetland Buffer Requirements 

	Wetland Category	Buffer Width According to Habitat Score

	Habitat Score of 3 – 4	Habitat Score of 5	Habitat Score of 6 – 7	Habitat Score of 8 – 9

	Category I: Based on total score or forested	75 ft.	105 ft.	165 ft.	225 ft.

	Category I: Estuarine	150 ft. (no change based on habitat scores)

	Category II: Based on total score	75 ft.	105 ft.	165 ft.	225 ft.

	Category III (all)	60 ft.	105 ft.	165 ft.	225 ft.

	Category IV (all)	40 ft. (no change based on habitat scores)

	* These examples are not necessarily adequate for minimizing toxic runoff if threatened or endangered species are present at the site. Additional mitigation measures may be required based on recommendation of a qualified professional, third party review, or State agency recommendations.

4.    Increased Wetland Buffer Area Width. Buffer widths shall be increased, on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Director, when a larger buffer is necessary to protect the shoreline ecological functions provided by the wetland’s functions and values. This determination shall be supported by a critical area report, prepared by a qualified professional at the applicant’s expense, showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the wetland and the shoreline. The critical area report shall include, but not be limited to, the following criteria:

a.    The wetland is used by a plant or animal species listed by the Federal government or the State as endangered, threatened, candidate, sensitive, monitored, or documented priority species or habitats, or the wetland is essential or outstanding habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or

b.    The adjacent land has slopes greater than 15 percent and is susceptible to severe erosion, and erosion-control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or

c.    The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover. In lieu of increasing the buffer width where existing buffer vegetation is inadequate to protect the wetland functions and values, development and implementation of a wetland buffer restoration/enhancement plan in accordance with SMC 20.240.350 may be substituted.

5.    Buffer averaging to improve wetland functions and values may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

a.    The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or is a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower rated area;

b.    The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower functioning or less sensitive portion as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional;

c.    The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

d.    The buffer width is not reduced by more than 25 percent in any location.

6.    Buffer averaging may be permitted when all of the following are met:

a.    There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging;

b.    The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional;

c.    The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging; and

d.    The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either three-fourths of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

B.    Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

C.    Buffers on Mitigation Sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter. Buffers shall be based on the expected or target category of the proposed wetland mitigation site.

D.    Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. In the case of compensatory mitigation sites, removal of invasive nonnative weeds is required for the duration of the required monitoring period.

E.    Impacts to Buffers. Requirements for the compensation for impacts to buffers are outlined in SMC 20.240.350.

F.    Overlapping Critical Area Buffers. If buffers for two contiguous critical areas overlap (such as buffers for a stream and a wetland), the wider buffer applies.

G.    Allowed Wetland Buffer Uses. The following uses may be allowed within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this chapter, provided such uses are not prohibited by any other applicable law and such uses are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

1.    Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife.

2.    Passive Recreation. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:

a.    Walkways and trails; provided, that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. Pathways should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. Pathways should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings may be acceptable;

b.    Wildlife viewing structures.

3.    Educational and scientific research activities.

4.    Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way; provided, that the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or use of the facility or right-of-way.

5.    The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops, and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

6.    Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a buffer, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer boundary; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column is disturbed.

7.    Enhancement of a wetland through the select removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand labor and handheld equipment unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. Not more than 1,500 square feet of area may be cleared, as calculated cumulatively over one year, on private property without a permit. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and disposed of appropriately. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds or the King County Noxious Weed List shall be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.

8.    Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities are limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls, bioswales, and other low impact facilities consistent with the adopted stormwater manual. Stormwater management facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands. Facilities may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only; provided, that:

a.    No other location is feasible; and

b.    The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland.

9.    Nonconforming Uses or Structures. Repair and maintenance of nonconforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided such uses or structures do not increase the degree of nonconformity, consistent with SMC 20.220.150.

10.    Development Proposals within Physically Separated and Functionally Isolated Wetland Buffers. Consistent with the definition of “buffers” (SMC 20.20.012), areas that are functionally isolated and physically separated from wetland due to existing, legally established roadways, paved trails eight feet or more in width, or other legally established structures or paved areas eight feet or more in width that occur between the area in question and the wetland shall be considered physically isolated and functionally separated wetland buffers. Once determined by the Director, based on a submitted critical area report to be a physically separated and functionally isolated wetland buffer, development proposals shall be allowed in these areas.

H.    Signs and Fencing of Wetlands and Buffers.

1.    Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland buffer and the clearing limits identified by an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field with temporary “clearing limits” fencing in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur. The marking is subject to inspection by the Director prior to the commencement of permitted activities during the preconstruction meeting required under SMC 20.50.330(E). This temporary marking and fencing shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

2.    Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the Director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer, when recommended in a critical area report or otherwise required by the provisions of this chapter.

a.    Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post or another nontreated material of equal durability. Signs shall be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and shall be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The signs shall be worded consistent with the text specified in SMC 20.240.110 or with alternative language approved by the Director.

b.    The provisions of subsection (H)(2)(a) of this section may be modified as necessary to assure protection of sensitive features.

3.    Fencing. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. Permanent fencing shall be required at the outer edge of the critical area buffer under the following circumstances; provided, that the Director may waive this requirement:

a.    As part of any development proposal for subdivisions, short plats, multifamily, mixed use, and commercial development where the Director determines that such fencing is necessary to protect the functions of the critical area; provided, that breaks in permanent fencing may be allowed for access to permitted buffer uses (subsection G of this section);

b.    As part of development proposals for parks where the adjacent proposed use is active recreation and the Director determines that such fencing is necessary to protect the functions of the critical area;

c.    When buffer averaging is part of a development proposal;

d.    At the Director’s discretion to protect the values and functions of a critical area as demonstrated in a critical area report. If found to be necessary, the Director shall condition any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the habitat conservation area or buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the habitat conservation area; or

e.    The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland buffer when domestic grazing animals, only as allowed under SMC 20.40.240, are present or may be introduced on site. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.340 Wetlands – Critical area report requirements.

A.    Report Required. If the Director determines that the site of a proposed development includes, is likely to include, or is adjacent to a wetland, a wetland critical area report shall be required. Critical area report requirements for wetland areas are generally met through submission to the Director of one or more wetland critical area reports. In addition to the general critical area report requirements of SMC 20.240.080, critical area reports for wetlands shall meet the requirements of this section. Critical area reports for two or more types of critical areas shall meet the report requirements for each relevant type of critical area.

20.240.350 Wetlands – Compensatory mitigation performance standards and requirements.

A.    Requirements for Compensatory Mitigation.

1.    Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater shoreline ecological and biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1) (Department of Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, March 2006, or as revised).

2.    Mitigation ratios shall be consistent with subsection E of this section.

3.    Mitigation requirements may also be determined using the credit/debit tool described in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Operational Draft” (Department of Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, February 2011, or as revised) consistent with subsection E of this section.

B.    Compensating for Lost or Impacted Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the shoreline ecological functions and the wetland or wetland buffer functions and values affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions and values. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar shoreline ecological functions and wetland functions and values as those lost, except when either:

1.    The lost wetland provides minimal functions and values, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions and values or will provide functions and values shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

2.    Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions and values will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the City, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

C.    Preference of Mitigation Actions. Methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions and values shall be approached in the following order of preference:

1.    Restoration. Restoration of wetlands.

2.    Creation. Creation (establishment) of wetlands on disturbed upland sites, such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative species. This should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design.

3.    Enhancement. Enhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation. Enhancement alone will result in a loss of wetland acreage and is less effective at replacing the functions and values lost. Enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements.

4.    Preservation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met:

a.    Wetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish, or other ESA-listed species;

b.    There is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin;

c.    Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost;

d.    The impact area is small (generally less than one-half acre) and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system (Category III or IV wetland); and

e.    All preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation.

D.    Type and Location of Compensatory Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternative approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in kind and on site, or in kind and within the same stream reach, sub-basin, or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted). Compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration, except when all of the following apply:

1.    There are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Considerations should include:

a.    Anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation;

b.    Buffer conditions and proposed widths;

c.    Available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored; and

d.    Proposed flood storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

2.    Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland;

3.    Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin, unless watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the City and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; and

4.    The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape). Therefore, compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration, or enhancement of an atypical wetland. An atypical wetland refers to a compensation wetland (e.g., created or enhanced) that does not match the type of existing wetland that would be found in the geomorphic setting of the site (i.e., the water source(s) and hydroperiod proposed for the mitigation site are not typical for the geomorphic setting). Likewise, it should not provide exaggerated morphology or require a berm or other engineered structures to hold back water. For example, excavating a permanently inundated pond in an existing, seasonally saturated or inundated wetland is one example of an enhancement project that could result in an atypical wetland. Another example would be excavating depressions in an existing wetland on a slope, which would require the construction of berms to hold the water.

E.    Wetland Mitigation Ratios1.

Table 20.240.350(G). Wetland mitigation ratios apply when impacts to wetlands cannot be avoided or are otherwise allowed consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 

	Category and Type of Wetland2	Creation or Reestablishment (Area – in square feet)	Rehabilitation (Area – in square feet)	Enhancement (Area – in square feet)

	Category I: Based on total score for functions	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category I: Mature forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I: Estuarine	Case-by-case	6:1	Case-by-case

	Category II: Based on total score for functions	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category III (all)	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category IV (all)	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

	1 Ratios for rehabilitation and enhancement may be reduced when combined with 1:1 replacement through creation or reestablishment. See Table 1a or 1b, Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance – Version 1 (Department of Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a, March 2006, or as revised).

2 Category and rating of wetland as determined consistent with SMC 20.240.320(B).

F.    Buffer Mitigation Ratios. Impacts to buffers shall be mitigated at a 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development.

G.    Mitigation Performance Standards. The performance standards in this section shall be incorporated into mitigation plans submitted to the City for impacts to wetlands. The following performance standards shall apply to any mitigations proposed within Category I, II, III and IV wetlands and their buffers. Modifications to these performance standards consistent with the guidance in Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1) (Department of Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, March 2006, or as revised) may be considered for approval by the Director as alternatives to the following standards:

1.    Plants indigenous to the region (not introduced or foreign species) shall be used.

2.    Plant selection shall be consistent with the existing or projected hydrologic regime, including base water levels and stormwater event fluctuations.

3.    Plants should be commercially available or available from local sources.

4.    Plant species high in food and cover value for fish and wildlife shall be used.

5.    Mostly perennial species should be planted.

6.    Committing significant areas of the site to species that have questionable potential for successful establishment shall be avoided.

b.    The grade or slope that water flows through the wetland shall not exceed six percent.

c.    Slopes within the wetland basin and the buffer zone shall not be steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical).

d.    The wetland (excluding the buffer area) should not contain more than 60 percent open water as measured at the seasonal high water mark.

9.    Substrate should consist of a minimum of one foot, in depth, of clean (uncontaminated with chemicals or solid/hazardous wastes) inorganic/organic materials.

10.    Planting densities and placement of plants should be determined by a qualified professional and shown on the design plans.

11.    The planting plan shall be approved by the City.

12.    Stockpiling soil and construction materials should be confined to upland areas and contract specifications should limit stockpiling of earthen materials to durations in accordance with City clearing and grading standards, unless otherwise approved by the City.

13.    Planting instructions shall be submitted that describe placement, diversity, and spacing of seeds, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, sprigs, plugs, and transplanted stock.

14.    Controlled release fertilizer shall be applied (if required) at the time of planting and afterward only as plant conditions warrant as determined during the monitoring process.

15.    An irrigation system shall be installed, if necessary, for the initial establishment period.

16.    All construction specifications and methods shall be approved by a qualified professional and the City.

17.    Construction management shall be provided by a qualified professional. Ongoing work on site shall be inspected by the City.

H.    Compensatory Mitigation Plan. When a project involves wetland and/or buffer impacts, a compensatory mitigation plan shall be included as part of the required critical area report. Compensatory wetland mitigation plans shall meet the minimum requirements of SMC 20.240.082 and demonstrate compliance with SMC 20.240.053. Full guidance can be found in Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1) (Department of Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, March 2006, or as revised). The mitigation plan shall meet the following additional standards:

1.    Description of the existing wetland and buffer areas proposed to be impacted. Include acreage (or square footage), water regime, vegetation, soils, landscape position, surrounding land uses, and functions. Also describe impacts in terms of acreage by Cowardin classification, hydrogeomorphic classification, and wetland rating, based on wetland ratings (SMC 20.240.320(B));

2.    Description of the compensatory mitigation site, including location and rationale for selection. Include an assessment of existing conditions: acreage (or square footage) of wetlands and uplands, water regime, sources of water, vegetation, soils, landscape position, surrounding land uses, and functions. Estimate future conditions in this location if the compensation actions are not undertaken (i.e., how would this site progress through natural succession);

3.    A description of the proposed actions for compensation of wetland and upland areas affected by the project. Include overall goals of the proposed mitigation, including a description of the targeted functions, hydrogeomorphic classification, and categories of wetlands;

(Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

Subchapter 5.

Shoreline Flood Hazard Areas


20.240.360 Floodplain management.

The following policies and regulations must be factored into decisions regarding all flood management planning and development within that portion of the 100-year floodplain that falls within Shoreline’s shoreline jurisdiction (within 200 feet of OHWM).

Floodplain management involves actions taken with the primary purpose of preventing or mitigating damage due to flooding. Floodplain management can involve planning and zoning to control development, either to reduce risks to human life and property, or to prevent development from contributing to the severity of flooding. Floodplain management can also address the design of developments to reduce flood damage and the construction of flood controls, such as dikes, dams, engineered floodways, and bioengineering.

A.    Policy.

1.    Flood management planning should be undertaken in a coordinated manner among affected property owners and public agencies and should consider the entire coastal system. This planning should consider off-site impacts such as erosion, accretion, and/or flood damage that might occur if shore protection structures are constructed.

2.    Nonstructural control solutions are preferred over structural flood control devices, and should be used wherever possible when control devices are needed. Nonstructural controls include such actions as prohibiting or limiting development in areas that are historically flooded or limiting increases in peak flow runoff from new upland development. Structural solutions to reduce shoreline damage should be allowed only after it is demonstrated that nonstructural solutions would not be able to reduce the damage.

3.    Substantial stream channel modification, realignment, and straightening should be discouraged as a means of flood protection.

4.    Where possible, public access should be integrated into the design of publicly financed flood management facilities. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.370 Flood hazard – Description and purpose.

A.    A flood hazard area consists of the special flood hazard areas and protected areas as defined in Chapter 13.12 SMC, Floodplain Management, which comprise the regulatory floodplain.

B.    It is the purpose of Chapter 13.12 SMC regulations to ensure that the City meets the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and maintains the City as an eligible community for Federal flood insurance benefits. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.380 Flood hazard – Development limitations.

Development occurring within the 100-year floodplain designations of the current Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for King County as identified in SMC 13.12.300, which is also located in the shoreline jurisdiction, shall be subject to the regulatory and permit authorities of both this Master Program and Chapter 13.12 SMC. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).

Subchapter 6.

Aquifer Recharge Areas


20.240.420 Aquifer recharge – Description and purpose.

A.    Aquifer recharge areas consist of areas that provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream discharge during periods of low flow, as defined in Chapter 20.20 SMC.

B.    The primary purpose of aquifer recharge area regulations is to protect aquifer recharge areas by providing for regulation of land use activities that pose a risk of potential aquifer contamination and to minimize impacts through the application of strict performance standards. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.430 Aquifer recharge – Designation and classification.

A.    Aquifer recharge areas shall be designated and classified based on the soil and ground water conditions and risks to surface water during periods of low hydrology. Classification depends on the combined effects of hydrogeological susceptibility to contamination and contaminant loading potential, and includes upland areas underlain by soils consisting largely of silt, clay or glacial till, upland areas underlain by soils consisting largely of sand and gravel, wellhead protection areas, and areas underlain by soils consisting largely of sand and gravel in which there is a predominantly downward or lateral component to ground water flow.

B.    At the time of adoption of the amendments to the critical areas of this Master Program, through Ordinance No. 856, there were no identified critical aquifer recharge areas within the city. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.440 Aquifer recharge – Alteration.

Subject to the required permits, the following land uses and activities shall require implementation of best management practices (BMPs) as established by the Department of Ecology:

A.    Land uses and activities that involve the use, storage, transport, or disposal of significant quantities of chemicals, substances, or materials that are toxic, dangerous, or hazardous, as those terms are defined by State and Federal regulations;

B.    On-site community sewage disposal systems;

C.    Underground storage of chemicals;

D.    Petroleum pipelines;

E.    Solid waste landfills; and/or

F.    Stormwater management, including infiltration, and ground water recharge. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).


20.240.450 Aquifer recharge – Performance standards and requirements.

Any uses or activities that seek to be located in an aquifer recharge area, as defined within this subchapter, which involve the use, storage, transport, or disposal of significant quantities of chemicals, substances, or materials that are toxic, dangerous, or hazardous, as those terms are defined by State and Federal regulations, shall comply with the following additional standards:

A.    Underground storage of chemicals, substances or materials that are toxic, hazardous, or dangerous is discouraged.

B.    Any chemicals, substances or materials that are toxic, hazardous, or dangerous shall be segregated and stored in receptacles or containers that meet State and Federal standards.

C.    Storage containers shall be located in a designated, secured area that is paved and able to contain leaks and spills, and shall be surrounded by a containment dike.

D.    Secondary containment devices shall be constructed around storage areas to retard the spread of any spills and a monitoring system should be implemented.

E.    A written operations plan shall be developed, including procedures for loading/unloading liquids and for training of employees in proper materials handling.

F.    An emergency response/spill clean-up plan shall be prepared and employees properly trained to react to accidental spills.

G.    Any aboveground storage tanks shall be located within a diked containment area on an impervious surface. The tanks shall include overfill protection systems and positive controls on outlets to prevent uncontrolled discharges.

H.    Development should be clustered and impervious surfaces limited where possible.

I.    No waste liquids or chemicals of any kind shall be discharged to storm sewers.

J.    All development shall implement best management practices (BMPs) for water quality, as approved by the City, including the standards contained within the adopted stormwater manual, such as biofiltration swales and use of oil-water separators, and BMPs appropriate to the particular use proposed. (Ord. 856 § 2 (Exh. B), 2019).
