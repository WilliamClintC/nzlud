PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Portsmouth, Virginia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code, as supplemented through January 24, 2006. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code and the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 8 and 9, it will be designated as Chapter 8.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

The members of the commission shall devote due time and attention to the performance of their duties. The commission shall conduct its meetings in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order, except to the extent modified by the commission.  
Sec. 11.02. - Functions and duties. 
The authority, powers, and responsibilities of the commission shall apply to, and be limited to, the police department and the fire department. The members and employees of said departments may be referred to herein as the "civil service." 
a.  It shall be the duty of the commission to make suitable rules and regulations not inconsistent with applicable law and this chapter. The rules and regulations shall provide in detail the manner in which examinations may be held, and appointments, promotions, transfers, reinstatements, demotions, suspensions and discharges shall be made. The rules and regulations and any amendments thereof shall be made available for free public distribution. 
b.  All tests shall be practical, and shall consist only of subjects which will fairly determine the capacity of persons examined to perform duties of the position to which appointment is to be made, and may include tests of physical fitness and of manual skill. 
c.  The commission may make investigations concerning and report upon all matters touching the enforcement and effect of this chapter, and the rules and regulations prescribed hereunder; inspect all institutions, departments, offices, places, positions and employments affected hereby, and ascertain whether this chapter and all rules and regulations are being obeyed. Investigations may be made by the entire commission or by a single commissioner designated by the commission for such purpose. 
d.  In the course of an investigation or hearing, the commission shall have the power to administer oaths, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, documents and accounts appertaining to the investigation. The commission may also cause the depositions of witnesses residing within or without the city to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like depositions in civil actions. The oaths administered and the subpoenas issued hereunder shall have the same force and effect as the oaths administered by a circuit court judge; and the failure upon the part of any person so subpoenaed to comply with the provisions of this section may be enforced by equitable relief. 
e.  All hearings and investigations before the commission shall be governed by this chapter and by the rules and practices and procedures to be adopted by the commission, and in the conduct thereof the commission shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence. No informality in any proceeding or hearing, or in the manner of taking testimony before the commission, shall invalidate any order, decision, rule or regulation made, approved or confirmed by the commission. 
f.  The commission shall hear and determine appeals or complaints from a covered employee's removal, suspension, demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary action. 
g.  The commission shall provide for, formulate and hold competitive tests devised in accordance with applicable laws to determine the relative qualifications of persons who seek employment in any class or position and as a result thereof establish eligibility lists for the various classes of positions, and to provide that persons laid off because of curtailment of expenditures, reduction in force, and for like causes, head the list in the order of their seniority, to the end that they shall be the first to be reemployed. 
h.  The commission shall certify to the appointing authority, upon written request, the names of the persons on the eligibility list for the class for which one (1) or more vacant positions exist, and if there is no such list, to establish a provisional or temporary appointment list of the class. No temporary or provisional appointment shall continue for a period longer than four (4) months; nor shall any person receive more than one (1) provisional appointment or serve more than four (4) months as a provisional appointee in any fiscal year. 
i.  The commission shall keep such records as may be necessary for the proper administration of its responsibilities. 
j.  The commission shall make such reports as the city council may require; provided, however, it shall be the duty of the commission to report at least annually to the council showing its actions, the rules in force, the practical effects thereof, and any suggestions it may have for the improvement of the civil service. 
k.  The commission shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, if necessary to implement any of its powers, rights, or responsibilities as set forth hereunder. The power to seek equitable relief shall extend to, but shall not be limited to, failure of any person to honor a subpoena or a subpoena duces tecum duly issued by or on behalf of the commission; the failure to comply with a lawful direction of the commission in the conduct of an investigation, hearing, or appeal; and failure to provide the level of administrative or financial support to which the commission is entitled under this chapter. In any such proceeding, the commission shall be represented by the city attorney; but if the city attorney is unable to provide such representation for any reason, then by legal counsel retained by the commission.  
Sec. 11.03. - Annual appropriation. 
There is hereby appropriated out of the general funds an appropriation to carry out the purposes of this chapter, which appropriation shall be one-fourth of one (¼) percent of the total payroll of those included under the jurisdiction and scope of this chapter; provided, however, that if the council shall make an appropriation for the support of the commission exceeding that amount, this section shall not be operative for said year but otherwise shall be in full force and effect.  
Sec. 11.04. - Rooms, supplies, and clerical assistance. 
The city council or the city manager shall provide the commission with suitable and convenient rooms and cause the same to be furnished, heated and lighted and supplied with all office supplies and equipment necessary to carry on the business of the commission, and to provide such clerical assistance as may be necessary.  
Sec. 11.05. - Chief and deputy chiefs: standards for appointments and promotions. 
The provisions of this chapter dealing with eligibility lists and the right to appeal discipline shall not apply to any department chief or deputy department chief.  
Sec. 11.06. - Appointments to vacant positions. 
In general, all appointments to and promotions in the police and fire departments shall be made solely on merit, efficiency and fitness, which shall be ascertained by competitive and impartial means. 
a.  Whenever a position in the classified service becomes vacant, the appointing authority, if it desires to fill the vacancy, shall request from the commission the names of persons eligible for appointment thereto. The commission shall certify the names on the eligibility list for the class to which the vacant position has been allocated that are willing to accept employment. The appointing authority may then appoint a certified person to the vacant position. 
b.  Whenever request is made, or whenever a position is held by a temporary appointee and an eligibility list for the class of such position exists, the commission shall certify the names of the persons eligible for appointment to the appointing authority, who may then appoint a certified person to the position. 
c.  To enable the appointing authority to exercise a choice in the filling of positions, no appointment, employment, or promotion in any position in the classified service shall be deemed complete until after the expiration of a period of not more than one year probationary service, during which the appointing authority may terminate the employment of the person, if during the performance test thus afforded, upon observations or considerations of the performance of duty, the appointing authority deems the employee unfit or unsatisfactory for service in the department. Whereupon the appointing authority shall designate a person or persons certified for such position and such person or persons shall likewise enter upon said duties until some person is found who is deemed fit for appointment, employment or promotion for the probationary period required.  
Sec. 11.07. - Tenure of office; discharge. 
The tenure of everyone holding office, place, position or employment under the civil service provisions of this chapter, shall be only during good behavior and efficient performance of duty. Any such person may be removed, discharged, suspended without pay, or reduced in rank, or deprived of vacation privileges or other privileges for any of the following reasons: 
a.  Incompetent or inefficient performance of duty or inattention to or dereliction of duty; 
b.  Insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public or a fellow employee or any other act of omission or commission of similar nature tending directly to discredit or injure the public service or to jeopardize the effective functioning of the service, or any willful violations of the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations to be adopted hereunder; 
c.  Mental or physical unfitness for the position which the employee holds; 
d.  Any conduct which is dishonest, deceitful, immoral or declared criminal by statute or common law, regardless of whether a criminal conviction is obtained; 
e.  Drunkenness or use of intoxicating liquors, narcotics or any other dangerous drug, liquid or preparation to such extent that the use thereof interferes with the efficiency or mental or physical fitness of the employee, or which precludes the employee from properly performing the functions and duties of his or her position; 
f.  Conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or a pattern of misconduct as manifested by a series of convictions of misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude; 
g.  Failure to report to an appropriate superior authority administrative errors, incompetence, misconduct, inefficiency, neglect of duty, or any other form of misconduct or negligence of which the employee has knowledge; 
h.  Failure of a supervisory employee or commanding officer to take appropriate corrective action with regard to such employees under his supervision or command as may be guilty of any form of neglect of duty or misconduct where the supervisor or commanding officer knows or should have known of such derelictions; 
i.  Failure to achieve professional progress and advancement in accordance with reasonable and definitive criteria established by the civil service commission and set forth in its rules and regulations; provided, however, that such failure must be a personal failure of the employee and not one directly caused by conditions beyond the control of the employee; provided, further, that no person shall be disciplined under this rule unless and until he or she is given adequate written notice of his deficiencies and a reasonable time to correct them; and 
j.  Violation of any applicable law or regulation dealing with standards of conduct.  
Sec. 11.08. - Disciplinary procedure. 
a.  No full-time, nonprobationary employee in the civil service shall be removed, suspended, demoted or discharged except for cause, as set forth in section 11.07, stated in writing by the appointing authority. The employee may appeal such disciplinary action to the commission within ten days, unless a different and legally authorized appeal or grievance procedure is chosen by the employee. A civil service employee may select only one appeal or grievance procedure and may not change procedures once the initial election is made. The commission shall thereafter conduct a hearing and receive such testimony from witnesses and other evidence as may be relevant to the matter. Thereafter, the commission shall have general authority to affirm, reverse, or modify the disciplinary action that has been appealed, based on the evidence and the law. 
b.  All appeal hearings conducted by the commission pursuant to this section shall be open to the public, after reasonable notice to the accused of the time and place of such hearing. At any such appeal hearing the accused may appear in person and by counsel and may present a defense. The commission shall retain the power to sequester witnesses during a public appeal hearing. However, if the appellant requests that the appeal hearing be conducted in private, the commission shall have discretion to grant that request.  
Sec. 11.09. - Appeals from decisions of the civil service commission. 
An employee or appointing authority may appeal a decision of the commission involving discipline. The appeal shall be initiated by written notice filed with the commission stating the grounds for appeal. The commission shall file with the court a certified record of the proceedings, including a hearing transcript, within twenty (20) days of receipt of the appeal. The court shall then hear and review the appeal in a summary manner upon the commission's written record, plus such legal briefs and oral argument as the court deems proper. After a hearing, the court may affirm, modify or reverse the commission's decision. The court's review will be limited to whether the appointing authority's actions were in good faith and for cause, and the decision of the commission shall be affirmed unless the court concludes, based on the record and the law, that the decision was not in good faith or was not for cause.  
Sec. 11.10. - Political services disregarded and prohibited; other discriminatory actions prohibited. 
a.  No person holding any office, place, position or employment subject to the civil service is under any obligation to contribute to any political fund or to render any political service to any person or party whatsoever, and no person shall be removed, reduced in grade or salary, or otherwise prejudiced for refusing to do so. 
b.  No public officer whether elected or appointed shall discharge, promote, demote or in any manner change the official rank, employment or compensation of any person under the civil service, or promise or threaten to do so, for giving or withholding or neglecting to make any contribution of money or services, or any other valuable thing, for any political purpose. 
c.  No person shall be appointed to or promoted to, suspended from, demoted, removed or discharged from any position in the classified service, or in any way favored or discriminated against with respect to employment in the civil service because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or political affiliations. 
d.  No person shall seek or attempt to use any political endorsement in connection with any appointment to a position in the classified service. No recommendation for any person who applies for office or position in the classified service, or for examination under the provisions of this chapter, except, as to character, and, in the case of former employers, as to ability, shall be considered by the commission, director, or the appointing authority in giving any examination, appointment, promotion or reinstatement under this chapter. 
e.  No person shall use, or promise to use, directly or indirectly, any official authority or influence, whether possessed or anticipated, to secure or attempt to secure for any person an appointment or advantage in appointment to a position in the classified service, or an increase in pay or other advantage in employment in any such position, for the purpose of influencing the vote or political action of any person, or for any consideration. 
f.  No person in the classified service, and no member of the commission, shall, directly or indirectly, pay or promise to pay any assessment, subscription, or contribution for any political organization or purpose, or solicit or take part in soliciting, or receive any such assessment, subscription or contribution. No person shall solicit any such assessment, subscription or contribution of any employee in the classified service. 
g.  No person in the classified service, and no member of the commission shall take any active part in the management of any political party or in any political campaign; provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or prevent any such officer or employee from exercising the rights of a citizen privately to express an opinion or from enjoying entire freedom from all interference in casting a vote, or from seeking or accepting election or appointment to public office.

A petition, which complies with the requirements of this chapter as to form, number of signers, and manner of execution, shall be accepted as prima facie sufficient. The circuit court of the City of Portsmouth shall have summary jurisdiction upon complaint of an elector to determine the sufficiency of the petition and the genuineness of the signatures thereon, and the qualifications of the electors signing the same, and may make such order in the matter as justice may require. Such proceedings shall be instituted within ten (10) days after presentation of the petition, and the burden of proof shall be on the complainant.  
Sec. 12.09. - Recall of elective officers.

b.  A petition signed by electors equal in number to at least thirty (30) percent of the electors of the city voting for governor in the last preceding gubernatorial election, and demanding the election of a successor of the officer sought to be removed, shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court. The petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds upon which the election of a successor is sought. Such petition may be filed at any time after one year has elapsed since the beginning of the term of the official sought to be removed. Each signer shall include the number and street of his or her residence in the city, and the date he or she signed the petition. Such petition may be in the form of separate papers, but each separate paper to which signatures are appended shall contain at the top thereof the original petition or a duplicate statement thereof, and when bound together and offered for filing, such separate papers shall be deemed to constitute one petition with respect to the election of the successor of the officer or officers named therein. One (1) of the signers of such petition shall make oath before a proper official that the statements made therein are true, as he or she believes, and upon such separate paper, the circulator of the petition to which signatures are appended shall make oath that each signature to such paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, and that it was signed in his or her presence. 
c.  If it appears that the petition is signed by the requisite percentage of electors, the same shall be accepted as prima facie regular and sufficient, but it shall be subject to summary review in the same manner as provided in section 12.08 of this chapter. 
d.  If the petition is sufficient, and if the officer or officers whose removal is sought do not resign within five (5) days after the sufficiency of the petition has been determined by a judge of the Circuit Court, a judge thereof shall thereupon order and fix a day for holding an election for the selection of a successor to each officer named in said petition, which election shall be held not fewer than thirty (30) nor more than forty (40) days from the presentation of the petition or from the making of any court order thereon. The judge shall cause publication of notice and all arrangements to be made for holding such election and the same shall be conducted and the result thereof returned and declared in all respects as in other special elections, in so far as possible. 
e.  A nomination of a candidate to succeed each officer sought to be removed shall be made without the intervention of a primary election, by filing with the clerk of the circuit court at least ten days prior to such special election, a petition proposing a person for such office, signed by the electors equal in number to at least thirty (30) percent of the electors of the city voting for governor in the last preceding gubernatorial election. 
f.  The ballots at such election shall conform to the following requirements: with respect to each officer whose removal is sought, the question shall be submitted: Shall (name of officer) be removed from the office (name of office) by recall? Beneath the aforesaid question shall be placed the names of the candidates to fill the vacancy. The name of the officer whose removal is sought shall not appear on the ballot as a candidate to succeed him/herself. 
g.  In any such election, if a majority of the votes cast on the question of removal be affirmative, the candidate receiving the highest number of the votes cast shall be declared elected and if more than one (1) council member is removed at such election, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, equal in number to the number of council members removed, shall be declared elected. The officer whose removal is sought shall thereupon be deemed removed from office upon the announcement of the official canvass of the election. The successor of any officer so removed shall hold office during the unexpired term of his predecessor. In case the person or persons receiving the highest number of votes shall fail to qualify within ten (10) days after receiving notification of election, the office shall be deemed vacant. The question of the removal of any officer shall not be submitted to the electors a second time during the same term of office, until after the expiration of one (1) year from the determination of the first application for removal. The method of removal herein provided is cumulative and additional to such other methods as may be provided by law.

(b)  It shall be unlawful to fail to provide any animal with adequate space. "Adequate space" means sufficient space to allow each animal to (i) easily stand, sit, lie, turn about, and make all other normal body movements in a comfortable, normal position for the animal and (ii) interact safely with other animals in the enclosure.

An animal shall be deemed "unconfined" if such animal is not securely confined indoors or confined in a securely enclosed and locked pen or run area upon the premises of such person. Such pen or run area must also have either sides six feet high or a secure top. If the pen or structure has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than one foot. 
(b)  In the event that an animal control officer has probable cause to believe that a vicious or destructive animal is being harbored or cared for in violation of subsection (a) of this section, the animal control officer may seize and impound the animal pending trial.

An animal control officer may again impound the animal pending disposition of the original charge upon his determination that the owner or custodian has again failed to confine the animal as required under subsection (a) of this section. 
(d)  Any animal not redeemed within five days of disposition of the original charge by the court shall be disposed of other than by sale or transfer by the Portsmouth Humane Society, Inc. or other entity serving as the city's public animal shelter.

Sec. 4-33.1. - Authority to control dangerous or vicious dogs. 
(a)  As used in this section: 
Dangerous dog means a canine or canine crossbreed which has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a person or companion animal, other than a dog, or killed a companion animal. However, when a dog attacks or bites another dog, the attacking or biting dog shall not be deemed dangerous: (i) if no serious physical injury as determined by a licensed veterinarian has occurred to the other dog as a result of the attack or bite, or (ii) both dogs are owned by the same person. No dog shall be found to be a dangerous dog as a result of biting, attacking or inflicting injury on another dog while engaged with an owner or custodian as part of lawful hunting or participating in an organized, lawful dog handling event. 
Vicious dog means a canine or canine crossbreed which has: (i) killed a person; (ii) inflicted serious injury to a person, including multiple bites, serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health, or serious impairment of a bodily function; or (iii) continued to exhibit the behavior which resulted in a previous finding by a court that it is a dangerous dog, provided that its owner has been given notice of that finding. 
(b)  Any animal control officer who has reason to believe that a canine or canine crossbreed within his jurisdiction is a dangerous dog or vicious dog shall apply to a magistrate of the city for the issuance of a summons requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before the general district court at a specified time. The summons shall advise the owner of the nature of the proceeding and the matters at issue. The animal control officer or owner shall confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian or harborer of the animal to produce the animal. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a dangerous dog, the court shall order the animal's owner to comply with the provisions of this section. If, after hearing the evidence, the court finds that the animal is a vicious dog, the court shall order the animal euthanized in accordance with the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 3.2-6562, which said section is incorporated herein by reference, it being the intent of this section that any amendment of the aforementioned section by the legislature of the state shall be deemed to be incorporated herein upon the effective date of such legislation. 
(c)  No canine or canine crossbreed shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog solely because it is a particular breed, nor shall the city council prohibit the ownership of a particular breed of canine or canine crossbreed. No animal shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person who was: (i) committing, at the time, a crime upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian, (ii) committing, at the time, a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian, or (iii) provoking, tormenting, or physically abusing the animal, or can be shown to have repeatedly provoked, tormented, abused or assaulted the animal at other times. No police dog which was engaged in the performance of its duties as such at the time of the acts complained of shall be found to be dangerous dog or a vicious dog. No animal which, at the time of acts complained of, was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, or its owner or owner's property, shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog. 
(d)  The owner of any animal found by the court to be a dangerous dog shall, within 45 days of such finding, obtain a dangerous dog registration certificate from the city treasurer for a fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code in addition to other fees that may be authorized by law. The city treasurer's office shall also provide the owner with a uniformly designed tag which identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall affix the tag to the animal's collar and ensure that the animal wears the collar and tag at all times. All certificates obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be updated and renewed by January 31 of each calendar year for a renewal fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code and in the same manner as the initial certificate was obtained. 
(e)  All certificates or renewals thereof required to be obtained under this section shall only be issued to persons 18 years of age or older who present satisfactory evidence: (i) of the animal's current rabies vaccination, if applicable, and (ii) that the animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure or is and will be confined inside the owner's residence or is and will be muzzled and confined in the owner's fenced-in yard until the proper enclosure is constructed. In addition, owners who apply for certificates or renewals thereof under this section shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof unless they present satisfactory evidence that: (i) they possess a current city dog license, (ii) their residence is and will continue to be posted with clearly visible signs warning both minors and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on the property, (iii) the animal has been permanently identified by means of a tattoo on the inside thigh or by electronic implantation, (iv) will cause the animal to be spayed or neutered, and (v) will purchase liability insurance coverage of at least $100,000.00. 
(f)  While on the property of its owner, an animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall be confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked structure of sufficient height not less than six feet with a secure top and designed to prevent its escape or direct contact with or entry by minors, adults or other animals. The structure shall be designed to provide the animal with all the elements of basic animal care as enumerated in Code of Virginia, § 3.2-6503. When off its owner's property, an animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall be kept on a leash and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the animal or interfere with the animal's vision or respiration, but so as to prevent it from biting a person or another animal. Such muzzle shall be approved by the animal control officer. 
(g)  If the owner of an animal found by the court to be a dangerous dog is a minor, the custodial parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for complying with all requirements of this section. 
(h)  After an animal has been found by the court to be a dangerous dog, the animal's owner shall immediately, upon learning of same, notify the local animal control authority if the animal: (i) is loose or unconfined; (ii) bites a person or attacks another animal; (iii) is sold, given away or dies; or (iv) has been moved to a different address. If the animal has been sold or given away, the former owner or custodian shall provide the new owner's or custodian's name, address, and telephone number to the local animal control authority. 
(i)  The owner of any animal which has been found by a court to be a dangerous dog who willfully fails to comply with the requirements of this section shall be guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor, and the dog may be ordered to be seized and euthanized by the court. 
(j)  All fees collected pursuant to this section, less the cost incurred by the animal control authority in producing and distributing the certificates and tags required by this section, shall be paid into a special dedicated fund in the treasury of the city for the purpose of paying the expenses and any training course required under Code of Virginia, § 3.2-6556, which section is incorporated herein by reference, it being the intent of this section that any amendment to the aforementioned section by the legislature of the state shall be deemed to be incorporated herein upon the effective date of such legislation.

State Law reference Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, Code of Virginia, § 10.1-2100 et seq. 
 
Sec. 9.1-1. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries is one of the most important and productive estuarine systems in the world, providing economic and social benefits to the citizens of the City of Portsmouth and the Commonwealth of Virginia. The health of the Bay is vital to maintaining the city's economy and the welfare of its citizens. 
(b)  The Chesapeake Bay waters have been degraded significantly by many sources of pollution, including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and development. Existing high quality waters are worthy of protection from degradation to guard against further pollution. Certain lands that are proximate to shorelines have intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform. Other lands have severe development constraints from flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. With proper management, they offer significant ecological benefits by providing water quality maintenance and pollution control, as well as flood and shoreline erosion control. These lands together, designated by the city council as Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas (hereinafter "CBPAs"), need to be protected from destruction and damage in order to protect the quality of water in the Bay and consequently the quality of life in the City of Portsmouth and the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
(Code 1988, § 9.1-1; Ord. No. 2004-02, § 1, 1-13-2004)

(a)  This chapter is enacted to implement the requirements of Code of Virginia, § 10.1-2100 et seq., the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. The intent of the city council and the purpose of the overlay district is to: 
(1)  Protect existing high quality state waters; 
(2)  Restore all other state waters to a condition or quality that will permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth of all aquatic life, including game fish, which might reasonably be expected to inhabit them; 
(3)  Safeguard the clean waters of the commonwealth from pollution; 
(4)  Prevent any increase in pollution; 
(5)  Reduce existing pollution; and 
(6)  Promote water resource conservation in order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future citizens of the city.

(c)  Final delineation shown on CBPA map. When a delineation of a CBPA has been approved or established by the director of planning, the CBPA Map shall be amended to reflect that delineation. 
(Code 1988, § 9.1-9; Ord. No. 2004-02, § 1, 1-13-2004; Ord. No. 2005-04, § 2, 1-11-2005; Ord. No. 2009-88, § 1, 8-25-2009)  
Sec. 9.1-10. - Performance standards. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The performance standards establish the means to minimize erosion and sedimentation potential, reduce land application of nutrients and toxics, and maximize rainwater infiltration. Natural groundcover, especially woody vegetation, is most effective in holding soil in place and preventing site erosion. Indigenous vegetation, with its adaptability to local conditions without the use of harmful fertilizers or pesticides, filters stormwater runoff. Minimizing impervious cover enhances rainwater infiltration and effectively reduces stormwater runoff potential. The purpose and intent of these requirements are also to implement the following objectives: prevent a net increase in nonpoint source pollution from new development; achieve a ten percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from development on previously developed land where the runoff was not treated by one or more water quality best management practices; and achieve a 40 percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from agricultural uses. 
(b)  General performance standards for development and redevelopment. 
(1)  Land development, redevelopment, or disturbance shall be limited to the minimum area necessary to provide for the proposed use or development. 
a.  The submitted site plan shall indicate the limits of the proposed land disturbance, including areas for clearing or grading and shall be limited to the minimum area necessary to provide for the construction footprint. These limits shall be clearly shown on submitted plan and physically marked on the development site. 
b.  Ingress and egress during construction shall be limited to one access point. 
(2)  Indigenous vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the use or development proposed and in accordance with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook. 
a.  Existing trees over two inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) shall be preserved outside the construction footprint. Diseased trees or trees weakened by age, storm, fire, or other injury, as documented in writing to the director of planning by a landscape architect or a certified arborist who holds a current membership in either the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), the Tree Care Industry Association, or the American Society of Consulting Arborists (ASCA), may be removed. 
b.  Other woody vegetation onsite shall be preserved outside the approved construction footprint. 
c.  Clearing shall be allowed only to provide necessary access, positive site drainage, water quality BMPs, and the installation of utilities. 
(3)  Prior to clearing or grading, suitable protective barriers, such as fencing of a type detailed in the Landscape Planting and Protection Manual, Portsmouth, Virginia shall be erected five feet outside of the dripline of any tree or stand of trees to be preserved. These protective barriers shall remain so erected throughout all phases of construction. The storage of equipment, materials, debris, or fill shall not be allowed within the area protected by the barrier. 
(4)  Land development, redevelopment or land disturbance which adds impervious cover shall minimize impervious cover to promote infiltration of stormwater into the ground consistent with the proposed use or development. Pervious surfaces where soil conditions and/or water table permit shall be used for any parking area, maneuvering aisle, or other low traffic driveway. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or exceptions or exemptions thereto, any land disturbing activity exceeding 2,500 square feet, including construction of all single-family houses, septic tanks, and drainfields, shall also comply with the requirements of chapter 11 of this Code (erosion and sediment control). 
(6)  Where the best management practices require regular or periodic maintenance in order to continue their functions, such maintenance shall be ensured through a maintenance agreement between the owner or developer and the city or some other mechanism that achieves an equivalent objective. 
(7)  All on-site sewage disposal systems not requiring a VPDES permit shall be pumped out at least once every five years, in accordance with the provisions of section 38-312. 
(8)  For new construction a reserve sewage disposal site with a capacity at least equal to that of the primary sewage disposal site shall be provided, in accordance with section 38-313. This requirement shall not apply to any lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989, if such lot or parcel is not sufficient in capacity to accommodate a reserve sewage disposal site, as determined by the local health department. Building or construction of any impervious surface shall be prohibited on the area of all sewage disposal sites or on an on-site sewage treatment system, which operates under a permit issued by the state water control board, until the structure is served by public sewer. 
(9)  For any development or redevelopment, stormwater runoff shall be controlled by the use of best management practices consistent with the water quality protection provisions (4 VAC § 3-20-20-71 et seq.) of the Virginia Stormwater Management Regulations and shall achieve the following: 
a.  For development, the post-development nonpoint source pollution runoff load shall not exceed the pre-development load, based on the following land cover conditions for the city: lots platted before April 5, 1994, shall utilize 41 percent, lots platted after April 5, 1994, shall utilize 19 percent for the Elizabeth River Watershed, 40 percent for the Western Branch Watershed, and 54 percent for the Southern Branch Watershed; 
b.  For redevelopment, the nonpoint source pollution load shall be reduced by at least ten percent of the existing load. The city manager, or designee may waive or modify this requirement for redevelopment sites that originally incorporated best management practices for stormwater runoff quality control, provided that: 
1.  In no case may the post-development nonpoint source pollution runoff load exceed the predevelopment load; and 
2.  Best management practice facilities shall be in good working order and performing at the design levels of service. The city manager shall conduct a review of the original structural design and the maintenance plans of such facilities. The execution of a new maintenance agreement may be required to ensure compliance with these requirements. 
c.  For sites within IDAs or other isolated redevelopment sites, the nonpoint source pollution load shall be reduced by at least ten percent; 
d.  For redevelopment, both the pre- and post-development loadings shall be calculated by the procedures outlined by the current Virginia Stormwater Management Handbook Manual. Calculations involving the percentage of site area under impervious cover shall be based upon the lot area landward of mean high water and wetlands. However, where the design data is available, the original post-development nonpoint source pollution loadings can be substituted for the existing development loadings; and 
e.  Stormwater management criteria for redevelopment shall apply to any redevelopment, whether or not it is located within an intensely developed area designated by the city. 
(10)  Prior to initiating grading or other on-site activities on any portion of a lot or parcel, all required federal, state, and local permits shall be obtained and evidence of such submitted to the city engineer, in accordance with section 9.1-11. 
(c)  Criteria RPAs. 
(1)  Allowable land uses in the RPA. A water quality impact assessment in conformance with subsection 9.1-11(6) shall be submitted for all proposed land disturbances in the RPA. Land disturbances may be allowed only if one or more of the following conditions exist:

4.  The proposal is reviewed in coordination with the site plan, subdivision and plan of development review processes. 
f.  It is a flood control or stormwater facility that drains or treats water from multiple development projects or from a significant portion of a watershed, which meets the following: 
1.  The location of the facility has been found to be the optimum location by the city; 
2.  The size of the facility is the minimum necessary to provide the necessary flood control, stormwater treatment or both; 
3.  The facility is consistent with chapter 31.1 (stormwater management) and has been approved as a Phase I modification of the city's Chesapeake Bay Program; 
4.  All applicable permits for work in and around state and federal waters have been obtained and received prior to construction; 
5.  Approval must be received from the city prior to construction; and 
6.  Routine maintenance may be performed on such facilities to assure that they continue to function as designed. 
(2)  Exemptions in RPAs. The following land disturbances in the resource protection area may be considered exempt:

2.  Any land disturbance exceeding an area of 2,500 square feet shall comply with chapter 11 (erosion and sediment control) of this Code. 
(3)  Buffer area requirements. To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on the other components of resource protection areas, state waters, and aquatic life, a 100-foot buffer area of vegetation that is effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff shall be retained if present and established where it does not exist. 
The buffer area shall be located adjacent to and landward of other RPA components and along both sides of any water bodies with perennial flow. The full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the RPA, in accordance with sections 9.1-4 and 9.1-11. Notwithstanding permitted uses, encroachments, and vegetation clearing as set forth in this section, the 100-foot wide buffer area is not reduced in width. The 100-foot buffer area shall be deemed to achieve a 75 percent reduction of sediments and a 40 percent reduction of nutrients. 
(4)  Permitted encroachments into the buffer area. 
a.  When the application of the buffer area would result in the loss of a buildable area on a lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989, the director of planning, after consulting with the city engineer, may allow encroachments into the buffer in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  Encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utilities;

2.  Conditions or mitigation measures imposed through a previously approved exception shall be met; 
3.  If the use of a best management practice (BMP) was previously required, the BMP shall be evaluated to determine if it continues to function effectively and, if necessary, the BMP shall be reestablished or repaired and maintained, as required; and 
4.  The requirements set forth in subsections (4)a.1.(4)a.3. of this section have been met. 
(5)  Permitted modifications of the buffer area. In order to achieve the functional value of the buffer, existing vegetation may be removed, subject to approval by the city planning director, only to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths, general woodlot management, and best management practices, including those that prevent upland erosion and concentrated flows of stormwater, as follows: 
a.  Trees may be pruned or removed as necessary to provide for reasonable sight lines and vistas, provided that where removed, they shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff. 
b.  Any path shall be constructed and surfaced as to effectively control erosion. 
c.  Dead, diseased, or dying trees or shrubbery and noxious weeds such as Johnson grass, kudzu and multiflora rose may be removed and thinning of trees may be allowed, pursuant to sound horticulture practice.

(6)  Water quality impact assessment. 
a.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the water quality impact assessment is to: 
1.  Identify the impacts of proposed development, redevelopment or land disturbance on water quality and lands within RPAs and other environmentally sensitive lands; 
2.  Ensure that, where development, redevelopment, or land disturbance does take place within RPAs and other sensitive lands, it will be located on those portions of a site and in a manner that will be least disruptive to the natural functions of RPAs and other sensitive lands; 
3.  To protect individuals from investing funds for improvements proposed for location on lands unsuited for such development because of high ground water, erosion, or vulnerability to flood and storm damage; 
4.  Provide for administrative relief from the terms of this chapter when warranted and in accordance with the requirements contained herein; and 
5.  Specify mitigation which will address water quality protection. 
b.  Water quality impact assessment required. A water quality impact assessment is required for: (i) any proposed land disturbance, development, or redevelopment, within an RPA, (ii) any development in a RMA as deemed necessary by the city engineer due to the unique characteristics of the site or intensity of the proposed development. There shall be two levels of water quality impact assessments: a minor assessment and a major assessment. 
c.  Minor water quality impact assessment. A minor water quality impact assessment pertains only to development within an RPA, which causes no more than 5,000 square feet of land disturbance. Submission of a plan of development that demonstrates through the use of calculations provided for by subsection (4)a. of this section that the remaining buffer area and necessary best management practices will result in removal of no less than 75 percent of sediments and 40 percent of nutrients from post-development stormwater runoff shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirement for a minor water quality impact assessment. The following elements shall be included in the preparation and submission of a minor water quality assessment: 
1.  Site plan indicating the location of the components of the RPA, including the 100-foot buffer area; 
2.  Location and nature of the proposed encroachment into the buffer area, including: type of paving material, limits for areas of clearing or grading, location of any structures, drives for other impervious cover and sewage disposal systems or reserve drainfield sites; and 
3.  Type and location of proposed best management practice to mitigate the proposed encroachment. 
d.  Major water quality impact assessment. A major water quality impact assessment shall be required for any development which: (i) exceeds 5,000 square feet of land disturbance within an RPA; or (ii) is located in a RMA and is deemed necessary by the city engineer. The information required in this section shall be considered a minimum. The following elements shall be included in the preparation and submission of a major water quality assessment: 
1.  All of the information required in a minor water quality impact assessment, as specified in subsection (6)c. of this section; 
2.  A hydrogeological element that: 
(i)  Describes the existing topography, soils, hydrology and geology of the site and adjacent lands; 
(ii)  Describes the impacts of the proposed development on topography, soils, hydrology and geology on the site and adjacent lands; 
(iii)  Indicates the disturbance or destruction of wetlands and justification for such action; 
(iv)  Indicates the disruptions or reductions in the supply of water to wetlands, streams, lakes, rivers or other water bodies; 
(v)  Indicates the disruptions to existing hydrology including wetland and stream circulation patterns; 
(vi)  Indicates the source location and description of proposed fill material; 
(vii)  Indicates the location of dredge material and location of dumping area for such material; 
(viii)  Indicates the location of and impacts on shellfish beds, submerged aquatic vegetation, and fish spawning areas; and 
(ix)  Describes the proposed mitigation measures for the potential hydrogeological impacts which may include: 
(A)  Proposed erosion and sediment control concepts which may include minimizing the extent of the cleared area, perimeter controls, reduction of runoff velocities, measures to stabilize disturbed areas, schedule and personnel for site inspection; 
(B)  Proposed stormwater management system; 
(C)  Creation of wetlands to replace those lost; and 
(D)  Minimizing cut and fill. 
3.  A landscape element that describes the proposed measures for mitigation of the water quality and land impacts within CBPAs. Possible mitigation measures include: 
(i)  Replanting schedule for trees and other significant vegetation removed for construction, in accordance with section 36-52 of the City Code. 
(ii)  Demonstration that the design of the plan will preserve to the greatest extent possible any significant trees and vegetation on the site and will provide maximum erosion control and overland flow benefits from such vegetation. 
(iii)  Demonstration that indigenous plants are to be used to the greatest extent possible. 
4.  As part of any major water quality impact assessment submittal, the city engineer may require review by the Chesapeake Bay Local Assistance Division (CBLAD). Upon receipt of a major water quality impact assessment, the city engineer will determine if such review is warranted and may request CBLAD to review the assessment and respond with written comments. Any comments by CBLAD will be incorporated into the final review by the city engineer, provided that such comments are provided by CBLAD within 90 days of the request. 
e.  Evaluation procedure. 
1.  Upon the completed review of a minor water quality impact assessment, the city engineer will determine if the following criteria have been satisfied: 
(i)  The proposed encroachment is necessary due to the inability to place improvements elsewhere on the site to avoid disturbance of the buffer area; 
(ii)  Impervious surface is minimized; 
(iii)  Proposed best management practices, where required, achieve the requisite reductions in pollutant loadings; 
(iv)  Proposed mitigation measures, including the revegetation plan and site design, result in minimal disturbance to all components of the RPA, including the 100-foot buffer area; and 
(v)  The development, as proposed, meets the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
2.  Upon the completed review of a major water quality impact assessment, the city engineer will determine if the proposed development is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter and that the following criteria have been satisfied: 
(i)  Within any RPA, the proposed development is a water-dependent facility; 
(ii)  The disturbance of any wetlands will be minimized and the applicant will provide a statement on the plans that wetland permits will be obtained prior to the issuance of any other permits or approvals; 
(iii)  Proposed erosion and sediment control concepts are adequate to achieve the reductions in runoff and prevent off-site sedimentation; 
(iv)  Proposed stormwater management concepts are adequate to control the stormwater runoff to achieve the required performance standard for pollutant control; 
(v)  Proposed revegetation of disturbed areas will provide optimum erosion and sediment control benefits; 
(vi)  The design and location of any proposed drainfield will be in accordance with the requirements of section 9.1-10; 
(vii)  The cumulative impact of the proposed development, when considered in relation to other development in the vicinity, both existing and proposed, will not result in a significant degradation of water quality; and 
(viii)  The development, as proposed, is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
3.  The city engineer shall require additional mitigation where potential impacts have not been adequately addressed. Evaluation of mitigation measures will be made by the city engineer based on the criteria listed in subsections (6)e.1. and (6)e.2. of this section. 
(7)  Final plan. Final plans for property within CBPAs shall be final plats for land to be subdivided or site plans for land not to be subdivided as required in the zoning ordinance. 
a.  Final plans for all lands within CBPAs shall include the following additional information:

2.  The delineation of required buffer areas; 
3.  All wetlands permits required by law; and 
4.  A maintenance agreement as deemed necessary and appropriate by the city engineer to ensure proper maintenance of best management practices in order to continue their functions. 
b.  Installation and bonding requirements. 
1.  Where buffer areas, landscaping, stormwater management facilities or other specifications of an approved plan are required, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the installation of required plant materials or facilities is completed, in accordance with the approved site plan. 
2.  When the occupancy of a structure is desired prior to the completion of the required landscaping, stormwater management facilities, or other specifications of an approved plan, a certificate of occupancy may be issued only if the applicant provides to the city a form of surety satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the value of the remaining plant materials, related materials, and installation costs of the required landscaping or other specifications or maintenance costs for any required stormwater management facilities. 
3.  All required landscaping shall be installed and approved by the first planting season following issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the surety may be forfeited to the city. 
4.  All required stormwater management facilities or other specifications shall be installed and approved within 18 months of project commencement. Should the applicant fail, after proper notice, to initiate, complete or maintain appropriate actions required by the approved plan, the surety may be forfeited to the city. The city may collect from the applicant the amount by which the reasonable cost of required actions exceeds the amount of the surety held. 
5.  After all required actions of the approved site plan have been completed, the applicant must submit a written request for a final inspection. If the requirements of the approved plan have been completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer, such unexpended or unobligated portion of the surety held shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated within 60 days following the receipt of the applicant's request for final inspection. The city engineer may require a certificate of substantial completion from a professional engineer or class IIIB surveyor before making a final inspection. 
(8)  Administrative responsibility. Administration of the plan of development process shall be in accordance with the zoning ordinance set out in chapter 40 or chapter 33 regarding subdivisions. 
(9)  Denial of plan, appeal of conditions or modifications. In the event the final plan or any component of the plan of development process is disapproved and recommended conditions or modifications are unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant may appeal such administrative decision to the planning commission. In granting or denying an appeal, the planning commission must find such plan to be in accordance with all applicable ordinances and include necessary elements to mitigate any detrimental impact on water quality and upon adjacent property and the surrounding area and such plan meets the purpose and intent of the performance standards in this chapter. If the planning commission finds that the applicant's plan does not meet the above stated criteria, it shall deny approval of the plan.

(b)  The plan-approving authority shall periodically inspect the land-disturbing activity in accordance with applicable regulations to ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. The owner, permittee, or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection. If the plan-approving authority determines that there is a failure to comply with the plan, notice shall be served upon the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or in the plan certification, or by delivery at the site of the land-disturbing activities to the agent or employee supervising such activities. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. Upon failure to comply within the specified time, the permit may be revoked and the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be deemed to be in violation of this article and shall be subject to the penalties provided by this article. 
(c)  Upon determination of a violation of this article, the plan-approving authority may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in this article, issue an order requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken. If land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan, the plan-approving authority may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in this section, issue an order requiring that all of the land-disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any required permits are obtained. Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the commonwealth, or where the land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan or any required permits, such an order may be issued without regard to whether the permittee has been issued a notice to comply as specified in this section. Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after the permittee has failed to comply with such a notice to comply. The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven days from the date of service pending application by the enforcing authority or by the permit holder for appropriate relief to the Portsmouth Circuit Court. If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved plan or any required permits within seven days from the date of service of the order, the plan-approving authority may issue an order to the owner requiring that all construction and other work on the site, other than corrective measures, be stopped until an approved plan and any required permits have been obtained. Such an order shall be served upon the owner by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or the land records of the city. The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the Portsmouth Circuit Court. Any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey an order issued by the plan-approving authority may be compelled in a proceeding instituted in the Portsmouth Circuit Court to obey same and to comply therewith by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate remedy. Upon completion and approval of corrective action or obtaining an approved plan or any required permits, the order shall immediately be lifted. Nothing in this section shall prevent the plan-approving authority from taking any other action authorized by this article.

(a)  [Reserved.] 
(b)  The plan-approving authority or the owner of property which has sustained damage or which is in imminent danger of being damaged, may apply to the circuit court to enjoin a violation or a threatened violation of this article, without the necessity of showing that an adequate remedy at law does not exist. However, an owner of property shall not apply for injunctive relief unless: 
(1)  He has notified in writing the alleged violator, and the program authority, that a violation of the local program has caused, or creates a probability of causing, damage to his property; and 
(2)  Neither the alleged violator nor the program authority has taken corrective action within 15 days to eliminate the conditions which have caused, or create the probability of causing, damage to his property. 
(c)  In addition to any civil penalties provided under this article, any person who violates any provision of this article may be liable to the city in a civil action for damages. 
(d)  Without limiting the remedies which may be obtained in this article, any person violating or failing, neglecting, or refusing to obey any injunction, mandamus or other remedy obtained pursuant to this section shall be subject, in the discretion of the court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000.00 for each violation. The city may bring a civil action for such violation or failure. Any civil penalties assessed by a court shall be paid into the treasury of the city, except that where the violator is the locality itself, or its agent, the court shall direct the penalty to be paid into the state treasury. 
(e)  With the consent of any person who has violated or failed, neglected or refused to obey any regulation or condition of a permit or any provision of this article, such person shall pay a civil charge in an amount identified at the time of the issuance of the land-disturbing permit. Such charge shall be not less than $100.00 nor more than $2,000.00 for each violation or noncompliance with any regulation or condition of a permit or any provision of this article. Such civil charge shall be instead of any appropriate civil penalty that could be imposed under subsection (d) of this section. 
(f)  The commonwealth's attorney shall, upon request of the city or the permit issuing authority, take legal action to enforce the provisions of this article. 
(g)  Compliance with the provisions of this article shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or equitable proceeding for damages caused by erosion, siltation or sedimentation that all requirements of law have been met, and the complaining party must show negligence in order to recover any damages.

(a)  Any applicant who is aggrieved by any action of the city or its agent in disapproving plans submitted pursuant to this article shall have the right to apply for and receive a review of such action by the public utilities/public works director or his designee provided an appeal is filed with the public utilities/public works director or his designee within 30 days from the date of the action. The public utilities/public works director or his designee shall conduct an appeal hearing within 30 days from receiving a request for such hearing. In reviewing the agent's actions, the public utilities/public works director or his designee shall consider credible evidence and professional opinions presented by the aggrieved applicant and the city's agent. After considering the credible evidence and professional opinions, the action may be affirmed, reversed or modified. The public utilities/public works director's or his designee's decision shall be in writing, setting forth factual findings and conclusions, and shall be final, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  The decision of the public utilities/public works director or his designee shall be subject to review by the circuit court, provided an appeal is filed within 30 days from the date of any written decision adversely affecting the rights, duties, or privileges of the person engaging in or proposing to engage in land-disturbing activities. 
(Code 1988, § 11-8; Ord. No. 2005-98, § 1, 11-22-2005)  
Sec. 11-9. - Variances. 
The plan-approving authority may waive or modify any of the regulations in this section that are deemed inappropriate or too restrictive for site conditions by granting a variance. A variance may be granted under these conditions: 
(1)  At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance to become part of the approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant shall explain the reasons for requesting variances in writing. Specific variances that are allowed by the plan-approving authority shall be documented in the plan. 
(2)  During construction, the person responsible for implementing the approved plan may request a variance in writing from the plan-approving authority. The plan-approving authority shall respond in writing either approving or disapproving such a request. If the plan-approving authority does not approve a variance within ten days of receipt of the request, the request shall be considered to be disapproved. Following disapproval, the applicant may resubmit a variance request with additional documentation. 
(3)  The plan-approving authority shall consider variance requests judiciously, keeping in mind both the need of the applicant to maximize cost effectiveness and the need to protect off-site properties and resources from damage.

(e)  No bidder who is permitted to withdraw a bid pursuant to this section shall, for compensation, supply any material or labor to or perform any subcontract or other work agreement for the person or firm to whom the contract is awarded or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, from the performance of the project for which the withdrawn bid was submitted. 
(f)  If the purchasing administrator denies the withdrawal of a bid under the provisions of this section, he shall notify the bidder in writing stating the reasons for his decision and award the contract to such bidder at the bid price, provided such bidder is a responsible and responsive bidder.

DIVISION 4. - COMPETITIVE NEGOTIATIONS 
 
Sec. 12-276. - Negotiation for other than professional services generally. 
(a)  Upon a determination made in advance by the purchasing administrator and set forth in writing that competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not fiscally advantageous to the public, goods, services or insurance may be procured by competitive negotiation. The writing shall document the basis for this determination. 
(b)  Proposals shall be solicited from potential contractors by request for proposals which shall be in writing and shall indicate in general terms that which is sought to be procured, specifying the factors which will be used in evaluating the proposal, indicating whether a numerical scoring system will be used in evaluation of the proposal, and containing or incorporating by reference the other applicable contractual terms and conditions, including any unique capabilities, specifications or qualifications that will be required. In the event that a numerical scoring system will be used in the evaluation of proposals, the point values assigned to each of the evaluation criteria shall be included in the request for proposals or posted at the location designated for public posting of procurement notices prior to the due date and time for receiving proposals. No request for proposals for construction authorized by this article shall condition a successful offeror's eligibility on having a specified experience modification factor. 
(c)  At least ten days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals, public notice shall be given by posting the request for proposals on the state department of general services electronic procurement website or other appropriate websites. In addition, proposals shall be published in a publication or newspaper of general circulation in the city. In addition, a proposal may be solicited directly from potential contractors. 
(d)  Selection shall be made of two or more offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals, on the basis of the factors involved in the request for proposals, including price if so stated in the request for proposal. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the offerors so selected. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole determining factor. After negotiations have been conducted with each offeror or offerors so selected, the purchasing administrator shall select the offeror which, in his opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that offeror or offerors. When the terms and conditions of multiple awards are so provided in the request for proposals, awards may be made to more than one offeror. Should the purchasing administrator determine in writing and in his sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offers. In conducting discussions, evaluations, and negotiations there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. 
(e)  Awards shall be made to the responsible offeror or offerors whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain a statement in writing of the basis on which the award was made.

Sec. 12-278. - Negotiation for professional services. 
(a)  Professional services shall be procured by competitive negotiation when the cost of the professional services is expected to exceed $60,000.00. The purchasing administrator and representative of the using department or agency shall engage in individual discussions with two or more offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial responses, with emphasis on professional competence, to provide the required services. Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. Such offerors shall be encouraged to elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the proposed project, as well as alternative concepts. The request for proposals shall not, however, request that offerors furnish estimates of man-hours or cost for services. At the discussion stage, nonbinding estimates of total project cost, including, where appropriate, life cycle costing and nonbinding estimates of prices for services, may be discussed. Proprietary information from competing offerors shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of discussion outlined herein, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the selection process to this point, the purchasing administrator shall select, in the order of preference, two or more offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract satisfactory and advantageous to the city can be negotiated at a price considered fair and reasonable, the award shall be made to that offeror. Otherwise, negotiations with the offeror ranked first shall be formally terminated and negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked second, and so on until such a contract can be negotiated at a fair and reasonable price. When the terms and conditions of multiple awards are so provided in the request for proposals, awards may be made to more than one offeror. Should the purchasing administrator determine in writing that, in his sole discretion, only one offeror is fully qualified or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. 
(b)  A contract for architectural or professional engineering services relating to multiple construction projects may be negotiated by a public body, provided: (i) the projects require similar experience and expertise, (ii) the nature of the projects is clearly identified in the request for proposal, and (iii) the contract term is limited to one year or when the cumulative total project fees reach the maximum cost authorized in this paragraph, whichever occurs first. Such contract may be renewable for four additional one-year terms at the option of the public body. Under such contract: (a) the fair and reasonable prices, as negotiated, shall be used in determining the cost of each project performed, (b) the sum of all projects performed in one contract term shall not exceed $6,000,000.00; and (c) the project fee of any single project shall not exceed $1,500,000.00. Any unused amounts from the first contract term shall not be carried forward to the additional term. Competitive negotiations for such contracts may result in awards to more than one offeror provided: (1) the request for proposal so states, and (2) the public body has established procedures for distributing multiple projects among the selected contractors during the contract term. Such procedures shall prohibit requiring the selected contractors to compete for individual projects based on price.

(c)  The existence of a cause for debarment does not require that the contractor be debarred. If cause does exist, the purchasing administrator may debar at any time up to two years after having actual knowledge thereof. Failure to debar forthwith upon learning of cause shall not comprise a waiver of the right to debar at a later time; and a contractor may be awarded a contract but put on terms to avoid a possible future debarment. 
(d)  If a contractor engages in unacceptable conduct that could, in consideration with other future acts, be a basis for debarment, the purchasing administrator may, in his discretion, notify the contractor in writing that the misconduct, unsatisfactory performance, or failure to perform, if aggravated by future acts, could result in debarment. 
(e)  If the decision is made to debar, written notice shall be provided to the contractor. The notice shall: 
(1)  State the reasons for the debarment in terms sufficient to put the contractor on notice of the basis for the decision and the period of time for the debarment; 
(2)  State the procedures the contractor may take to examine the information or evidence supporting the debarment; and 
(3)  Inform the contractor of the right to appeal in writing to the city manager within ten days of issuance of the written notice. 
(f)  If a contractor is debarred, the debarment shall also apply to any other business entity formed with the same resources, owners, principals, or stockholders as the debarred contractor. 
(g)  The purchasing administrator shall have the discretion to rescind or modify a debarment, if he concludes in his sole discretion, based on credible evidence, that the contractor has been rehabilitated and that it would be in the public interest to take such action. 
(h)  The purchasing administrator shall maintain an up-to-date list showing the status of all debarred contractors. The list shall be made available for prompt review to any council member, upon request.

(b)  Upon receipt of a proper and timely appeal, the city manager shall schedule a hearing. The city manager may, in his sole discretion: 
(1)  Conduct the hearing himself; 
(2)  Have the hearing conducted by a designee who is a city employee; or 
(3)  Have the hearing conducted by a qualified and neutral mediator selected by the city manager, with the cost of the mediator to be borne by the contractor. If the contractor does not agree to pay said cost, the city manager may dismiss the appeal forthwith, and there shall be no further appeal from that decision. 
(c)  The hearing shall be informal, and it shall be conducted in private unless by agreement of the parties. The contractor shall be given a fair opportunity to present evidence and to try and explain why the debarment decision is not justified or proper, but strict rules of evidence and formal courtroom procedures shall not apply. 
(d)  If the city manager does not conduct the hearing himself, he shall receive a written or oral report from the person who did conduct it. He shall thereafter render a written decision. He shall have authority to affirm, reverse, or modify the debarment decision appealed from. 
(e)  The contractor shall have the right to appeal the city manager's decision to circuit court, except for the circumstances set forth in subsection (b)(3) above, under the following conditions: 
(1)  The appeal must be filed within 30 days of the city manager's decision. 
(2)  The appeal shall be based solely on the written record of the debarment procedure, and no new evidence shall be introduced or considered, nor shall witnesses be called to testify. 
(3)  The city manager's decision shall be affirmed unless there is no rational basis for it.

In addition to having debarment authority, the purchasing administrator shall have the authority to reject or to disqualify any company providing coverage for a bond or indemnification obligation of a contractor, if in the purchasing administrator's sole discretion there is a reasonable basis for doing so. Upon such a decision, reasonable oral or written notice shall be provided to the contractor. There shall be no right of appeal.

Sec. 13-89. - Additional standards. 
The fire prevention code is adopted in section 13-81 and these additional standards are adopted as follows: 
(1)  Inspection by others. The fire marshal may designate such other persons as he deems necessary to make fire safety inspections. Such persons shall use this chapter as the basis for such inspections. 
(2)  Impersonations. It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to use a badge, uniform or any other credential so as to gain access to any building, structure, marine vessel, vehicle or premises or to otherwise falsely identify himself as the fire marshal or his authorized representative. 
(3)  Right of entry. 
a.  Whenever necessary for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter or whenever the fire marshal has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any condition which makes such structure or premises unsafe, the fire marshal may enter such structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the fire marshal by this chapter; provided, that if such structure or premises is occupied, the fire marshal shall first present proper credentials and request entry. 
b.  Any person, including the owner, lessee, manager, operator or occupant of any structure or premises, who shall interfere in any way with or deny entry to the fire marshal or his designated representative while in lawful performance of his duty shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. 
c.  When such entry is refused, the fire marshal shall have recourse to any other remedy provided by law or equity to secure entry. 
(4)  Investigation of fires. 
a.  The fire marshal shall investigate or cause to be investigated any reported fire or explosion causing a loss of life or severe injury, or extensive destruction or damage to property, and all offenses involving fires, fire bombings, bombings, attempts or threats to commit such offenses, false alarms relating to such offenses and possession and/or manufacture of explosive devices, substances and fire bombs occurring within the jurisdiction. Such investigation shall be pursued until its conclusion. 
b.  The fire marshal or any investigator shall immediately take charge of any physical evidence relating to the cause and origin of such fire or explosion and preserve such physical evidence until it has been properly processed. 
(5)  Unsafe conditions. The fire official or fire officer in charge shall order the sealing of (thereby preventing the use of) any existing device or appliance including, but not limited to, those of heating, electrical or mechanical nature and components of fuel transportation, storage, distribution and utilization systems, or any other device or appliance found to be defective or in violation of this chapter's requirements for existing appliances after giving notice to this effect to any person, owner, firm, agent or operator in charge of same. The fire official or fire officer in charge may seal any device or appliance without notice when inspection shows the existence of an immediate fire hazard or a condition which may imperil human life. The sealed defective appliance shall remain withdrawn from service until all necessary repairs or alterations have been made. The "sealing" referred to herein shall be accomplished by the placing of a red tag or other notice on the defective device or appliance. 
(6)  Unauthorized use of sealed device or appliance. 
a.  It shall be unlawful for any person or user, firm or agent to continue the use of any device or appliance which has been sealed or ordered sealed under subsection (5) of this section, unless authority to remove said seal is given by the fire marshal. 
b.  Unauthorized removal or breakage of said seal, tag or notice shall constitute a class 1 misdemeanor. 
(7)  Correction of violation required. The imposition of the penalties herein described shall not prevent the fire marshal from instituting appropriate action to prevent unlawful construction or to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises, or to stop an illegal act, conduct business or use of a building or structure in or about any premises. 
(8)  Failure to correct violations. If the notice of the violation is not complied with within the time specified by the fire marshal, the fire marshal shall request the city attorney of the jurisdiction to institute the appropriate legal proceedings to restrain, correct or abate such violation or to require removal or termination of the unlawful use of the building or structure and violations of the provisions of this Code or of any order or direction made pursuant thereto. 
(9)  Storage or display in roof-over malls. No combustible goods, merchandise or decorations or vehicles shall be displayed or stored in a roofed-over mall unless approved by the fire marshal. 
(10)  Coniferous trees. The use of live or cut coniferous trees shall be prohibited in all occupancies or structures, except one-family and two-family dwellings, unless approved by the fire marshal. 
(11)  Artificial trees. Artificial trees may be used if they have been satisfactorily listed as being fire resistant or retardant by a nationally recognized laboratory or agency and/or meet with the approval of the fire marshal. 
(12)  Signs and markings. Signs and markings to designate fire lanes as required by the fire marshal shall be provided, installed and maintained by the property owner or his agent in a method and manner approved by the fire marshal. 
(13)  Illegal use. This section may be enforced by the fire marshal, his deputies and/or assistants, and by the city police department. 
(14)  General provisions. Any person engaged in the business of selling, servicing and installing portable fire extinguishers, fixed fire extinguishing systems or fire warning and detection systems in this city shall be registered with the fire prevention bureau. Every applicant for registration shall furnish the fire marshal with satisfactory proof of their qualifications to perform any and all functions for which they have requested registration. 
(15)  Storage areas. The markings of means of egress through storage areas may be required as deemed necessary and appropriate by the fire marshal. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or his agent or the occupant to mark and maintain such aisles as required. 
(16)  Fire personnel required. In every theater, opera house or other building, or on premises used for concerts, theatrical or operatic purposes, the seating capacity of which exceeds 500 persons, at least one experienced fire inspector, or as many as may be required by the fire marshal, whose competence shall be approved by the fire chief, shall be on duty during each performance and in charge of the fire protection equipment and maintenance of exitways required in such buildings or on such premises. All costs and expenses relating to this duty shall be the responsibility of the operator, sponsor or promoter of such event. Failure to comply with the requirement of this section shall constitute a class 1 misdemeanor.

Cross reference Building regulations, ch. 7; erosion and sediment control, excavation, ch. 11; housing and community development, ch. 17; zoning, ch. 40.1. 
State Law reference Flood Protection and Dam Safety Act, Code of Virginia, § 10.1-600 et seq. 
 
Sec. 14.1-1. - Purpose and statutory authorization. 
(a)  Statutory authorization [44 CFR 59.22(a)(2)]. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the statutory authority granted to localities by Code of Virginia § 10.1-600, et seq. 
(b)  Findings of fact. The flood hazard areas of Portsmouth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
Trends in tide data over the last 100 years suggest that Portsmouth is facing an increased danger of flooding caused by both sea level rise and subsidence. The data also suggest that Portsmouth may experience a rise in base flood elevations greater than four feet in the next 100 years. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to reduce the loss of life and property; to reduce the creation of health and safety hazards; to reduce the disruption of commerce and governmental services; to reduce the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief; and to reduce the impairment of the tax base by: 
(1)  Regulating uses, activities and development which, alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities and development, will cause damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies. 
(2)  Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development from locating within districts subject to flooding. 
(3)  Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and flood damage. 
(4)  Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
(5)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(6)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-2. - Applicability. 
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all privately and publicly owned lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Portsmouth and (a) identified as areas of special flood hazard according to the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that is provided to the City of Portsmouth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and dated August 3, 2015 or any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto or (b) otherwise deemed special flood hazard areas pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-3. - Compliance and liability. 
(a)  No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. 
(b)  The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study, but does not imply total flood protection. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as excessive rainfall, ice jams, and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or that land use within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
(c)  The provisions of this chapter shall not impose liability on the City of Portsmouth or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made hereunder. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-4. - Penalties. 
(a)  Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this chapter or any order of the floodplain administrator or his designee, or any authorized employee shall be guilty of the appropriate violation and subject to the penalties therefore. Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this chapter or any order of the floodplain administrator or his designee or any other authorized employee shall be guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. 
(b)  In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved, including an action seeking equitable relief for the proper enforcement of this chapter by the floodplain administrator or his designee or other authorized employee. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, the provisions of this chapter shall not excuse the violation or noncompliance so as to permit it to continue, and all violations shall be corrected or remedied within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or relocated in noncompliance of this chapter may be declared by the City of Portsmouth to be a public nuisance and abatable as such. Flood insurance and/or certificates of occupancy may be withheld from structures constructed in violation of this chapter.

(2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with this chapter. 
(3)  Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means a formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of SFHAs.

Substantial improvement means any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code requirements and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, historic structures undergoing work that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, shall comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places shall be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the provisions of this ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(a)  Description of special flood hazard areas. The various special flood hazard districts shall include the special flood hazard areas (SFHAs). The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the flood insurance study (FIS), and flood insurance rate map (FIRM) prepared for the City of Portsmouth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated August 3, 2015, and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto. The City of Portsmouth may identify and regulate local flood hazard or pending areas that are not delineated on the FIRM. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
The boundaries of the SFHA Districts are established as shown on the FIRM, which is declared to be a part of this ordinance and which shall be kept on file at the City of Portsmouth floodplain administrator's office, and which may include the following districts: 
(1)  The floodway district is in an AE Zone and is delineated, for purposes of this chapter, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one percent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. The areas included in this district, if any, are shown on the FIRM. Currently, according to the above-referenced FIRM (August 3, 2015),there are no floodways designated in the latest Portsmouth FIS. 
(2)  The AE or AH Zones on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which one percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided and the floodway has not been delineated. 
(3)  The A Zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the one percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated. 
(4)  The AO Zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas of shallow flooding identified as AO on the FIRM. 
(5)  The Coastal A Zone shall be those areas, as defined by the VA USBC, that are subject to wave heights between one and one-half and three feet, and identified on the FIRM as areas between the V zone and the limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA). 
(6)  The VE or V Zones on the FIRMs accompanying the FIS shall be those areas that are known as coastal high hazard areas, extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity (three-foot and higher) wave action. 
(b)  Overlay concept. 
(1)  The floodplain districts described above shall be in addition to and shall overlay all other zoning districts designated on the Official Zoning Ordinance Map as adopted by section 40.1 of this Code. The provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. 
(2)  In any conflict between the Code requirements for the floodplain districts and those for any underlying zoning district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the floodplain districts shall apply. 
(3)  In the event any provision concerning a floodplain district is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying provisions shall remain applicable. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 ; Ord. No. 2016-84 , § 1, 10-25-2016)

However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-9. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the floodplain administrator or his designee. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 ; Ord. No. 2016-84 , § 3, 10-25-2016)

a.  The Approximated Floodplain District shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a 100-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as Zone A on the maps accompanying the FIS. For these areas, the base flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific one percent annual chance flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this base flood elevation. For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted non-detailed technical concepts, such as point on boundary, high water marks, or detailed methodologies hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
b.  The floodplain administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for any development. When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to the design flood elevation (DFE). 
c.  During the permitting process, the floodplain administrator shall obtain: 
1)  The elevation of the lowest floor (including HVAC, all duct work, and the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; and 
2)  If the structure is non-residential has been flood-proofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed. Residential structures shall not be flood-proofed. 
d.

1)  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (including all HVAC and duct work but excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated above the base flood level by at least three feet; and 
2)  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (one-percent annual chance). 
b.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of Section 14.1-11(b)(6)(a)(2) of this code. 
c.

For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
1)  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
2)  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
f.  The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be partitioned into multiple rooms, temperature-controlled, or used for human habitation. 
g.  The use of fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited. When non-structural fill is proposed in a coastal high hazard area, appropriate engineering analyses shall be conducted to evaluate the impacts of the fill prior to issuance of a development permit. 
h.  The man-made alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage, is prohibited. 
i.  All recreational vehicles placed in V-zones shall be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, be fully licensed and ready for highway use or meet the same standards as for conventional housing in V-zones. 
(c)  Additional provisions for watercourse. 
(1)  Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any channels or of any watercourse, stream, etc., within this jurisdiction, a permit shall be obtained from the U.S. Corps of Engineers, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and the Virginia Marine Resource Commission (a joint permit application is available from any of these organizations).

(2)  The flood carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. 
(d)  Elevation and construction standards. In all identified flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS or generated by a certified professional in accordance with subsection 14.1-11(b)(3) of this code the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) in Zones A1-30, AE, AH and A with detailed base flood elevations shall have the lowest floor including HVAC, duct work, and basement, elevated to at least the design flood elevation which is the BFE plus 3.0 feet. No floodproofing below the design flood elevation (DFE) of residential construction is allowed. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least three feet above the base flood level. 
Buildings located in all A1-30, AE, and AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building components below the elevation corresponding to the BFE plus three feet are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Space below the lowest floor. In zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-A30, fully enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved structures, which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall: 
a.  Not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles. building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises.

b.  Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the design flood elevation which is the BFE plus three feet. 
c.  Include measures to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum design criteria; 
1)  Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2)  The total net area of all openings must be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
3)  If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit. 
4)  The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one foot above the adjacent grade. 
5)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
6)  Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above. 
(e)  Prohibited uses. 
(1)  The following uses shall be specifically prohibited within all "A", "AE", "V" and "VE" floodplain districts:

(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-12. - Design criteria for public improvements. 
(a)  Sanitary sewer facilities. All new or replacement sanitary sewer facilities and private package sewage treatment plants, including all pumping stations and collector systems, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and of discharges from the systems into the floodwaters.

The facilities shall ensure drainage away from buildings and on-site waste disposal sites. The city engineer may require a primary underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties. 
(d)  Utilities. All utilities, such as gas lines, electrical and telephone systems, being placed in floodprone areas should be located, elevated (where possible) and constructed to minimize the chance of impairment during a flooding occurrence. 
(e)  Streets and sidewalks. Streets and sidewalks should be designed to minimize their potential for increasing and aggravating the levels of flood flow. Drainage openings shall be designed to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-13. - Variances; factors to be considered. 
(a)  Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) after the board of zoning appeals has determined that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such variance will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre, deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. Variances may be issued by the board of zoning appeals for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the provisions of this section. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria of this section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. In passing upon applications for variances, the board of zoning appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and consider the following additional factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the 100-year flood elevation. 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
(3)  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
(4)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners. 
(5)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(6)  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
(7)  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
(8)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
(9)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
(10)  The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood. 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 
(12)  The historic nature of a structure. Variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(13)  Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this chapter. 
(b)  The board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters. 
(c)  Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
(d)  Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief. 
(e)  The board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
(f)  A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administrator. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )  
Sec. 14.1-14. - Conditions for use of existing structures. 
(a)  A structure or use of a structure or premises which lawfully existed in the floodplain district before the enactment of these provisions, but which is not in conformity with these provisions, may be continued subject to the following conditions:

b.  For additions that are 50 percent or more of the current market value of the existing building during a consecutive ten-year period, the addition and the existing building must be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and both the addition and the existing building shall be required to conform to the VA USBC. 
(4)  Existing structures in the floodway area shall not be expanded or enlarged unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed expansion would not result in any increase in the base flood elevation. 
( Ord. No. 2015-36, § 2(Exh. A), 6-9-2015 )

(21)  Upon the request of FEMA, complete and submit a report concerning participation in the NFIP which may request information regarding the number of buildings in the SFHA, number of permits issued for development in the SFHA, and number of variances issued for development in the SFHA. 
(22)  It is the duty of the floodplain administrator to take into account flood, mudslide and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use throughout the entire jurisdictional area of the community, whether or not those hazards have been specifically delineated geographically (e.g. via mapping or surveying). 
(c)  Use and interpretation of FIRMs. The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
(1)  Where field survey topography indicates that adjacent ground elevations: 
a.  Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations; 
b.  Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the SFHA. 
(2)  In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified SFHAs, any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 
(3)  Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations. 
(4)  Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 
(5)  If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA: 
a.  Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
b.  Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to subsection 14.1-11(b)(3)(a) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM. 
c.  Prior to issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
(d)  Jurisdictional boundary changes. 
(1)  The city floodplain ordinance in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the city for all annexed areas until the city adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. The city shall pass a resolution acknowledging and accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain ordinance standards prior to annexation of any area containing identified flood hazards. If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in this ordinance, the city shall prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the city council for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
(2)  In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 44 Subpart (B) Section 59.22(9)(v) all NFIP participating communities must notify the Federal Insurance Administration and optionally the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. 
(3)  In order that all flood insurance rate maps accurately represent the community's boundaries, a copy of a map of the community suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority must be included with the notification. 
(e)  Submitting technical data. Base flood elevations in the City of Portsmouth may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the city shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
(f)  Letters of map revision. When development in the floodplain causes a change in the base flood elevation, the applicant, including state agencies, must notify FEMA by applying for a conditional letter of map revision or a letter of map revision. Examples include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway. 
(2)  Any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation. 
(3)  Alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges.

(Code 1988, § 20-1; Ord. No. 1995-116, § 2, 12-12-1995)  
Sec. 20-2. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Affiliated group means: 
(1)  One or more chains of includable corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includable corporation if: 
a.  Stock possessing at least 80 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least 80 percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of each of the includable corporations, except the common parent corporation, is owned directly by one or more of the other includable corporations; and 
b.  The common parent corporation directly owns stock possessing at least 80 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least 80 percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of at least one of the other includable corporations. As used in this chapter, the term "stock" does not include nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends. The term "includable corporation" means any corporation within the affiliated group irrespective of the state or country of its incorporation; and the term "receipts" includes gross receipts and gross income. 
(2)  Two or more corporations if five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates or trusts own stock possessing: 
a.  At least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation; and 
b.  More than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation. 
When one or more of the includable corporations, including the common parent corporation is a nonstock corporation, the term "stock" as used in this article shall refer to the nonstock corporation membership or membership voting rights, as is appropriate to the context. 
(3)  Two or more entities if such entities satisfy the requirements in subsections (1) or (2) of this section as if they were corporations and the ownership interests therein were stock. 
Assessment means a determination as to the proper rate of tax, the measure to which the tax rate is applied, and ultimately the amount of tax, including additional or omitted tax, that is due. An assessment shall include a written assessment made pursuant to notice by the assessing official or a self-assessment made by a taxpayer upon the filing of a return or otherwise not pursuant to notice. Assessments shall be deemed made by an assessing official when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by the assessing official or an employee of the assessing official, or mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed, or if no return is required, when the tax is paid. A return filed or tax paid before the last day prescribed by ordinance for the filing or payment thereof shall be deemed to be filed or paid on the last day specified for the filing of a return or the payment of tax, as the case may be. 
Assessor or assessing official means the commissioner of revenue of this jurisdiction. 
Base year means the calendar year preceding the license year, except for contractors subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
Broker means an agent of a buyer or a seller who buys or sells stocks, bonds, commodities, or services, usually on a commission basis. 
Business means a course of dealing which requires the time, attention and labor of the person so engaged for the purpose of earning a livelihood or profit. It implies a continuous and regular course of dealing, rather than an irregular or isolated transaction. A person may be engaged in more than one business. The following acts shall create a rebuttable presumption that a person is engaged in a business: 
(1)  Advertising or otherwise holding oneself out to the public as being engaged in a particular business; or 
(2)  Filing tax returns, schedules and documents that are required only of persons engaged in a trade or business. 
Commodity means staples such as wool, cotton, etc., which are traded on a commodity exchange and on which there is trading in futures. 
Contractor shall have the meaning prescribed in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3714(B), whether such work is done or offered to be done by day labor, general contract or subcontract. 
Dealer means any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for his own account, but does not include a bank, or any person insofar as he buys or sells securities for his own account, either individually or in some fiduciary capacity, but not as part of a regular business. 
Definite place of business means an office or a location at which occurs a regular and continuous course of dealing for 30 consecutive days or more. A definite place of business for a person engaged in business may include a location leased or otherwise obtained from another person on a temporary or seasonal basis; and real property leased to another. A person's residence shall be deemed to be a definite place of business if there is no definite place of business maintained elsewhere and the person is not licensable as a peddler or itinerant merchant. 
Financial services means the buying, selling, handling, managing, investing and providing of advice regarding money, credit, securities and other investments and shall include the service for compensation by a credit agency, an investment company, a broker or dealer in securities and commodities or a security or commodity exchange, unless such service is otherwise provided for in this article. 
Gross receipts means the whole, entire, total receipts attributable to the licensed privilege, without deduction, except as may be limited by the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3700 et seq. 
License year means the calendar year for which a license is issued for the privilege of engaging in business. 
Personal services means rendering for compensation any repair, personal, business or other services not specifically classified as "financial, real estate or professional service" under this article, or rendered in any other business or occupation not specifically classified in this chapter unless exempted from local license tax by Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1 et seq. 
Professional services means services performed by architects, attorneys-at-law, certified public accountants, dentists, engineers, land surveyors, surgeons, veterinarians and practitioners of the healing arts (the arts and sciences dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of alleviation of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities) and such occupations, and no others, as the state department of taxation may list in the BPOL guidelines promulgated pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3701. The department shall identify and list each occupation or vocation in which a professed knowledge of some department of science or learning, gained by a prolonged course of specialized instruction and study is used by its practical application to the affairs of others, either advising, guiding, or teaching them, and in serving their interests or welfare in the practice of an art or science founded on it. The word "profession" implies attainments in professional knowledge as distinguished from mere skill, and the application of knowledge to uses for others rather than for personal profit. 
Purchases means all goods, wares and merchandise received for sale at each definite place of business of a wholesale merchant. The term shall also include the cost of manufacture of all goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by any wholesaler or wholesale merchant and sold or offered for sale. Such merchant may elect to report the gross receipts from the sale of manufactured goods, wares and merchandise if it cannot determine or chooses not to disclose the cost of manufacture. 
Real estate services means rendering a service for compensation as lessor, buyer, seller, agent or broker and providing a real estate service, unless the service is otherwise specifically provided for in this chapter, and such services include, but are not limited to, the following:

Retailer or retail merchant means any person or merchant who sells goods, wares and merchandise for use or consumption by the purchaser or for any purpose other than resale by the purchaser, but does not include sales at wholesale to institutional, commercial and industrial users.

State Law reference Definitions, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3700.1.  
Sec. 20-3. - License requirement; compliance with zoning ordinance prerequisite to issuance. 
(a)  Every person engaging in this jurisdiction in any business, trade, profession, occupation or calling (collectively hereinafter "a business") as defined in this section, unless otherwise exempted by law, shall apply for a license for each such business if: (i) such person maintains a definite place of business in this jurisdiction, (ii) such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does maintain an abode in this jurisdiction, which abode for the purposes of this section shall be deemed a definite place of business, or (iii) there is no definite place of business but such person operates amusement machines, is engaged as a peddler or itinerant merchant, carnival or circus as specified in Code of Virginia, §§ 58.1-3717, 58.1-3718 or 58.1-3728, respectively, or is a contractor subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715, or is a public service corporation subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3731. A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business. A person engaged in two or more businesses or professions carried on at the same place of business may elect to obtain one license for all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are satisfied: 
(1)  Each business or profession is licensable at the location and has satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of this jurisdiction; 
(2)  All of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate, or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and 
(3)  The taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts. 
(b)  Each person subject to a license tax shall apply for a license prior to beginning business, if he was not subject to licensing in this jurisdiction on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 1 of the current license year if he had been issued a license for the preceding license year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the assessing official. 
(c)  The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not based on gross receipts. If the tax is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before March 1. 
(d)  The assessing official may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90 days, in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the extension together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a penalty of ten percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(e)  A penalty of ten percent of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date. In addition to penalties for failure to file an application or failure to pay the license in a timely manner, a penalty for failure to file a return shall be no greater than ten percent of the tax assessable on such return or $10.00, whichever is greater. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the assessing official if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may be assessed if the assessing official determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the assessing official, if the application and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not paid within 30 days, the city treasurer may impose a ten percent late payment penalty. The penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the official who assessed them, if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. Acted responsibly means that: (i) the taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business, and (ii) the taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. Events beyond the taxpayer's control include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the assessing official, who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous information. 
(f)  Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax by the assessing official is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any tax paid under this chapter from the date of payment or due date, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate charged under Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3916. No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, in event of such adjustment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than 30 days from: (i) the date of the payment that created the refund, (ii) or the due date of the tax, whichever is later.

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to commence or to conduct any business or engage in any occupation or profession or to do any other thing for which a license tax is required under this chapter without first obtaining a license required under this chapter, or after having obtained the necessary license, to continue to do so for a longer period than one month after the expiration thereof. 
(b)  A violation of this section shall constitute a class 1 misdemeanor, and each day of default or violation shall constitute a separate offense. A conviction of such offense shall not relieve any person from the payment of any license tax imposed by this chapter. 
(c)  In addition to the penalties provided for in this section, or in addition thereto, the commissioner of revenue shall have the right to seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any continuing violation. 
(d)  The commissioner of revenue or his designees and the police department may initiate court action for any violation of this section.

Sec. 20-5. - Situs of gross receipts. 
(a)  General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this article is measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within this jurisdiction. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed, or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality. 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed. 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of personal services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b)  Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement, except as to circumstances set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3709, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this jurisdiction solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c)  Agreements. The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of the state concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than 100 percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved.

Sec. 20-5.1. - Enforcement; limitations and extensions. 
(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this article, both the assessing official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to this assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the assessing official shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six preceding years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this subsection, two years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 20-5.2(b) and (d) of this article, or two years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984 or similar law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later.

State Law reference Limitations and extensions, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3703(A)(4).  
Sec. 20-5.2. - Enforcement; appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a licensing tax under this article as the result of an audit may apply within 90 days from the date of the assessment to the assessing official for a correction of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, audit period, remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The assessor may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the applications. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The assessor shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed in the jurisdiction (e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed). 
(b)  Provided an application is made within 90 days of an assessment, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the assessor, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 20-3(f), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires: 
(1)  To depart quickly from the locality; 
(2)  To remove his property therefrom; 
(3)  To conceal himself or his property therein; or 
(4)  To do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c)  Any person assessed with a license tax under this article as a result of an audit may apply within 90 days of the determination by the assessing official on an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to the tax commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The tax commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1821, and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous. Neither the tax commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(d)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subsection (c) of this section, the assessing official shall further suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 20-3(f), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of the tax to a specific situation from the assessor. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if: (i) there is a change in the law, a court decision, or (ii) the assessor notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect.

Sec. 20-5.3. - Recordkeeping and audits. 
Every person who is assessable with a license tax shall keep sufficient records to enable the assessor to verify the correctness of the tax paid for the license years assessable and to enable the assessor to ascertain what is the correct amount of tax that was assessable for each of those years. All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be open to inspection and examination by the assessor in order to allow the assessor to establish whether a particular receipt is directly attributable to the taxable privilege exercised within this jurisdiction. The assessor shall provide the taxpayer with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office, if the records are maintained there. In the event the records are maintained outside this jurisdiction, copies of the appropriate books and records shall be sent to the assessor's office upon demand.

Sec. 20-5.4. - Gross receipts; exclusions and deductions. 
(a)  General rule. Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not include any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business or profession. 
(b)  Exclusions. The following items shall be excluded from gross receipts: 
(1)  Amounts received and paid to the United States, the commonwealth or any county, city or town for the state retail sales or use tax, or for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on cigarettes, for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels. 
(2)  Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business). 
(3)  Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the business to its customer. 
(4)  Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the obligor. 
(5)  Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon the sale of a capital asset. 
(6)  Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by the licensee. A rebate or other incentive offered to induce the recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a person other than the offeror, and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration of the sale of goods and services shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the licensee, but shall be included in the licensee's gross receipts together with any handling or other fees related to the incentive. 
(7)  Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution and for which no consideration is received and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory, whether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. 
(8)  Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a licensable business not classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the licensed privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, late fees and similar income attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular course of business. 
(c)  Deductions. The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases that would otherwise be taxable: 
(1)  Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to a United States federal or state government entity provided that such property was purchased within two years of the sale to such entity by the original purchaser who shall have been contractually obligated at the time of purchase to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This deduction shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply to only the original cost of the property and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not apply to any of the tangible personal property which was the subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or federal government entity in accordance with the original contract obligation. 
(2)  Any receipts attributable to business conducted in another state or foreign county in which the taxpayer is liable for an income or other tax based upon income.

In the event any person required to pay a license tax under the provisions of this chapter where the license tax is a flat amount, calculated without regard to gross receipts, shall begin the business, occupation or calling after March 1 of the license year, the license tax shall be prorated on a monthly basis, with one-twelfth of the annual license tax to be assessed for each month or portion thereof for the remainder of the license year.

Sec. 22-270. - Weighing vehicles; procedure; shifting loads; unloading excess load; weighing fee; certificate as to accuracy of scales admissible in evidence; penalties. 
(a)  Any law enforcement officer, having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful, is authorized to weigh the load and the vehicle. If the place where the vehicle is stopped is ten road miles or less from a permanent weighing station, the officer may, and upon demand of the driver shall, require the vehicle to proceed to such station. If the distance to the nearest permanent weighing station is more than ten road miles such vehicle may be weighed by wheel load weighers. Any driver who fails or unreasonably refuses to drive his vehicle to such permanent weighing station or such scales or wheel load weighers upon the request and direction of the officer to do so shall be guilty of a class 4 misdemeanor. The penalty for such violation shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed for exceeding the maximum weight permitted or for any other violation. 
(b)  In the event of such failure or unreasonable refusal, where the officer has reason to believe the vehicle is overweight, the officer may use whatever reasonable means are available to have the vehicle weighed, including the employment of a tow truck to move the vehicle to the weighing area. He may also use whatever means are necessary to reload the vehicle if the load is intentionally dumped. In such a case, any expenses incurred in having the vehicle weighed may be taxed as costs to be imposed upon the operator who failed or unreasonably refused to drive his vehicle to such weighing area, when he has been convicted of such failure or refusal and an overweight violation. In all cases where such failure or refusal or overweight charges are dismissed, payment shall be made from highway funds. 
(c)  Should the officer find that the weight of any vehicle and its load is greater than that permitted by law or that the weight of the load carried in or on such vehicle is greater than that which the vehicle is licensed to carry under the provisions of this title, he may require the driver to unload, at the nearest place where the property unloaded may be stored or transferred to another vehicle, such portion of the load as may be necessary to decrease the gross weight of the vehicle to the maximum therefor permitted by this title. Any property so unloaded shall be stored or cared for by the owner or operator of the overweight vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator. 
(d)  However, notwithstanding the provisions of Code of Virginia, §§ 46.2-112246.2-1127, should the officer find that the gross weight of the vehicle and its load is within limits permitted under this title and does not exceed the limit for which the vehicle is registered, but that the axle weight of any axle of the vehicle exceeds that permitted under this title, the driver shall be allowed one hour to shift his load within or on that same vehicle in order to bring the axle weight within proper limits. However, liquidated damages shall be assessed under section 22-274 based on the weight prior to shifting the load, unless the load can be successfully shifted to bring the vehicle's axle weight within limits permitted under this title by: (i) sliding the axle of the semitrailer or the fifth wheel of the tractor truck, (ii) repositioning the load if the motor vehicle is transporting off-the-road mobile construction equipment, or (iii) adjusting the load if the vehicle is operating on noninterstate highways and qualifies for weight extensions pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 46.2-1129. Such load shifting shall be performed at the site where the vehicle was weighed and found to exceed allowable axle weight limits. No such load shifting shall be allowed if such load is required to be placarded as defined in Code of Virginia, § 10.1-1450 and consists of hazardous material as defined in Code of Virginia, § 10.1-1400. 
(e)  If the driver of an overloaded vehicle is convicted, forfeits bail, or purchases an increased license as a result of such weighing, the court in addition to all other penalties shall assess and collect a weighing fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code from the owner or operator of the vehicle and shall forward such fee to the city treasurer. Upon receipt of the fee, the city treasurer shall allocate the same to the fund appropriated for the administration and maintenance of the police department. 
(f)  In any court or legal proceedings in which any question arises as to the calibration or accuracy of any such scales at permanent weighing stations or wheel load weighers, a certificate, executed and signed under oath by the inspector calibrating or testing such device as to its accuracy as well as to the accuracy of the test weights used in such test, and stating the date of such test, type of test and results of testing, shall be admissible when attested by one such inspector who executed and signed it as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of such testing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all violations of any weight limit as provided in this article or any permit issued in accordance with this article or with the Code of Virginia shall be processed in the following manner: 
(1)  The officer charging the violation shall serve a citation on the operator of the overweight vehicle. The citation shall be directed to the owner, operator, or other person responsible for the overweight violation as determined by the officer. Service of the citation on the vehicle operator shall constitute service of process upon the owner, operator, or other person charged with the weight violation. 
(2)  The officer charging the violation shall cause the citation to be delivered or mailed by first-class mail to the state department of transportation within 24 hours after it is served. 
(3)  The owner, operator, or other person charged with the weight violation shall, within 21 days after the citation is served upon the vehicle operator, either make full payment to the department of transportation of the civil penalty, liquidated damages, weighing fee, and processing fee as stated on the citation, or deliver to the department a written notice of his election to contest the overweight charge in court. 
(4)  Failure of the owner, operator, or other person charged with the weight violation to timely deliver to the department of transportation either payment in full of the uncontested civil penalty, liquidated damages, weighing fee, and processing fee or a notice of contest of the weight violation shall cause the department to issue an administrative order of assessment against such person. A copy of the order shall be sent by first-class mail to the person charged with the weight violation. Any such administrative order shall have the same effect as a judgment for liquidated damages entered by a general district court. 
(5)  Upon timely receipt of a notice of contest of an overweight charge, the department of transportation shall: 
a.  Forward the citation to the general district court named in the citation and 
b.  Send by first-class mail to the person charged with the weight violation, and to the officer who issued the citation, confirmation that the citation has been forwarded to the court for trial. 
(6)  Notices and pleadings may be served by first-class mail sent to the address shown on the citation as the address of the person charged with the weight violation or, if none is shown, to the address of record for the person to whom the vehicle is registered. 
(7)  An alleged weight violation that is contested shall be tried as a civil case. The attorney for the city shall represent the interests of the city. The disposition of the case shall be recorded in an appropriate order, a copy of which shall be sent to the department of transportation in lieu of any record that may be otherwise required by the Code of Virginia. If judgment is for the city, payment shall be made to the court and forwarded to the city treasurer and allocated to the fund appropriated for construction and maintenance of city streets.

Sec. 22-272. - Special overweight seizure provisions; penalty. 
(a)  Any law enforcement officer authorized to serve process or weigh vehicles under the provisions of this article may hold an overweight vehicle without an attachment summons or court order, but only for such time as is reasonably necessary to promptly petition for an attachment summons to attach the vehicle. 
(b)  After finding reasonable cause for the issuance of an attachment summons, the judicial officer conducting the hearing shall inform the operator of the vehicle of his option to either pay the liquidated damages, civil penalty, weighing fee, and processing fee, or contest the charge through the attachment proceeding. If the operator chooses to make payment, he shall do so to the judicial officer who shall transmit the citation, liquidated damages, civil penalty, weighing fee, and processing fee to the city treasurer for use by the city for the construction and maintenance of streets within the city. 
(c)  The city shall not be required to post bond in order to attach a vehicle pursuant to this section. The officer authorized to hold the overweight vehicle pending a hearing on the attachment petition shall also be empowered to execute the attachment summons if issued. Any bond for the retention of the vehicle or for release of the attachment shall be given in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 8.01-553 except that the bond shall be taken by a judicial officer. The judicial officer shall return the bond to the clerk of the appropriate court in place of the officer serving the attachment as otherwise provided in Code of Virginia, § 8.01-554. 
(d)  In the event the civil penalty, liquidated damages, weighing fee, and processing fee are not paid in full, or no bond is given by or for the person charged with the weight violation, the vehicle involved in the weight violation shall be stored in a secure place, as may be designated by the owner or operator of the vehicle. If no place is designated, the officer executing the attachment summons shall designate the place of storage. The owner or operator shall be afforded the right of unloading and removing the cargo from the vehicle. The risk and cost of the storage shall be borne by the owner or operator of the vehicle. 
(e)  Whenever an attachment summons is issued for a weight violation, the court shall forward to the state department of transportation both a copy of the order disposing of the case and the weight violation citation prepared by the officer but not served. 
(f)  Upon notification of the judgment or administrative order entered for such weight violation and notification of the failure of such person to satisfy the judgment or order, in addition to the state department of transportation, any law enforcement officer shall thereafter deny the offending person the right to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of the commonwealth until the judgment or order has been satisfied. 
(g)  When informed that the right to operate the motor vehicle has been denied, the driver shall drive the motor vehicle to a nearby location off the public highways and not move it or permit it to be moved until such judgment or order has been satisfied. Failure by the driver to comply with this provision shall constitute a class 4 misdemeanor. 
(h)  All costs incurred by the city and all judgments, if any, against the city due to action taken pursuant to this section shall be paid from the fund into which liquidated damages are paid. 
(i)  Police officers and all other law enforcement officers are vested with the same powers with respect to the enforcement of this article as they have with respect to the enforcement of the criminal laws of the city or of the commonwealth.

Except as provided by Code of Virginia, § 46.2-1138, such assessment shall be entered by the court or by the department of transportation as a judgment for the city, the entry of which shall constitute a lien upon the overweight vehicle. Except as provided by Code of Virginia, § 46.2-1138, such sums shall be paid to the department or collected by the attorney for the city and forwarded to the city treasurer and allocated to the fund appropriated for the construction and maintenance of city streets.

(a)  Except as otherwise provided, the maximum speed limits on highways of this city shall be as follows: 
(1)  Fifty-five miles per hour on the interstate system of highways or other limited access highways with divided roadways if the vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle, passenger bus, United States post office bus, pickup or panel truck or a motorcycle; and 55 miles per hour on such highways if the vehicle is a truck, road tractor, tractor-truck, or combination of vehicles designed to transport property, or is a motor vehicle being used to tow a vehicle designed for self-propulsion or a house trailer. 
(2)  Fifty-five miles per hour on nonlimited-access highways having four or more lanes if the vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle, passenger bus, United States post office bus, pickup or panel truck or a motorcycle; and 55 miles per hour on such highway if the vehicle is a truck, road tractor, tractor-truck, or combination of vehicles designed to transport property, or is a motor vehicle being used to tow a vehicle designed for self-propulsion or a house trailer, provided that for such highways such speed has been prescribed by the city manager after an engineering and traffic investigation. On any highway where such speed is prescribed, the speed shall be plainly indicated upon the highway by signs and, where the speed limit is indicated by posted signs, there shall be prima facie presumption that such engineering and traffic investigation was made. 
(3)  Fifty-five miles per hour on highways not included in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section if the vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle, passenger bus, United States post office bus, pickup or panel truck or a motorcycle; and 45 miles per hour on such highways if the vehicle is a truck, road tractor, tractor-truck, or combination of vehicles designed to transport property, or is a motor vehicle being used to tow a vehicle designed for self-propulsion or a house trailer. 
(4)  Thirty-five miles per hour on any highway other than an interstate highway if the vehicle is being used as a school bus to carry children and 45 miles per hour on interstate highways; provided, however, that for any such vehicle which neither takes on nor discharges children between its point of origin and point of destination, the speed limit shall be 45 miles per hour. 
(5)  Forty-five miles per hour on any highway if the vehicle or combination of vehicles is operating under a special permit issued by the state highway and transportation board in accordance with Code of Virginia, §§ 46.2-1112 and 46.2-1139. The state highway and transportation board may, however, prescribe a speed limit of less than 45 miles per hour on any permit issued in accordance with Code of Virginia, §§ 46.2-1112 and 46.2-1139. 
(6)  Twenty-five miles per hour between portable signs, tilt-over signs or fixed blinking signs placed in or along any highway bearing the word "school." Such word shall indicate that school children are present in the vicinity. Any signs erected under this subsection shall be placed not more than 300 feet from the limits of the school property or crossing in the vicinity of the school which is used by children going to and from the school; provided that such crossings are not more than 500 yards from the limits of the school property and the city council approves the crossing for such signs. It shall be the duty of the principal or chief administrative officer of each school or some responsible person designated by the school board, preferably not a classroom teacher, to place such portable signs in the highway at a point not more than 600 feet from the limits of the school property and remove such signs when their presence is no longer required by this subsection. Such portable signs, tilt-over signs or fixed blinking signs shall be placed in a position plainly visible to vehicular traffic approaching from either direction but shall not be placed so as to obstruct the roadway. Such portable signs, tilt-over signs or blinking signs shall be in a position or be turned on for 30 minutes preceding regular school hours and for 30 minutes thereafter and during such other times as the presence of children on such school property or going to and from school reasonably requires a special warning to motorists. 
(7)  Twenty-five miles per hour on highways in a business or residential district, except upon interstate or other limited-access highways with divided roadways. 
(8)  Thirty-five miles per hour on highways in the city, except upon interstate or other limited-access highways with divided roadways and except in business or residence districts. 
(9)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the speed limits for passenger motor vehicles while towing utility, camping or boat trailers not exceeding an actual gross weight of 2,500 pounds shall be the same as that for passenger motor vehicles. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the city manager may decrease the speed limits set forth in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section and may increase or decrease the speed limits set forth in subsections (a)(6) through (a)(8) of this section; and he may establish differentiated speed limits for daytime and nighttime by decreasing for nighttime driving the speed limits set forth in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section and by increasing for daytime or decreasing for nighttime the speed limits set forth in subsections (a)(6) through (a)(8) of this section. Such increased or decreased speed limits and such differentiated speed limits for daytime and nighttime driving shall be effective only when prescribed after a traffic engineer and traffic investigation and when indicated upon the highway by signs.

To permit. As used in subsection (g) of this section this phrase shall refer to that knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in his custody. This phrase is intended to provide an objective standard for parental responsibility, so as to require neglectful or careless parents to adhere to a reasonable community standard. 
(b)  Curfew for minors. It shall be a violation of this section for any minor 17 years of age and younger to be and remain in or upon any public place, including, but not limited to, any street, sidewalk, alley, playground, park or place of amusement in the city between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.

(3)  When the minor is engaging in the duties of bona fide employment or while traveling directly, without undue delay or detour from home to the place of employment or from the place of employment to the home. 
(4)  In cases of reasonable necessity the determination of reasonable necessity shall be made prior to any legal action by consulting the parents/guardians as soon as practicable. In determining reasonable necessity, consideration may be given to the fact that a minor is returning directly home and is in transit from an event or activity attendance which was authorized by his parent that was scheduled to end well before 11:00 p.m. and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the minor caused him to be out after 11:00 p.m. 
(5)  When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where he resides, or on the sidewalk of either next door neighbor if by the neighbor's permission. 
(6)  Inter/intrastate travel in motor vehicles. This is intended, from excess of caution, to exempt from regulation bona fide intrastate or interstate travel through, beginning and/or ending, in the city.

(1)  Where the minor is cooperative and provides a home address within the city, the officer may transport the minor to his home and release such minor to a responsible adult. A verbal warning shall be given to the parent, along with a copy of the curfew for minors ordinance. In the event the minor is released to the parent, it shall be evidenced by the parent's signature on a Portsmouth Police Department Youth Card. 
(2)  Where the minor resides outside the city limits, or no responsible adult can be contacted, the officer shall transport the minor to the police department. The officer will contact the on-call intake worker to facilitate placement of the minor for protective custody if the parent cannot be reached within a reasonable time. 
(3)  A record of this event containing a brief description of the circumstances shall be kept on file by the police department. 
(f)  Second or subsequent violation. Any minor, detained for a second or subsequent violation of this section within a 12-month period, shall be subject to any order of disposition authorized by Code of Virginia, § 16.1-278.4, entitled "children in need of services." 
(g)  Parental responsibility. It shall be unlawful for any parent to permit a minor to act in violation of the provisions of this section. It shall not be a defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. Upon the initial detention of any minor, notice of such violations along with a copy of the curfew for minors ordinance shall be given to the parents, either in person, or by certified mail. Upon a second or subsequent detention of any minor, the parent shall be charged with a violation of this section, and subject to the conditions and limitations as the court may order with respect to such child and the parents. Where the court finds a hearing that a parent has willfully contributed to, encouraged, or caused a violation of this section, that parent shall be guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. 
(h)  Severability. Severability is intended throughout and within this section.

(i)  Intent. The council enacts this section prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community standards, regulations for the conduct of minors in public places at night, for the good of minors, for the support and furtherance of the institution of the family, and for the general public good, safety and welfare. The council does not intend hereby to prohibit or interfere with any lawful activity. The council intends hereby to ensure that minors in public places at night after curfew are provided with reasonable adult supervision. The curfew for minors ordinance has been a significant factor in deterring juvenile delinquency in the past, and that it should now be updated and amplified in compliance with changes in the law and in response to increases in drug-related crime and crime in general. Our stability as a community is based on the institution of the family; that parental responsibility for the whereabouts of their children is the norm, and that legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility, because they encourage parent responsibility and decrease juvenile delinquency. The council is aware that proceedings before a juvenile and domestic relations court pursuant to this section constitute state offenses governed by Code of Virginia, § 16.1-278.6.

Unless a different meaning is required by the context, the following terms as used in this chapter shall have the meanings hereinafter respectively ascribed to them: 
Charitable organization means any organization which is or holds itself out to be organized or operated for any charitable purpose or any organization which solicits contributions from the public. This definition shall not be deemed to include: 
(1)  Any church or convention or association of churches, primarily operated for nonsecular purposes and no part of the net income of which inures to the direct benefit of any individual; 
(2)  Any political party as defined in Code of Virginia, § 24.2-101 or any political campaign committee or political action committee or other political committee required by state or federal law to file a report or statement of contributions and expenditures; 
(3)  Any authorized individual who solicits, by authority of such organization, solely on behalf of a registered or exempt charitable organization or on behalf of an organization excluded from the definition of charitable organization. 
Charitable purpose means any charitable, benevolent, humane, philanthropic, or eleemosynary purpose and the purposes of influencing legislation or influencing the actions of any public official or instigating, prosecuting or intervening in litigation. 
Charitable sales promotion means advertised sales that feature the names of both the commercial co-venturer and the charitable or civic organization and which state that the purchase or use of the goods, services, entertainment, or any other thing of value that the commercial co-venturer normally sells, will benefit the charitable or civic organization or its purposes. To qualify as a charitable sales promotion, the consumer must pay the same price for the thing of value as the commercial co-venturer usually charges without the charitable sales promotion and the consumer retains the thing of value. 
Civic organization means any local service club, veterans post, fraternal society or association, volunteer fire or rescue groups, or local civic league or association of ten or more persons not organized for profit but operated exclusively for educational or charitable purposes, including the promotion of community welfare, and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, recreational or social welfare purposes.

Federated fundraising organization means any federation of independent charitable organizations which have voluntarily joined together, including but not limited to United Fund or Community Chest, for the purposes of raising and distributing money for and among themselves and where membership does not confer operating authority and control of the individual agencies upon the federated group organization. 
Fundraising expenses means the expenses of all activities that constitute or are an integral and inseparable part of a solicitation. 
Membership means those persons to whom, for payment of fees, dues, assessments, and the like, an organization provides services and confers a bona fide right, privilege, professional standing, honor or other direct benefit, in addition to the right to vote, elect officers or hold offices.

A bona fide salaried officer or employee of a registered or exempt charitable organization or a registered parent organization shall not be deemed a professional solicitor. 
Sale, sell and sold mean the transfer of any property or the rendition of any service to any person in exchange for consideration, including any purported contribution without which such property would not have been transferred or such services would not have been rendered. 
Solicit and solicitation mean the request or appeal, directly or indirectly, for any contribution on the plea or representation that such contribution will be used for a charitable purpose, including without limitation, the following methods of requesting such contribution: 
(1)  Any oral or written request; 
(2)  Any announcement to the press, over the radio or television, or by telephone or telegraph concerning an appeal or campaign to which the public is requested to make a contribution for any charitable purpose connected therewith; 
(3)  The distribution, circulation, posting or publishing of any handbill, written advertisement or other publication which directly or by implication seeks to obtain public support; or

Creditable service means for any member, the most recent period of continuous service as an employee rendered by the member plus membership service for which credit is allowed under this chapter; provided, however, that periods before and after periods of unpaid authorized leave shall be included as creditable service but the period of leave itself shall not be credited as creditable service.

The allocation under this subsection shall be on the basis of the oldest-ages-first method.

(d)  The allocation of assets of the system provided for in subsection (c) of this section shall be carried out through the payment by the board of the benefits provided for in this section as they become due, or by the transfer of such assets to any retirement system replacing this system; provided that such vesting of benefits as provided by this section shall be fully maintained under such new retirement system. Any funds remaining in the assets of this system after all of the vested benefits provided by this section have been paid shall revert to the general fund.

Sec. 30-77. - Period of membership; cessation of membership. 
(a)  Each employee who becomes a member of the system shall continue to be a member so long as he remains an employee and so long thereafter as he is entitled to future benefits under any provision of the system. Not in limitation but in amplification of the foregoing, the membership of any person in the system shall cease: 
(1)  Upon his termination of service as an employee, other than by retirement, before he has become vested under the conditions as stated in section 30-116; provided however, that for the purposes of this section the entrance of a member into authorized leave of absence shall not constitute termination of service as an employee; provided the member reenters service as an employee at the expiration of the period of authorized leave, and the entrance of a member into the armed forces of the United States shall not constitute termination of service as an employee; provided the member's service in such armed forces qualifies as creditable service under section 30-99; 
(2)  Upon the cessation of his retirement allowance, unless in such event he immediately again becomes an employee; or 
(3)  Upon his death. 
(b)  Should any person terminate service as an employee other than by retirement under the provisions of this article, after he has completed the number of years of creditable service required for entitlement to benefits under section 30-116; and should such person at any time again become an employee, any benefits becoming payable under the provisions of this article shall be determined on the basis of the total creditable years of service combined for all such periods of employment. 
(c)  Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the membership of any person shall not cease by virtue of the fact that he became eligible for membership in the state supplemental retirement system upon employment by or transfer to the offices of the commissioner of the revenue or the city treasurer upon or within 60 days of July 1, 1959. The membership of any such person shall cease if his employment in the offices of the commissioner of the revenue or the city treasurer thereafter terminates for any reason other than death. 
(d)  Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the membership of any person shall not cease by virtue of the fact that he became eligible for membership in the state supplemental retirement system upon transfer of the department of public health of the city to the state health department effective July 1, 1960. The membership of any such person shall cease if his employment in the state health department thereafter terminates for any reason other than death, retirement or resignation to accept immediate employment with the city in a position covered by the provisions of this article. Service with the state health department by any such person shall be considered as creditable service under this article when determining eligibility for ordinary disability retirement, service connected disability retirement, and additional death benefits under sections 30-124 and 30-125, but such service shall not be considered as creditable service when computing allowances under this article. 
(e)  The retirement allowance payable to any member who retires pursuant to the provisions of subsection 30-116(a) and who returns to employment with the city shall not terminate upon re-employment. At the time of re-employment, the member shall become a member of the Virginia Retirement System, subject to the vesting and other requirements of that System.

(b)  Should a member die in service on or after July 1, 1977, who at any time has obtained a number of years of creditable service required for entitlement to benefits under the vesting provisions of section 30-116, from a cause not compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, there shall be paid a retirement allowance to the first of the following listed persons who shall survive the member and in the priority listed herein: 
(1)  Widow or widower, pension payable during widowhood. 
(2)  Child or children under the age of 18 years, pension payable to age 18 for each child. 
(3)  Dependent mother or father. 
(4)  Dependent sister or brother. 
If there is more than one child, or more than one dependent parent or more than one dependent sister or brother, the pension shall be divided in a manner as the board may determine. Parents, brothers or sisters must receive more than 50-percent support from the member in order to be considered dependent for the purposes of this pension. Payments to a child or children under the age of 18 years shall be made only to a court-appointed guardian or administrator of the estate of the member. Such retirement allowance shall be payable to the first eligible person as stipulated and shall be an allowance, unless subsection (c) of this section is applicable, equal to one-half of the retirement allowance that would have been payable to the member had the member retired under the provisions of section 30-119 on the date of his death after having elected to have his allowance payable under the joint and last survivor option described in section 30-128(a)(1). If the member is under the age of 55 at the date of death, it shall be assumed for the purpose of the one-half joint and last survivor option calculation that the member be age 55 at the date of his death. Such allowance shall be in addition to any benefits provided for in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Should a member become eligible for service retirement in accordance with section 30-116 but continue as an employee, the member may, on a form prescribed by the board, and in advance of retirement, make an election of a joint and last survivor option as described in section 30-128(a)(1). The designated fraction of the option shall be any amount greater than one-half or 50 percent and equal to or less than 100 percent. If a member having made such a designation shall die in service before retirement from a cause not compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act there shall be paid a retirement allowance to the widow or widower equal to the designated option percent of the allowance that would have been payable to the member had the member retired under the provisions of section 30-116 on the date of his death with the option so designated; or the amount as accorded in subsection (b) of this section, whichever is greater. Upon retirement of the member, the member's retirement allowance shall be calculated to include the election previously designated, unless such retirement is for disability. The retirement allowance to be continued after the member's death to the widow or widower shall be limited to a maximum of one-half of the deceased allowance received by the member during the member's lifetime. In making an election of an option as provided under this subsection, a member may also elect a modification of the joint and last survivor option whereby a provision is made for no decrease in allowance should the member's spouse die before the retirement of the member, or a return to an undecreased allowance should the member's spouse die before the member died during retirement. Such modification shall be determined by an actuarial report as of the retirement of the member. 
(Code 1973, § 31-270; Code 1988, § 30-124)  
Sec. 30-125. - Additional benefits before retirement for service-connected cause. 
(a)  Should a member die in service at any time before retirement from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, there shall be paid, in addition to any other benefits under this article, an annual allowance payable monthly to the widow of such member during her widowhood, if he leaves a widow, equal to one-half of the member's average final compensation. If he leaves no widow or the widow dies or remarries before the youngest child, if any, of the deceased member, has attained the age of 18 years, then such child or children, if any, under the age of 18 years, shall be paid such allowance until such child or children die or attain the age of 18 years, whichever shall first occur. If more than one child survives the deceased member, the allowance shall be divided among them in such manner as the board may determine. If the deceased member leaves neither widow nor child or children under the age of 18 years, then such allowance shall be paid to his parent wholly dependent upon him for support, divided in such manner as the board may determine, during the life of such parents; provided, however, that the amount of any allowance payable under his subsection shall be reduced by the amount of any social security benefits arising from coverage of the member under the Federal Social Security Act to which any such widow, child or parent may become entitled under the Federal Social Security Act, in effect at the member's death; and provided further, that if the total of the allowances payable under this subsection is less than the amount provided by section 30-124, the difference between such amount and such total shall be paid together with the last payment due under this subsection to the person entitled to receive the last payment. 
(b)  If neither widow, child or children nor wholly dependent parents survive such member, the benefits payable under this section shall be in the same amount and payable in the same manner as the benefits payable under section 30-124. 
(c)  The compensation awarded under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act for the death of such member shall be deducted from the benefit provided for in subsection (a) of this section, and the excess of the benefit, if any, shall be paid to the person specified in that subsection when the time for which payments of the compensation finally awarded under that act has elapsed, such person shall thereafter receive the full amount of the benefit payable as provided in that subsection. 
(Code 1973, § 31-271; Code 1988, § 30-125)  
Sec. 30-126. - Additional retirement benefits for judges of district courts. 
Every judge of the general district court or of the juvenile and domestic relations district court of this city who has attained the age of 70 years and has served for not less than ten years as a judge of any one or more of such courts and who retires or is retired from active service pursuant to the provisions of this article, upon such retirement, shall be paid in addition to any other benefits payable under this article a supplemental retirement allowance of $1,200.00 per year. The supplemental retirement allowance provided for in this section shall be paid in equal monthly installments. The payments provided herein shall be paid out of the general fund of the city and not out of the fund established by this article. The monies paid to such retired judges hereunder shall be deemed to be a gratuity and such payments shall cease at such time as the state shall provide a retirement system of such judges. 
(Code 1973, § 31-272; Code 1988, § 30-126)  
Sec. 30-127. - Death benefits after retirement or disability. 
(a)  Should a member who retired prior to July 1, 1967, die at any time after retirement but before receiving total retirement allowances provided in this article at least equal to his accumulated contributions as of his date of retirement, the difference between such accumulated contributions and such total allowances shall then be payable in a lump sum in accordance with section 30-129, unless the retirement allowance is then being paid in accordance with any of the option contained in section 30-128, as in effect at his date of retirement. 
(b)  Should a member who had at least one year of creditable service die after termination of service and before his normal retirement date, after having been continuously disabled from date of termination of service to date of death to such an extent that he would have qualified for disability retirement in accordance with section 30-118 or section 30-120 without regard to any creditable service requirements or actual retirement thereunder, provided that written notification of such disability is given to the board by the member, his employer or his beneficiary designated as provided in section 30-129 within one year after the member's termination of service, an additional benefit equal to $1,000.00 shall be payable in a lump sum in accordance with section 30-129. 
(Code 1973, § 31-273; Code 1988, § 30-127)  
Sec. 30-128. - Optional benefits. 
(a)  Each member who retires under any of the provisions of this article shall have the right at any time, not subsequent to the later of the effective date of the member's retirement or the date of the written notification to the board of the retirement of the member, to elect to have his retirement allowance payable under any one of the applicable options set forth in this section in lieu of the retirement allowance that would otherwise be payable to him. The member shall make any such election by written request to the board and such election shall be subject to the approval of the board. 
(1)  Joint and last survivor option. The member shall be provided a 50 percent spousal option at no cost to the member calculated on a spousal age difference of no younger than five years of the member. If the spouse is more than five years younger than the member, the member may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during his lifetime which represents the additional cost for a member's spouse who is younger than five years of the member. The member may also elect to receive a decreased allowance during his lifetime based on the additional cost of 75 percent or 100 percent spousal option. If the member's retirement is for disability, the retirement allowance to be continued after the member's death shall be limited to a maximum of one-half of the retirement allowance received by the member during his lifetime. 
A member retired prior to July 1, 1992, who at date of retirement elected a spousal option, shall receive an increase in pension equal to the cost of a 50 percent spousal option calculated on a spousal age difference of no younger than five years of the member. 
An unmarried member shall upon marriage, be provided a 50 percent spousal option, calculated on a spousal age difference of no younger than five years of the member provided that the member submit written notification to the board within 90 days after the marriage, and provided that evidence satisfactory to the board of the good health of the retired member is submitted with the notification. 
(2)  Social security option. If a member retires prior to his normal retirement date, he may elect to receive an increased retirement allowance up to his normal retirement date and a decreased retirement allowance thereafter, thereby providing a more nearly level retirement income when such decreased retirement allowance is added to his anticipated primary benefits under the social security act. 
(3)  Other options. The member may elect some other combination of benefits to the member and/or to such other beneficiary as the member shall designate, provided, however, that if the member's retirement is for disability, the election of the requirement allowance to be continued after the member's death should be limited to a maximum of one-half of the decreased retirement allowance received by the member during his lifetime. 
(b)  The election of a member of any one of the options stated in this section shall be null and void if the member dies prior to retirement, and the election by a member of the joint and last survivor option shall be null and void if the designated beneficiary dies before the member has retired. 
(c)  A member who has elected any one of the options stated in this section may, at any time prior to the later of the effective date of the member's retirement or the date of written notification to the board of retirement of the member, revoke such an election by written notification to the board. 
(d)  A retired member who has elected or has been provided a joint and last survivor option, may by written notification to the board, elect a different spousal recipient if the following occurs: (1) the original spousal recipient has died; or (2) a final decree of divorce of the retired member from the original spousal recipient has been entered permitting the revocation of the joint and last survivor option; (3) evidence satisfactory to the board of the good health of the retired member is submitted with the notification; and (4) the notification to the board of the change in election occurs within 90 days of the occurrence of one or two or within 90 days after remarriage. Except as provided above, if the provisions of this subsection are invoked by a retired member on the basis of the member having been divorced from his former spousal recipient and the marriage had been of a duration of 20 years or more, the provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable until the death or remarriage of the former spouse unless such spouse consents in writing to the revocation. If such an election is made as a result of the death or divorce of the spousal recipient, the benefit payable to the retired member may be adjusted retroactively for a period of not more than 30 days from the date the board first receives notification of the member's election to make such a change.

Sec. 30-129. - Payment of death benefits. 
All lump sum payments falling due under this article upon the death of a member or former member shall be paid to such person, if any, as the member shall have designated to be the beneficiary thereof, otherwise to the executors or administrators of the member. Any such beneficiary designation shall be made in writing and filed with the board in such manner as may be required by the board. Any such designation may be changed from time to time by the member by his filing with the board a new written designation.

Once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance and at least once in every three-year period thereafter, the board may require any such member prior to his normal retirement date to undergo a medical examination by the examiner. Should such a member refuse to submit to undergo a medical examination by the examiner, his retirement allowance shall be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal continue for one year, all his rights to any further disability allowance shall cease. 
(Code 1973, § 31-276; Code 1988, § 30-130)  
Sec. 30-131. - Reduction of disability retirement allowance. 
(a)  Whenever a member receiving a disability retirement allowance subsequently becomes engaged in gainful occupation, the disability allowance shall be reduced by the amount of income received which exceeds the difference between the disability retirement allowance and the amount of wages or salary the member would have been entitled to had his employment progressed in the same range and grade with credit for the level of seniority he would have attained had he not been disabled. Such reduction in disability retirement allowance shall continue until his retirement date. 
(b)  Should the examiner report and certify to the board at any time that any member receiving a disability retirement allowance is able to engage in gainful occupation paying an amount equal to or more than his average final compensation as described in subsection (a) of this section and should the board find that such member shall have refused any employment considered by the board suitable to his capacity, he shall not be entitled to any such allowance during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the option of the board, such refusal was justified. 
(c)  At least once each year during the first five years following retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and at least once in every two-year period thereafter, the board shall require any such member, prior to his normal retirement date, to submit to the secretary of the board such information as the board may deem appropriate concerning any gainful employment, and the compensation therefor, in which the member may be participating or in which the member may have participated subsequent to his retirement from service. In addition to the foregoing requirement, any member on a disability retirement allowance shall, within 30 days of obtaining employment report to the secretary of the board the date and place of such employment and the amount of earnings. Should such member 
refuse to submit the information as directed by this section, his retirement allowance shall be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal continue for a period of one year, all his rights to any further disability allowance shall cease. Should the board determine that an overpayment of a disability allowance has been made, such overpayment shall be corrected by a suspension of all or a part of the disability allowance for such period of time as may be necessary to complete such repayment.

Sec. 30-132. - Cessation of disability retirement allowance. 
Should any member receiving a disability retirement allowance be at any time prior to his normal retirement date in service, his disability retirement allowance shall cease and he shall thereafter resume his active membership in the system. Any service on the basis of which his disability retirement allowance was computed shall thereafter be counted as creditable service and in addition, the period of disability retirement shall be counted as creditable service.

Sec. 30-135. - Limitation on creditable compensation taken into account. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, except in the case of an employee who first became a member before July 1, 1996, creditable compensation taken into account for purposes of determining benefits under the system shall be limited by the compensation limit pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For purposes of applying the limitation applicable to each year, the limit for a plan year shall be the limitation in effect for the calendar year in which the plan year begins determined without increases in the limitation for subsequent years. An employee who first became a member before July 1, 1996 shall be considered a grandfathered employee for purposes of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(Ord. No. 2016-89 , § 12, 11-22-2016)  
Sec. 30-136. - Limitation on annual benefit and special vesting rules. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the annual benefit under the system of any member and any related death or other benefit shall, if necessary, be reduced to the extent required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, all as applicable to governmental plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, adjustments in the dollar limitation under Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall only be applicable to benefits provided by this system with respect to a member who is an eligible employee at the time the adjustment is effective. In comparing the system benefit to the dollar limitation, system benefits must be converted to an annual benefit (as defined in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) by, except as provided below, converting a benefit payable in a form other than a straight life annuity to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity before applying the limitations of this section. The annual benefit does not include any benefits attributable to employee contributions or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not maintained by a participating employer. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit is required for (i) the value of a joint and survivor annuity, (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as the qualified disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits), and (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Inc. Tax Regs. Section 1.415-3(c)(2)(iii). Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations thereunder are hereby incorporated by reference. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the applicable actuarial adjustment factors shall be based on the following assumptions: 
(1)  Mortality according to the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, the 1994 Group Annuity Reserving Table (94 GAR). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the mortality table used for this purpose shall automatically be the table specified in any future revenue rulings or federal regulations that amend or supersede Revenue Ruling 2001-62 by specifying a new mortality table for this purpose; and 
(2)  Interest at the rate prescribed in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations and other guidance published thereunder. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a member shall be fully vested in his retirement allowance upon the attainment of his normal retirement date. 
(Ord. No. 2016-89 , § 12, 11-22-2016)  
Sec. 30-137. - Required minimum distributions. 
On and after January 1, 1989, the retirement allowance of a member who has terminated employment shall begin no later than the later of (i) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year that the member attains seventy and one-half years of age or (ii) April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member terminates employment. If the member fails, following reasonable notification, to elect a form of payment by such required beginning date, the retirement allowance shall be paid as a single life annuity. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including as such section is amended or renumbered, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans are incorporated by reference. 
(Ord. No. 2016-89 , § 12, 11-22-2016)  
Sec. 30-138. - Rollover rules. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. The terms "eligible rollover distribution", "eligible retirement plan" and "distributee" have the meanings prescribed by Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code (including as such section is amended or renumbered, or any successor provision thereto) and the regulations thereunder, as may be amended. Such terms shall include non-spouse designated beneficiaries and inherited individual retirement accounts in accordance with Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code (as such section may be amended or renumbered, or any successor provision thereto) and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans. In the event of a mandatory cash-out, as that term is defined under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans, greater than $1,000, if the member does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member in a direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with this section, then the board shall pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the board that satisfies the safe harbor provision of Code of Virginia, § 51.1-124.30.F, and such provisions shall be interpreted and administered in accordance therewith. 
(Ord. No. 2016-89 , § 12, 11-22-2016)  
Sec. 30-139. - Military service. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). 
(b)  To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the following special rules shall apply in case of reemployed veterans notwithstanding the provisions of the system: 
(1)  A reemployed veteran shall not be considered to have incurred a break in service by reason of his qualified military service. 
(2)  Qualified military service of a reemployed veteran shall be counted as service for vesting under the plan. 
(c)  To the extent required by USERRA or Section 401(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of determining vesting in accrued benefits and entitlement to death benefits under the system, in the event a member ceases to be an employee in order to perform qualified military service and dies on or after January 1, 2007 while performing qualified military service, the member's death shall be considered to have occurred while he was an employee and, if he ceased to be an eligible employee in order to perform qualified military service, while he was an eligible employee so that his beneficiaries are entitled to any additional benefits provided under the system (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service unless otherwise expressly provided), including without limitation any additional or enhanced vesting or death benefits, had the member resumed employment with the participating employer and then terminated employment on account of death. 
(d)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following meanings: 
(1)  Qualified military service means any service in the uniformed services (as defined in Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States Code) by any individual if such individual is entitled to reemployment rights under such chapter with respect to such service and to the employer. 
(2)  Reemployed veteran means a person who is or, but for his qualified military service, would have been a member at some time during his qualified military service and who is entitled to the restoration benefits and protections of the USERRA with respect to his qualified military service and the system.

The accrued liability contribution shall be the dollar amount determined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  The normal contribution rate shall be defined as the percentage of the total annual creditable compensation of the members that is represented by the annual normal cost required to provide the benefits of the system, other than any future adjustments as provided for in section 30-122, computed in accordance with the recognized actuarial principles on the basis of methods and assumptions approved by the board. 
(c)  The accrued liability contribution shall be defined as the level annual contribution necessary to amortize the then remaining unfunded accrued liability over a period as follows:

(d)  The normal contribution rate and the accrued liability contribution shall be determined from the results of each valuation of the system using the actuarial basis adopted by the board and shall continue in force until a new valuation is made. The accrued liability contribution shall be adjusted each year based on the amount of the adjustment approved by the city council for that year using the actuarial basis adopted by the board. 
(e)  The board shall certify to the city manager the normal contribution rate and the accrued liability contribution and every change made therein from time to time. 
(f)  The aggregate employer contribution for any year shall be at least sufficient, when combined with the amount then held in the retirement account, to provide the benefits payable from the account during the current year.

(c)  In the event of repeal as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the assets of the system shall be allocated by the board in an equitable manner to provide benefits for the persons designated in subsection (b) of this section in accordance with the provisions of this article but based on years of creditable service and average final compensation as of the date of repeal and in the following order: 
(1)  For the benefit of the then members not yet retired to the extent of their accumulated contributions, if any. If any funds remain, then 
(2)  For the benefit of the retired members and the then beneficiaries entitled to receive benefits hereunder and beneficiaries already designated under the joint and last survivor option provided for in this article by the then retired members, to the extent of the then actuarial value of their allowances. If any funds remain, then 
(3)  For the benefit of members not then retired and beneficiaries, if any, designated by the members under the joint and last survivor option provided for in this article, to the extent, not provided under subsection (c)(1) of this section, of the then actuarial value of their accrued retirement allowances, based on years of creditable service and average final compensation as of the date of repeal. The allocation under this subsection shall be on the basis of the oldest-ages-first method. 
In the event the assets at such date of repeal are insufficient to provide all of the benefits of subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section or both, then the employer will contribute to the assets from time to time, as and when required, the amount necessary to make up such insufficiency. 
(d)  The allocation of assets of the system provided for in subsection (c) of this section shall be carried out through the payment by the board of the benefits provided for in this section as they become due, or by the transfer of such assets to any retirement system replacing this system; provided, that such vesting of benefits as provided by this section shall be fully maintained under such new retirement system. Any funds remaining in the assets of this system after all of the vested benefits provided by this section have been paid shall revert to the general fund. 
(e)  Any allocation of assets made in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be final and binding on all persons entitled to benefits under such provisions. 
(f)  Upon the termination or partial termination of the system, each member shall become fully vested, as of the termination date or partial termination date, in his service retirement allowance to the extent funded, regardless of length of service or amount of creditable service.

Editor's note It should be noted that §§ 2, 3 of Ord. No. 2008-42 provide, 
"2. That the purpose of this ordinance is to correct a clerical error in Ordinance 1994-40, adopted on May 10, 1994, amending Section 30-237. That ordinance incorrectly referred to Code sections 30-119, 30-121, 30-122, 30-124, 30-125 and 30-127 that govern the Portsmouth Supplemental Retirement System when it authorized a service retirement allowance for members of the Portsmouth Fire and Police Retirement System. The purpose of this ordinance is also to confirm that, for the Portsmouth Fire and Police Retirement System, a service retirement allowance was always intended to be paid only to service retirees, and not to any other class of retirees. City Council hereby finds that the uniform practice of the Board of Trustees administering the Portsmouth Fire and Police Retirement System both before and after enactment of said ordinance has been to pay a service retirement allowance only to service retirees in the Portsmouth Fire and Police Retirement System and not to any other retirees in said system. Said practice is hereby affirmed and ratified as being consistent with the correct legislative intent of Ordinance 1994-40, and any possible contrary interpretation of said ordinance is specifically found to be inconsistent with the legislative intent of Portsmouth City Council. The purpose of this ordinance is conform the text of Section 20-237 to what has always been the legislative intent, and to conform it to what has been the uniform practice of the Board of Trustees in interpreting and applying said code section." 
"3. That, because this ordinance is adopted to correct a clerical error, the provisions adopted herein are deemed to have taken effect on May 10, 1994, the date of adoption of Ordinance 1994-40."  
Sec. 30-238. - Ordinary disability retirement.

(1)  That such member is or has been continuously since such effective date, if prior to the filing of such notice, mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty. 
(2)  That such incapacity is likely to be permanent. 
(3)  That such member should be retired. 
(b)  For good cause shown, the board may waive the 90-day period set forth in subsection (a) of this section relating to the period following the termination of service. For purposes of this section, good cause shall exist and the board shall waive such notification period if: (i) the member would otherwise qualify for disability retirement but for failing to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, and (ii) the medical examiner, acting solely in his own discretion after reviewing objective medical evidence of the disability and its cause, certifies that: (a) the disability and its cause existed on the date the member's employment was terminated, (b) the member had no knowledge of the existence of the disability and its cause at any time within 90 days after the date the member's employment was terminated, and (c) the member could not, with reasonable inquiry, have ascertained the existence of the disability within 90 days after the date the member's employment was terminated.

(a)  Upon retirement as provided in section 30-238, a member shall receive an annual retirement allowance, payable at least monthly to him during his lifetime and continued disability, in an amount equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of his "disability credited service," as hereinafter defined. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, the term "disability credited service" for any member shall be taken to mean the smallest of: 
(1)  Twice the member's actual period of creditable service; 
(2)  The member's period of creditable service plus ten years; 
(3)  The number of years of creditable service the member would have completed at his normal retirement date if he had remained in service as an employee until then; if the member is past his normal retirement date disability credited service shall be equal to the member's actual creditable service; 
(4)  Twenty years; if the member's actual creditable service is greater than 20 years, "disability credited service" shall be equal to the member's actual creditable service. An allowance shall be payable to the member according to subsection (a) of this section and an additional two percent for each year of creditable service for the next five years and an additional one percent for each year thereafter. 
(c)  The foregoing provisions to the contrary notwithstanding, if a member's retirement allowance is payable under one of the options of section 30-247, the amount and duration thereof shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable option.

(a)  Any member, in service or within 90 days after termination of service, may retire on account of disability compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act upon written notification to the board, made by the member or his employer, setting forth at what time the retirement is to become effective; provided, that such effective date shall be after the last day of service and after the date the award of compensation under that act becomes final, but shall not be more than 90 days prior to the date of such notification; and provided further, the examiner, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify: 
(1)  That such member is, and has been continuously since such effective date, if prior to the filing of such notice, mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty. 
(2)  That such incapacity is likely to be permanent. 
(3)  That such member should be retired. 
(b)  For good cause shown, the board may waive the 90-day period set forth in subsection (a) of this section relating to the period following the termination of service. For purposes of this section, good cause shall exist and the board shall waive such notification period if: (i) the member would otherwise qualify for disability retirement but for failing to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, and (ii) the medical examiner, acting solely in his own discretion after reviewing objective medical evidence of the disability and its cause, certifies that: (a) the disability and its cause existed on the date the member's employment was terminated, (b) the member had no knowledge of the existence of the disability and its cause at any time within 90 days after the date the member's employment was terminated, and (c) the member could not, with reasonable inquiry, have ascertained the existence of the disability within 90 days after the date the member's employment was terminated.

(2)  The allowance to which the member would be entitled under the provisions of section 30-239 if his disability were not compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act. 
(b)  The foregoing provisions to the contrary notwithstanding, if a member's retirement allowance is payable under one of the options of section 30-247, the amount and duration thereof shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable option. 
(c)  The compensation finally awarded to the member under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act or adjusted pursuant to that act shall be deducted from any allowance becoming payable under the provisions of this section, and the excess of the allowance, if any, shall be paid to the member. When the time for payments of compensation under such act has elapsed, the member shall thereafter receive the full amount of such allowance payable at least monthly during his lifetime and continued disability. 
(d)  Beginning July 1, 2006, and thereafter, in order to receive a service-connected disability retirement allowance, a member retiring on account of disability compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act shall participate in vocational rehabilitation following his or her release for light-duty occupations.

Such adjustments shall be subject to the same conditions of payment as are applicable to the retirement allowance. In no case, shall the operation of this section result in a reduction in the amount of any person's total benefit below the amount of the retirement allowance that would have been payable in the absence of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall city council approve or authorize adjustments to retirement allowances unless the Portsmouth Fire and Police Retirement System is funded at no less than 80 percent of the actuarial accrued liability. 
(Code 1973, § 31-155; Code 1988, § 30-243; Ord. No. 1988-21, § 2, 2-23-1988; Ord. No. 2019-74 , § 2(Exh. A), 10-22-2019)  
Sec. 30-244. - Ordinary death benefits. 
(a)  Should a member, who had one or more years of creditable service, die in service at any time before retirement from a cause not comprehensible under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, an additional benefit equal to $5,000.00 shall then be payable in a lump sum in accordance with section 30-248. 
(b)  If the member at the date of death had more than five years of creditable service, there shall be paid a retirement allowance to the first of the following-listed persons who shall survive the member and in the priority listed herein: 
(1)  Widow or widower, pension payable during widowhood. 
(2)  Child or children under the age of 18 years, pension payable to age 18 for each child. 
(3)  Dependent mother or father. 
(4)  Dependent sister or brother. 
If there is more than one child, or more than one dependent parent, or more than one dependent sister or brother, the pension shall be divided in a manner as the board may determine. Parents, brothers or sisters must receive more than 50-percent support from the member in order to be considered dependent for the purposes of this pension. Payments to a child or children under the age of 18 years shall be made only to a court-appointed guardian or administrator of the estate of the member. 
Such retirement allowance shall be payable to the first eligible person as stipulated and be an allowance, unless subsection (c) of this section is applicable, payable at least monthly, equal to the larger of $1,200.00 a year, or equal to one-half the retirement allowance that would have been payable to the member had the member retired under the provisions of section 30-239 on the date of his death after having elected to have his allowance payable under the joint and last survivor option described in section 30-247(a)(1). If the member is under the age of 55 at the date of death, it shall be assumed for the purpose of the one-half joint and last survivor option calculation that the member be age 55 at the date of his death. 
Such allowance shall be in addition to any benefits provided for in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Should a member become eligible for service retirement in accordance with section 30-236 but continue as an employee, the member may, on a form proscribed by the board, and in advance of retirement, make an election of a joint and last survivor option as described in section 30-247(a)(1). The designated fraction of the option shall be any amount greater than one-half or 50 percent and equal to or less than 100 percent. If a member having made such a designation shall die in service before retirement from a cause not compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act there shall be paid a retirement allowance to the widow or widower equal to the designated option percent of the allowance that would have been payable to the member had the member retired under the provisions of section 30-236 on the date of his death with the option so designated; or the amount as accorded in subsection (b) of this section, whichever is greater. Upon retirement of the member, the member's retirement allowance shall be calculated to include the election previously designated, unless such retirement is for disability. The retirement allowance to be continued after the member's death to the widow or widower shall be limited to a maximum of one-half of the deceased allowance received by the member during the member's lifetime. In making an election of an option as provided under this subsection, a member may also elect a modification of the joint and last survivor option whereby a provision is made for no decrease in allowance should the member's spouse die before the retirement of the member, or a return to an undecreased allowance should the member's spouse die before the member died during retirement. Such modification shall be determined by an actuarial report as of the retirement of the member. 
(Code 1973, § 31-156; Code 1988, § 30-244)  
Sec. 30-245. - Additional death benefits before retirement for service-connected cause. 
(a)  Should a member die in service at any time before retirement from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, there shall be paid, in addition to any other benefits under this article, an annual allowance payable monthly to the widow of such member during her widowhood if he leaves a widow, equal to one-half of the member's average final compensation. If he leaves no widow or the widow dies or remarries before the youngest child, if any, of the deceased member has attained the age of 18 years, such child, or children, if any, under the age of 18 years, shall be paid such allowance until such child or children die or attain the age of 18 years, whichever shall first occur. If more than one child survives the deceased member, the allowance shall be divided among them in such manner as the board may determine. If the deceased member leaves neither widow nor child or children under the age of 18 years, then such allowance shall be paid to his parents wholly dependent upon him for support, divided in such manner as the board may determine, during the life or lives of such parents; provided, however, if the total of the allowance payable under this subsection is less than the amount provided by section 30-244, the difference between such amount and such total shall be paid together with the last payment due under this subsection to the person entitled to receive such last payment. 
(b)  If neither widow, child, children nor wholly dependent parent survive such member, the benefits payable under this section shall be in the same amount and payable in the same manner as the benefits payable under section 30-244. 
(c)  The compensation finally awarded under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act for the death of such member shall be deducted from the benefit provided for in subsection (a) of this section, and the excess of the benefit, if any, shall be paid to the person specified in that subsection. When the time for which payments of the compensation finally awarded under that act has elapsed, such person shall thereafter receive the full amount of the benefit payable as provided in this subsection. 
(Code 1973, § 31-157; Code 1988, § 30-245)  
Sec. 30-246. - Death benefits after retirement or disability. 
(a)  Should a member who retired prior to July 1, 1967, die at any time after retirement but before receiving total retirement allowances provided for in this chapter at least equal to his accumulated contributions as of his date of retirement, the difference between such accumulated contributions and such total allowances shall then be payable in a lump sum in accordance with section 30-248 unless the retirement allowance is then being paid in accordance with any of the options contained in section 30-247, as in effect at his date of retirement. 
(b)  Should a member who had at least one year of creditable service die after termination of service and before his normal retirement date, after having been continuously disabled from date of termination of service to date of death to such an extent that he would have qualified for disability retirement in accordance with section 30-238 or section 30-240, without regard to any creditable service requirements or actual retirement thereunder, provided that written notification of such disability is given to the board by the member, his employer or his beneficiary designated as provided in section 30-248 within one year after the member's termination of service, an additional benefit equal to $1,000.00 shall be payable in a lump sum in accordance with section 30-248. 
(Code 1973, § 31-158; Code 1988, § 30-246)

(a)  Each member who retires under any of the provisions of this article shall have the right at any time, not subsequent to the later of the effective date of the member's retirement or the date of the written notification to the board of the retirement of the member, to elect to have his retirement allowance payable under any one of the options set forth in this section in lieu of the retirement allowance that would otherwise be payable to him. The amount of such optional retirement allowance shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the retirement allowance that would otherwise be payable to him. The member shall make any such election by written request to the board and such election shall be subject to the approval of the board. 
(1)  Joint and last survivor option. The member shall be provided a 50 percent spousal option at no cost to the member calculated on a spousal age difference of no younger than five years of the member. If the spouse is more than five years younger than the member, the member may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during his lifetime which represents the additional cost for a member's spouse who is younger than five years of the member. The member may also elect to receive a decreased allowance during his lifetime based on the additional cost of 75 percent or 100 percent spousal option. If the member's retirement is for disability, the retirement allowance to be continued after the member's death shall be limited to a maximum of one-half of the retirement allowance received by the member during his lifetime. 
A member retired prior to July 1, 1992, who at date of retirement elected a spousal option, shall receive an increase in pension equal to the cost of a 50 percent spousal option calculated on a spousal age difference of no younger than five years of the member. 
An unmarried member shall upon marriage, be provided a 50 percent spousal option, calculated on a spousal age difference of no younger than five years of the member provided that the member submit written notification to the board within 90 days after the marriage, and provided that evidence satisfactory to the board of the good health of the retired member is submitted with the notification. 
(2)  Other options. The member may elect some other combination of benefits to the member and/or to such other beneficiary as the member shall designate, provided, however, that if the member's retirement is for disability, the election of the retirement allowance to be continued after the member's death should be limited to a maximum of one-half of the decreased retirement allowance received by the member during his lifetime. 
(b)  The election by a member of any one of the options stated in this section shall be null and void if the member dies prior to retirement, and the election by a member of the joint and last survivor option shall be null and void if the designated beneficiary dies before the member has retired. 
(c)  A member who has elected any one of the options stated in this section may, at any time prior to the later of the effective date of the member's retirement or the date of written notification to the board of retirement of the member, revoke such an election by written notification to the board. 
(d)  A retired member who has elected or has been provided a joint and last survivor option, may by written notification to the board, elect a different spousal recipient if the following occurs: (1) the original spousal recipient has died; or (2) a final decree of divorce of the retired member from the original spousal recipient has been entered permitting the revocation of the joint and last survivor option; (3) evidence satisfactory to the board of the good health of the retired member is submitted with the notification; and (4) the notification to the board of the change in election occurs within 90 days of the occurrence of one or two or within 90 days after remarriage. Except as provided above, if the provisions of this subsection are invoked by a retired member on the basis of the member having been divorced from his former spousal recipient and the marriage had been of a duration of 20 years or more, the provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable until the death or remarriage of the former spouse unless such spouse consents in writing to the revocation. If such an election is made as a result of the death or divorce of the spousal recipient, the benefit payable to the retired member may be adjusted retroactively for a period of not more than 30 days from the date the board first receives notification of the member's election to make such a change.

Sec. 30-248. - Payment of death benefits. 
All lump sum payments falling due under this article upon the death of a member or former member shall be paid to such person, if any, as the member shall have designated to the beneficiary thereof, otherwise to the executors or administrators of the member. Any such beneficiary designation shall be made in writing and filed with the board in such manner as may be required by the board. Any such designation may be changed from time to time by the member by his filing with the board a new written designation.

Sec. 30-249. - Medical examinations of beneficiary of disability retirement allowance. 
Once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and at least once in every three-year period thereafter, the board may require any such member prior to his normal retirement date to undergo a medical examination by the examiner. Should such a member refuse to submit to any such medical examination, his retirement allowance shall be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal and should such refusal continue for one year, all his rights to any further disability allowance shall cease. 
(Code 1973, § 31-161; Code 1988, § 30-249)  
Sec. 30-250. - Reduction of disability retirement allowance. 
(a)  Whenever a member receiving a disability retirement allowance subsequently becomes engaged in gainful occupation, the disability allowance shall be reduced by the amount of income received which exceeds the difference between the disability retirement allowance and the amount of wages or salary the member would have been entitled to had his employment progressed in the same range and grade with credit for the level of seniority he would have attained had he not been disabled. Such reduction in disability retirement allowance shall continue until his normal retirement date. For the purposes of this section "income" means gross income received less deductions for social security taxes only. 
(b)  Should the examiner report and certify to the board at any time that any member receiving a disability retirement allowance is able to engage in gainful occupation paying an amount equal to or more than his average final compensation as described in subsection (a) of this section and should the board find that such member shall have refused any employment considered by the board suitable to his capacity, he shall not be entitled to any such allowance during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the option of the board, such refusal was justified. 
(c)  At least once each year during the first five years following retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and at least once in every two-year period thereafter, the board shall require any such member, prior to his normal retirement date, to submit to the secretary of the board such information as the board may deem appropriate concerning any gainful employment, and the compensation therefor, in which the member may be participating or in which the member may have participated subsequent to his retirement from service. In addition to the foregoing requirement, any member on a disability retirement allowance shall within 30 days of obtaining employment, report to the secretary of the board the date and place of such employment and the amount of earnings. Should such member refuse to submit the information as directed by this section, his retirement allowance shall be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal continue for a period of one year, all his rights to any further disability allowance shall cease. Should the board determine that an overpayment of a disability allowance has been made, such overpayment shall be corrected by a suspension of all or a part of the disability allowance for such period of time as may be necessary to complete such repayment.

Any service on the basis of which his disability retirement allowance was computed shall thereafter be counted as creditable service, and, in addition, the period of disability retirement shall be counted as creditable service. 
(Code 1973, § 31-163; Code 1988, § 30-251)

Should any change or error in records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, then on discovery of any such error the board shall correct the same, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, adjustments in the dollar limitation under Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall only be applicable to benefits provided by this system with respect to a member who is an eligible employee at the time the adjustment is effective. In comparing the system benefit to the dollar limitation, system benefits must be converted to an annual benefit (as defined in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) by, except as provided below, converting a benefit payable in a form other than a straight life annuity to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity before applying the limitations of this section. The annual benefit does not include any benefits attributable to employee contributions or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not maintained by a participating employer. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit is required for (i) the value of a joint and survivor annuity, (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as the qualified disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits), and (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Inc. Tax Regs. Section 1.415-3(c)(2)(iii). Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations thereunder are hereby incorporated by reference. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the applicable actuarial adjustment factors shall be based on the following assumptions:

If the member fails, following reasonable notification, to elect a form of payment by such required beginning date, the retirement allowance shall be paid as a single life annuity. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including as such section is amended or renumbered, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans are incorporated by reference. 
(Ord. No. 2016-89 , § 21, 11-22-2016)

The terms "eligible rollover distribution", "eligible retirement plan" and "distributee" have the meanings prescribed by Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code (including as such section is amended or renumbered, or any successor provision thereto) and the regulations thereunder, as may be amended. Such terms shall include non-spouse designated beneficiaries and inherited individual retirement accounts in accordance with Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code (as such section may be amended or renumbered, or any successor provision thereto) and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans. In the event of a mandatory cash-out, as that term is defined under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans, greater than $1,000, if the member does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member in a direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with this section, then the board shall pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the board that satisfies the safe harbor provision of Code of Virginia, § 51.1-124.30.F, and such provisions shall be interpreted and administered in accordance therewith.

(d)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following meanings: 
(1)  Qualified military service means any service in the uniformed services (as defined in Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States Code) by any individual if such individual is entitled to reemployment rights under such chapter with respect to such service and to the employer.

Sec. 31.2-5. - Stormwater pollution prevention plan; contents of plan. 
(a)  The stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) must comply with the requirements and general information set forth in Section 9VAC-25-880-70, of Section II [stormwater pollution prevention plan] of the general permit. The SWPPP shall also include the content specified by Section 9VAC-25-870-54, as follows: 
(1)  An approved erosion and sediment control plan, an approved stormwater management plan, a pollution prevention plan for regulated land disturbing activities, and a description of any additional control measure necessary to address a TMDL pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
a.  An erosion and sediment control plan consistent with the requirements of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law and regulations must be designed prior to and implemented during construction activities. Prior to land disturbance, this plan must be approved by either the city or the department in accordance with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law and attendant regulations. 
b.  A stormwater management plan consistent with the requirements of the Virginia Stormwater Management Act and regulations must be designed prior to and implemented during construction activities. Prior to land disturbance, this plan must be approved by the VSMP authority. 
c.  A pollution prevention plan that identifies potential sources of pollutants that may reasonably be expected to affect the quality of stormwater discharges from the construction site and describe control measures that will be used to minimize pollutants in stormwater discharges from the construction site must be developed before land disturbance commences. 
(2)  In addition to the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section, if a specific waste load allocation for a pollutant has been established in a TMDL and is assigned to stormwater discharges from a construction activity, additional control measures must be identified and implemented by the operator so that discharges are consistent with the assumptions and requirements of the waste load allocation in a state water control board-approved TMDL. 
(3)  The SWPPP must address the following requirements, to the extent otherwise required by state law or regulations and any applicable requirements of a state permit: 
a.  Control stormwater volume and velocity within the site to minimize soil erosion; 
b.  Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flow rates and total stormwater volume, to minimize erosion at outlets and to minimize downstream channel and stream bank erosion; 
c.  Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction activities; 
d.  Minimize the disturbance of steep slopes; 
e.  Minimize the sediment discharges from the site. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls must address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site. 
f.  Provide and maintain natural buffers around surface waters, direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment removal and maximize stormwater infiltration, unless in feasible; 
g.  Minimize soil compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil; 
h.  Stabilization of disturbed areas must, at a minimum, be initiated immediately whenever any clearing, grading, excavating, or other earth disturbing activities have permanently ceased on any portion of the site, or temporarily ceased on any portion of the site and will not resume for a period exceeding 14 calendar days. Stabilization must be completed within a period of time determined by the VSMP authority. In arid, semiarid, and drought-stricken areas where initiating vegetative stabilization measures immediately is infeasible, alternative stabilization measures must be employed as specified by the VSMP authority; and 
i.  Utilize outlet structures that withdraw water from the surface, unless infeasible, when discharging from basins and impoundments. 
(b)  The SWPP shall be amended by the operator whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance that has a significant effect on the discharge of pollutants to state waters which is not addressed by the existing SWPPP. 
(c)  The SWPPP must be maintained by the operator at a central location onsite. If an onsite location is unavailable, notice of the SWPPP's location must be posted near the main entrance at the construction site. Operators shall make the SWPPP available for public review in accordance with Section II of the general permit, either electronically or in hard copy.

Such plans shall be stamped by a professional engineer or land surveyor licensed by the commonwealth. Site development plans for parking lots shall contain elevations based upon city data as furnished by the city engineer. Unless the city engineer shall determine that some deviation is necessary to prevent a demonstrable hardship upon the property owner or is in the best interest of the public safety, the site plan shall also demonstrate compliance with the construction requirements of this article. 
(Code 1988, § 32-270; Ord. No. 1991-24, § 1, 3-26-1991)  
Sec. 32-271. - Parking lot construction requirements generally. 
All parking lots shall be constructed in accordance with the following requirements for on-site and off-site improvements: 
(1)  On-site improvements. On-site improvements shall consist of either: 
a.  Parkway curbs or curbs and gutters around the entire interior perimeter of the parking lot; or 
b.  Wheel stops located at the end of each designated parking space in the parking lot, as determined by the city engineer in his sole discretion. 
(2)  Off-site improvements. Off-site improvements to the right-of-way adjacent to the property being improved shall consist of seven-inch thick concrete aprons from the property line to the curb or edge of street pavement, not to exceed 15 feet in length measured from the edge of the curb or street pavement. The developer of the parking lot shall install curbs and gutters, with necessary street widening and sidewalks along the entire street frontage of the property being improved to the adjoining property lines. The developer shall also install drainage pipes in all ditches along the street frontage of the property. The off-site drainage requirements of section 33-33 of this Code shall apply to these improvements. 
The city engineer may modify or waive the required installation for street curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks if he determines that the public safety will not be adversely affected by such waiver. A modification or waiver may only be issued if the subject property is located in an industrial M-1, industrial M-1-R, or industrial M-2 zoning district; if the street to be improved is not located within or immediately adjacent to a residentially-zoned area; or if the street serves primarily as an alley or service road and does not front on a commercial or residential area. Regardless of any modification or waiver of the curbing and guttering or sidewalk requirements, the city engineer may still require the widening of the roadway in accordance with city specifications. 
(3)  Existing parking lots. For the expansion of existing parking lots, the city engineer may grant an exception from the construction requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section if he deems that such an exception is necessary to prevent a demonstrable hardship upon the property owner based on the relative size of the expansion, and that the public health or safety will not be adversely affected by the exception. 
(4)  Construction methods and materials. Bituminous concrete or Portland cement concrete shall be utilized for all street improvements and widening and shall be designed and installed subject to the approval of the city engineer according to the street classification and use. All parking facilities shall be paved with bituminous concrete or Portland cement concrete. Parking lot wheel stops shall be constructed of concrete or of an equal material as approved by the city engineer. 
The city engineer may require paving surfaces and/or construction techniques which minimize surface stormwater runoff in areas where it is deemed necessary. The developer may select precast interlocking blocks, porous-type asphalt paving, detention basins or other methods approved by the city engineer. 
In M-1 and M-2 industrial zones, the city engineer may modify or waive the required installation of paving on storage areas away from street frontage so long as same do not result in dust, dirt, sand, gravel and similar materials being deposited or tracked on public streets or rights-of-way. Storage areas are defined as an area used for storage of materials and equipment not on a trailer, and non-temporary (greater than 30 days) storage of motor vehicles and trailers. Access aisles of storage areas shall be paved to the standards of a parking lot, and shall be no less than 24 feet wide. 
(5)  Phased improvements.

(a)  All parking lots shall be designed, constructed and maintained in such a manner that dust, dirt, sand, gravel and similar materials will not be deposited on public streets or rights-of-way. The owner or occupant of any land within the city in which a parking lot exists shall be responsible for cleanup operations. 
(b)  The depositing and tracking of dust, dirt, sand, gravel and similar materials from a parking lot shall be unlawful and shall also constitute a nuisance. Whenever it is determined by the city that such a nuisance exists, the owner or occupant of the site shall be given notice in writing of the existence of the nuisance, and if the nuisance is not abated within 15 days of receipt of the written notice, the city may cause the nuisance to be abated and bill the owner or occupant thereof for all costs incurred thereby. In addition, the city engineer may require that unimproved or graveled lots be promptly sealed with bituminous concrete, Portland cement concrete or bituminous surface treatment (double prime and seal) or be modified at the expense of the owner or occupant as may be necessary to assure elimination of the nuisance. The same requirement may also be imposed on parking lots with paved surfaces which have become neglected or not maintained thus causing the nuisance.

Sec. 32-273. - Parking lots; internal drainage requirements. 
(a)  Internal drainage shall be required for parking lots where the city engineer considers sufficient room to exist for ten or more parked cars in standard configuration and where, in the opinion of the city engineer, the combination of rooftop area and parking lot area will cause sufficient stormwater runoff to warrant the requirement. Internal drainage requirements shall be calculated based upon all stormwater runoff within the property to be developed and shall include rooftops and parking areas. Only the concrete apron between the property line and the curb shall be allowed to drain to the street. Catchbasins, as may be required, for the internal drainage shall be provided in all parking areas outside of the street right-of-way, and storm drainage pipes shall extend to the nearest drainage facility of sufficient capacity. The above requirements shall be mandatory except: 
(1)  Where underground drainage pipe culverts are not available within 150 feet of the parking lot, and when the developer receives the concurrence of the city engineer, with the certified statement and calculations of the developer's registered professional engineer or a licensed (3B) land surveyor, that no hazard or danger would result from the restricted release of stormwaters into the city street or right-of-way while: 
a.  Using, in the calculations, a stormwater runoff coefficient for a parking lot paved in its entirety with nonporous bituminous concrete; and 
b.  Detaining all stormwaters up to a minimum storm of ten-year frequency with a controlled release into the city right-of-way of only those quantities that would result from a storm of a two-year frequency with the site in its undeveloped state. 
Criteria for finding that a hazardous condition exists may include, but are not limited to, the exceeding of an eight-foot spread of stormwater in a curbed street for a two-year storm frequency at the nearest downstream inlet. 
(2)  Where alterations are proposed to a building with an existing parking lot with inadequate internal drainage, the facility may continue to be used without installation of internal drainage if: 
a.  The city engineer concurs with the certified statement and calculations of the developer's registered professional engineer or licensed (3B) land surveyor that no hazard or danger would result from continuing the present method, rate and quantity of stormwater discharge and if paved in its entirety with nonporous bituminous concrete pavement; and 
b.  If no addition to the parking area and roof area is performed. 
(b)  Where the city engineer considers a danger or hazard to exist, the developer shall, prior to building occupancy, eliminate or minimize his site's contribution to the problem to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Where an addition to the parking lot or roof top area will result in additional stormwater runoff, drainage and/or site modifications shall be performed by the developer as approved by the city engineer. 
(Code 1988, § 32-273; Ord. No. 1991-24, § 1, 3-26-1991)  
Sec. 32-274. - Waiver, modification of requirements. 
The city engineer may waive or modify any of the requirements of sections 32-271 through 32-273 in order to ensure site compliance with the provisions of chapter 9.1 (Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District Ordinance) of this Code.

The agent may require such additional information as he may deem necessary to process the request for the exception. 
(2)  The agent shall provide written notification of the exception request to all adjacent property owners. The notification shall adhere to the following requirements: 
(a)  Such notice shall specifically describe the exception requested and the date, time and location of the planning commission meeting first considering such request; and 
(b)  Such notice shall be mailed by the agent at least ten days before the planning commission meeting; and 
(c)  Evidence that such notice was sent by first class mail to the last known address as shown on the current real estate tax assessment book shall be deemed adequate compliance. 
(3)  The burden shall be on the subdivider to demonstrate the need for an exception. 
(4)  The commission shall not approve any exception unless it first receives a recommendation from the director of planning and unless it finds that: 
(a)  The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to public safety, health, or welfare, and will not adversely affect the property of others; 
(b)  The facts upon which the request is based are unique to the property and are not applicable generally to other property so as not to make reasonably practicable the formulation of general regulations to be adopted as an amendment to this chapter; 
(c)  No objection to the exception has been received in writing from the transportation department, city engineer, health department, or fire chief; and, either 
(d)  Strict adherence to the ordinance requirement will cause substantial injustice or hardship. The hardship or injustice is created by the unusual character of the property, including dimensions and topography, or by other extraordinary situation or condition of such property. Personal, financial, or self-inflicted hardship or injustice shall not be considered proper justification for an exception; or 
(e)  The exception will permit development to follow standards consistent with those commonly referred to as Traditional Neighborhood Development or New Urbanism. 
(5)  The commission in authorizing an exception may impose such reasonable conditions in addition to the regulations of this chapter as it may deem necessary in the public interest. The commission may require a guarantee or bond to ensure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. 
(6)  If granted, such exception shall be specifically stated in writing together with the supporting justifications and filed with the subdivision plan or such plat or plans deemed necessary by the agent. A note shall be prominently placed on the record plat detailing any exception so granted.

(b)  The entire development has been planned and designed as a comprehensive coordinated unit under a single master plan which has been approved via the site plan process. 
In these instances, the planning commission may grant, at their discretion, a waiver from minimum lot area, minimum lot width, side yard requirements, and lot frontage requirements upon finding that: 
(1)  The overall complex or structure, if considered as a single unit, meets all of the requirements of the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance; and 
(2)  Adequate parking is provided as per the requirements of chapter 40.1 and, where determined necessary by the planning commission, adequate easements or other agreements are recorded to guarantee access and maintenance of the parking areas and other common areas; and 
(3)  Where determined necessary by the planning commission, adequate easements, or agreements are recorded to allow grouping of signs on one standard, placement of signs in common areas or other appropriate arrangements made necessary because of the reduced yard area of the individual units; and 
(4)  The complex or structure is adequately designed and serviced from the standpoint of safety, and that the fire chief certifies that the fire safety equipment to be installed is adequately designed and the building official certifies the complex is designed to conform to the applicable building code, so as to offer adequate protection to life and property; and 
(5)  In accordance with Section 108.1 of the Building Code, application has been made to the building official to evaluate whether or not movement of a lot line increases the hazard to or decreases the level of safety of an existing building or structure in comparison to the building code under which such building or structure was constructed; and that following review and approval of said application, the building official recommends approval of the subdivision and any and all improvements required therein shall be required as a condition of final subdivision plat approval; and 
(6)  The request is not otherwise contrary to the city's Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and/or Subdivision Ordinance.

Sec. 33.1-25. - Master plan. 
For multi-phased subdivisions, the subdivider shall submit to the agent a master plan for all phases of the proposed subdivision as part of the preliminary plan submittal. The purpose of such a master plan is to permit the agent to advise the subdivider whether his plans are generally in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The director, upon submission of any master plan, may study it and advise the subdivider where it appears that changes are appropriate. The agent may mark the master plan indicating appropriate changes. The subdivider shall return such master plan to the agent with each preliminary plan. The master plan shall, at a minimum, show the name, location and dimensions of all streets entering the property, adjacent to the property or terminating at the boundary of the property to be subdivided. 
It shall also show the location of all proposed streets, their category (e.g., arterial, collector, etc.) and any future extensions, lots, development phases, parks, playgrounds and other proposed uses of the land to be subdivided and their approximate dimensions and a conceptual layout of the water and sewer systems. The master plan is not binding on the subdivider or the governing body. 
Review of a master plan does not constitute final subdivision approval or preliminary plan approval. For multi-phased subdivisions reviewed under this section, review of a master plan does not, in any way, guarantee approval of future subdivision phases. 
( Ord. No. 2010-06, § 2, 1-26-2010)  
Sec. 33.1-26. - Classification of subdivisions. 
(a)  Minor subdivision. A minor subdivision shall be a division of a tract of land into fewer than ten lots abutting an existing public road within the city system of primary or secondary highways and which does not create a new street or extend an existing street. Pursuant to section 33.1-12, any plat that modifies, vacates, or adjusts property lines shall be considered a minor subdivision. 
Any contiguous or internal property owned by the same subdivider, or deemed by the agent as a logical part of a contiguous or internal subdivision, cannot be subdivided into greater than ten lots without being reviewed as, and meeting the requirements of, a major subdivision. 
(b)  Major subdivision. A major subdivision shall be a division of a tract of land into ten or more lots or any division which creates a new street or extends any existing street. However, where additional lots are being created for the sole purpose of permanent open space or common areas, the subdivision may be reviewed as, and meet the requirements of, a minor subdivision. 
(c)  Townhouse or condominium subdivision. A townhouse or condominium subdivision shall be a division of a tract of land into lots for townhouses or condominiums as shown on an approved site plan pursuant to the zoning ordinance. A preliminary or final plan shall include only those requirements for design and minimum improvements required by article III of this chapter deemed necessary by the agent. 
(d)  Commercial subdivision. A subdivision of land on commercial zoned property where additional lots are being created for the purpose of additional infill outparcels, especially in the instance of creating a buildable lot where excess surface parking lots are currently in existence, or for the purpose of creating lot lines for mortgage or refinancing purposes or where anchor tenants must be subdivided off from attached, in-line space. A preliminary or final plan shall be approved upon the granting of an exception by the planning commission as required by subsection 33.1-23(B) of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2010-06, § 2, 1-26-2010; Ord. No. 2012-52, § 1, 9-25-2012)

(a)  The subdivider shall submit to the agent 12 copies of the preliminary subdivision plan for a minor subdivision and pay the appropriate subdivision plan review fee. 
(b)  Upon meeting all submittal requirements, the plan shall be reviewed by the agent and other agencies of the city and state as deemed necessary by the agent. The agent shall within 60 days approve or deny the subdivision plan and notify the subdivider of the action in writing. If a final plan is approved, such approval shall be in accordance with section 33.1-34. The agent shall certify such approval by signing the record plat. If a preliminary plan is approved, the agent shall include in the notification of preliminary approval all conditions required for final approval. If disapproved, the agent shall state in the notification to the subdivider the specific reasons for denial. The reasons for denial shall identify deficiencies in the plan which cause the disapproval by reference to specific duly adopted ordinances, regulations or policies, and shall generally identify such modifications or corrections as will permit approval of the plan. 
(c)  If the streets, drainage or utilities for the proposed minor subdivision are not fully improved as required by this chapter, the planning director shall require as conditions of the minor subdivision approval that: 
(1)  Curb, gutter, paving, sidewalks, drainage and utilities be improved to the standards for improvements currently applicable to a subdivision that is not a minor subdivision. These improvements shall be provided as required by sections 33.1-49 and 33.1-50. 
(2)  The city engineer also approves the proposed plat by affixing his signature thereto. Such signature shall not be affixed until the improvements required by sections 33.1-49 and 33.1-50 are installed or a bond or other security is posted and an agreement executed and filed with the city engineer in accordance with section 33.1-49. 
(3)  A parcel of land containing an existing residential structure may be subdivided so as to create one additional residential lot which shall be exempt from the requirements of sections 33.1-49 and 33.1-50, pertaining to installation of curbs and gutters, street and pavement widening and offsite drainage requirements, upon the following conditions: 
(i)  All provisions of the zoning ordinance of the city are met; and 
(ii)  Each parcel so subdivided must front on an existing, improved public street and the proposed subdivision of such parcel shall not require the extension of an existing public street or the construction of a new public street.

(2)  No part of the flag lot's access to the street (the "flagpole" or "panhandle") shall be less than 16 feet in width for residentially zoned lots and 50 feet in width for non-residentially zoned lots. 
(3)  The front property line of a flag lot shall not abut the side yard of an adjacent lot. 
(4)  The strip of land used for access to the main portion of the flag lot (the "flagpole" or "panhandle") shall not be included in calculating the area of the lot for the purpose of determining compliance with the dimensional requirements of this chapter or chapter 40.1 of this Code, nor shall any part of the "flagpole" or "panhandle" be considered to be the front yard. 
(5)  No more than ten percent of the lots, in subdivisions which create ten or more lots, may be flag lots. 
(k)  Lot size. The minimum lot size shall be in accordance with the zoning ordinance provided, however that whenever there shall be plans in existence, approved by either the transportation department or by the governing body, for the widening, extension, or construction of any street or highway, the commission may require additional setbacks and yards for any new construction or for any structures altered or remodeled adjacent to the future planned right-of-way in order to preserve and protect the planned future right-of-way for such proposed street or highway. 
(l)  Lot arrangements, design and shape. The lot arrangement, design and shape shall be related to the topography such that each lot has: 
(1)  An acceptable building site in compliance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance;

(a)  In subdivisions, or parts of subdivisions, improvements shall be provided by the subdivider as follows: 
(1)  Streets shall be graded to the full width and shall be designed in accordance to the approved cross-sections and profiles and the Traditional Neighborhood Design provisions contained within the Virginia Department of Transportation's Subdivision Street Design Guide, as last amended, and the City of Portsmouth Master Transportation Plan. 
(2)  The pavement base and surface of streets shall be appropriate to the type of development and type of use contemplated and shall be installed in accordance with standards and specifications of the city. The thickness of base and pavement shall be determined by actual soil bearing tests of the California Bearing Ratio type or its equivalent (performed at the expense of the subdivider by an approved testing laboratory at locations specified by the city engineer) and by anticipated traffic loading methods developed by the Asphalt Institute or the Portland Cement Association. 
(3)  A drainage system shall be provided to ensure adequate drainage of both natural and stormwater. The system shall be constructed and installed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city engineer. The subdivider shall be required to install necessary drainage facilities outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by the subdivider but necessitated, at least in part, by the construction or improvement of the subdivision. 
(4)  Curbs and gutters shall be installed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the city engineer and shall be designed in accordance with the Traditional Neighborhood Design provisions contained within the Virginia Department of Transportation's Subdivision Street Design Guide, as last amended, and the City of Portsmouth Master Transportation Plan. The use of valley gutters shall be avoided. 
(5)  Water lines shall be installed by the subdivider in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the director of public utilities. The subdivider shall be required to install necessary water facilities outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by the subdivider but necessitated, at least in part, by the construction or improvement of the subdivision. 
(6)  Sanitary sewerage shall be installed by the subdivider in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the director of public utilities. The subdivider shall be required to install necessary sanitary sewage facilities outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by the subdivider but necessitated, at least in part, by the construction or improvement of the subdivision. 
(7)  Sidewalks, at least five feet in width, shall be installed on both sides of all arterial and collector streets. Sidewalks, at least five feet in width, shall be installed along all street frontage planned for apartments or townhouses. Sidewalks, at least five feet in width, shall be required along one side of all minor and cul-de-sac streets; however, the planning commission may reduce or eliminate the requirements on any minor street, as defined in section 33.1-2 of the City Code, or cul-de-sac. The commission must find that such reduction will not create a pedestrian safety hazard. Sidewalks shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications of the city and must include ramps for wheelchair access at all intersections in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and in accordance with any revisions approved by the Federal Highway Administration. 
(8)  Standard city street signs shall be installed at all street intersections. 
(9)  Necessary traffic-control devices, including, but not limited to, traffic signals or traffic signs which are required within the subdivision or adjacent thereto and which are approved by the traffic engineer, shall be installed.

When requested by the city engineer, the developer shall provide calculations for major culverts and bridge crossings which shall be based on a 25-year frequency to ensure that no flood hazard will result to the public rights-of-way or to residences or other structures. 
(13)  For the purpose of creating residential lots on existing streets, the planning director may modify or waive the street grading, pavement base, surface and curb and gutter requirements on an existing street constructed without such required improvements if: 
a.  The city has no plans to install such improvements on the street within the next ten years; 
b.  The street is currently improved or will be improved to a standard equivalent to similar streets in the neighborhood; 
c.  After consultation with the city engineer, a determination is made that the street will provide adequate and safe access and drainage to existing and future residents in accordance with the purposes of the subdivision ordinance; and 
d.  The real property for which the waiver or modification is sought contains no more than five new, adjacent lots. 
Any such waiver or modification shall not apply to required drainage improvements except for curbs and gutters.

(c)  The developer shall be required to furnish all other data pertaining to bridges and culverts which shall be deemed necessary by the city engineer. 
(d)  The cost of all physical improvements required by the provisions of this section shall be paid by the subdivider. If the actual installation of improvements is not completed prior to the application made for final plat approval, the subdivider shall execute and file with the city engineer an agreement and bond in an amount equal to the estimated costs (as established by the city) of such improvements, plus ten percent, guaranteeing that the required improvements will be properly and satisfactorily installed within a reasonable length of time, but, in no event, more than two years. An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank in a form approved by the city attorney or a deposit of funds in escrow may be accepted in lieu of bond under the same terms and conditions applicable to bonds. The bond, letter of credit or deposit may be released by the city when specific improvements covered by the bond have been completed and approved by the city engineer as being in accordance with city standards and specifications. 
(e)  Upon written request by the subdivider to the city engineer, periodic partial releases of the bond, letter of credit, escrow or other performance guarantee may be made in an accumulative amount equal to no less than 80 percent of the original amount of such bond, letter of credit, escrow or other performance guarantee. Periodic partial releases shall be based upon the percentage of facilities completed and accepted by the city engineer. Periodic partial releases may not occur before the completion of at least 30 percent of the facilities. The city engineer shall not be required to approve more than three periodic partial releases in any 12-month period. Within 30 days after receipt of a written notice from the subdivider for a periodic partial release or a final complete release of any bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee, the city engineer shall notify the subdivider of approval or nonapproval of such requests or of any specific defects or deficiencies in construction and suggested corrective measures. If no such notice is provided to the subdivider within the two-year period, the periodic partial release shall be deemed approved. No final release shall be granted until after expiration of said two-year period and there is an additional request in writing sent by certified mail, return receipt, to the city manager. If no action is taken within ten days from the receipt of this request, then the final release of the bond, letter of credit, escrow or other performance guarantee shall be deemed approved. 
(f)  Upon acceptance of improvements, the subdivider shall execute and file with the city engineer a maintenance bond equal to ten percent of the total cost of the public improvements installed for the subdivision. The subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance or repairs for the public improvements as required by the city engineer for a period of one year after acceptance of such improvements. 
(g)  In those instances in which any of the improvements as required by this section could be more conveniently installed by the city or its agent, the city may, in its discretion, accept payment of the total cost of such improvements in lieu of actual construction or bond as required above. Such payment will be set forth in an agreement approved by the city attorney, which agreement will set forth the conditions of payment and a time limit upon the use of such payment by the city, such time limit in no instance to exceed ten years. If such payment is not utilized by the city within the agreed time limit, it will revert to the subdivider. 
(h)  If a subdivider makes an advance of payments for or construction of reasonable and necessary road improvements located outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by the subdivider, the need for which is substantially generated and reasonably required by the construction or improvement of the subdivision or development, and such advance is accepted, the city may agree to reimburse the subdivider from such funds as the city may make available for such purpose from time to time for the cost of such advance together with interest, which shall be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, at a rate equal to the rate of interest on bonds most recently issued by the city on the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  The city shall determine or confirm that the road improvements were substantially generated and reasonably required by the construction or improvement of the subdivision or development, and shall determine or confirm the cost thereof on the basis of a study conducted by qualified traffic engineers and approved and accepted by the subdivider. 
(2)  The city shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a report, accepted and approved by the subdivider indicating the governmental services required to be furnished to the subdivision or development and an estimate of the annual cost thereof for the period during which the reimbursement is to be made to the subdivider. 
(3)  The city may make annual reimbursements to the subdivider from funds made available for such purpose from time to time, including, but not limited to, real estate taxes assessed and collected against the land and improvements on the property included in the subdivision in amounts equal to the amount by which such real estate taxes exceed the annual cost of providing reasonable and necessary governmental services to such subdivision or development. 
(i)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the occupancy of any structure or building to be located in such subdivision unless and until the improvements required herein which are directly necessary to the use and enjoyment of such structure have been installed and accepted by the city, except that final roadway surface need not be applied prior to issuance of such certificate if a suitable base and interim sealing agent acceptable to the city have been laid. 
(j)  A subdivider or developer of land shall pay to the city the pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary sewerage, water and drainage facilities located outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by the subdivider or developer but necessitated or required, at least in part, by the construction or improvement of the subdivision or development, subject to the following: 
(1)  No such payment shall be required until such time as the city shall establish a general sewer, water and drainage improvement program for an area having related and common sewer, water and drainage conditions and within which the land owned or controlled by the subdivider or developer is located. 
(2)  Such share shall be limited to the proportion of such total estimated cost which the increased sewage flow, water flow and/or increased volume and velocity of stormwater runoff to be actually caused by the subdivision or development bears to total estimated volume and velocity of such sewage, water and/or runoff from the applicable area having an established general improvement plan as required by subsection (j)(1) of this section. 
(3)  In lieu of any such payment, the subdivider or developer shall execute and file with the city engineer an agreement and bond with surety, satisfactory to the city attorney, equal to the estimated costs, as established by the city engineer, of such improvements conditioned upon payment at the commencement of construction of the facilities. An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank in a form approved by the city attorney may also be accepted under the same terms and conditions applicable to bonds. 
(4)  Any payments received shall be kept in a separate account for each of the individually established improvement programs until such time as they are expended for the improvement program. 
( Ord. No. 2010-06, § 2, 1-26-2010)  
Sec. 33.1-50. - Off-site drainage. 
(a)  New development. 
(1)  A building permit will be issued by the building official for proposed construction of new development only after the city engineer has determined that the additional off-site drainage flow from such proposed construction will not be a danger or hazard to an existing off-site drainage facility or property in the proposed construction sites' drainage basin. (Off-site drainage facilities are those facilities outside the property limits of the proposed construction site necessary to carry drainage flow from construction site to a drainage basin.) New open ditches or modification of existing ditches will not be permitted in areas zoned residential unless included in the city's master drainage plan. 
(2)  The city engineer will determine whether a hazard or danger exists from such additional off-site drainage flow by approved drainage computations furnished to the city engineer by the permit applicant in accordance with the city's master drainage plan, existing field conditions and zoning required by city council. Computations shall be based on a normal storm return period of ten years using U.S. Department of Commerce curves and utilizing applicable existing master drainage plans on file in the office of the city engineer, or as adjusted by the city. Where reasonably necessary to protect public or private property, the city engineer may require calculation of drainage flow and installation of improvements based on a normal storm return period of greater than five years. 
(3)  After the city engineer determines no hazard or danger results from additional offsite drainage flow, the building official will issue a building permit if other requirements are met. 
(4)  When the city engineer determines that a hazard or danger results from additional off-site drainage flow, and all other legal mandates are met, the building permit will be issued only after: 
a.  A plan is submitted by the permit applicant to provide the off-site drainage and is approved by the city engineer, and the permit applicant agrees to construct such approved off-site drainage pursuant to the bonding or other financing procedures set out in section 33.1-49 of this Code. 
b.  The city council, at its discretion, independently or in conjunction with the permit applicant, may agree to construct such approved drainage facilities; provided, that in areas zoned residential the city will construct such facilities using nonlocal funds only. (Nonlocal funds are those received by the city from federal or state grants.) 
(b)  Existing systems. All developments shall provide retention and mass detention facilities to reduce the additional drainage flow to all existing drainage systems where sufficient land exists to permit these facilities and/or where needed to permit proper utilization of existing and proposed drainage facilities. 
(c)  Safe and functional design. Approval by the city engineer will not release the liability of the developer from the requirements of a safe and functional design. 
(d)  Compliance with state law. The city shall comply with the express terms and conditions of Code of Virginia, §§ 15.2-2241 through 15.2-2276. 
( Ord. No. 2010-06, § 2, 1-26-2010)  
Sec. 33.1-51. - Minor subdivision standards.

(1)  The subdivision meets the definition of "minor subdivision" set forth in article II of this chapter and existing facilities will adequately accommodate the modification; 
(2)  The proposal meets all requirements with respect to lot sizes and area of the zoning ordinance and of this chapter, and that the proposal will not create a violation of any of the provisions of the zoning ordinance; 
(3)  The proposal will not adversely affect the development of the remainder of the parcel or of any other adjoining property; and 
(4)  In the case of an in-fill subdivision, the provisions of section 33.1-26 are met. 
(b)  If the planning director finds that the proposed subdivision or resubdivision meets all the requirements as set forth above and elsewhere in this chapter, he shall certify the proposed plat as a "minor subdivision" and, by affixing a notation to that effect and his signature thereto, grant final subdivision approval. 
(c)  If the streets, drainage or utilities for the proposed minor subdivision are not fully improved as required by this chapter, the planning director shall require as conditions of the minor subdivision approval that: 
(1)  Curb, gutter, paving, sidewalks, drainage and utilities be improved to the standards for improvements currently applicable to a subdivision that is not a minor subdivision. These improvements shall be provided as required by sections 33.1-49 and 33.1-50. 
(2)  The city engineer also approves the proposed plat by affixing his signature thereto. Such signature shall not be affixed until the improvements required by sections 33.1-49 and 33.1-50 are installed or a bond or other security is posted and an agreement executed and filed with the city engineer in accordance with section 33.1-49. 
(d)  For the purpose of creating residential lots on existing streets, the planning director may modify or waive the street grading, pavement base, surface and curb and gutter requirements on an existing street constructed without such required improvements if: 
a.  The city has no plans to install such improvements on the street within the next ten years; 
b.  The street is currently improved or will be improved to a standard equivalent to similar streets in the neighborhood; 
c.  After consultation with the city engineer, a determination is made that the street will provide adequate and safe access and drainage to existing and future residents in accordance with the purposes of the subdivision ordinance; and 
d.  The real property for which the waiver or modification is sought contains no more than five new, adjacent lots. 
Any such waiver or modification shall not apply to required drainage improvements except for curbs and gutters.

A taxpayer offering to pay taxes on the parcel of real estate shall be directed by the city treasurer to pay first all delinquent taxes and then such current taxes as are due or past due. Where a taxpayer submits monies designated for payment of current taxes on a specific parcel of land which is subject to delinquent taxes, the treasurer shall, notwithstanding the taxpayer's instructions to the contrary, cause the payment to be applied to the first or oldest delinquent taxes. This application of funds shall be made in all cases, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, regardless of whether the taxpayer tendered the payment with or without the knowledge of the provisions of this section.

Sec. 35-9. - Tax relief for qualifying motor vehicles. 
(a)  Basis of tax relief. The tax relief provided under this section relates to the Personal Property Tax Relief Act of 1998, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3523 et seq. ("PPTRA"), which was modified by the enactment of Chapter 1 of the Acts of Assembly, 2004 Special Session I, and the provisions of Item 503 of Chapter 951 of the 2005 Acts of Assembly (the 2005 revisions to the 2004-06 Appropriations Act, hereinafter cited as the "2005 Appropriations Act"). Terms used in this section that have defined meanings set forth in PPTRA shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3523. 
(b)  Method of computing and reflecting tax relief. For tax years commencing in 2006, the provisions of Item 503.E of the 2005 Appropriations Act, providing for the computation of tax relief as a specific dollar amount to be offset against the total taxes that would otherwise be due but for PPTRA and the reporting of such specific dollar relief on the tax bill, shall apply. The city council, shall, by resolution or ordinance, set the percentage of tax relief at a level that is anticipated to exhaust PPTRA relief funds provided to the city by the commonwealth. Personal property tax bills shall set forth on their face the specific dollar amount of relief credited with respect to each qualifying vehicle. 
(c)  Allocation of relief among taxpayers. Relief with respect to qualifying vehicles shall be provided at a percentage, annually fixed and applied to the first $20,000.00 in value of each such qualifying vehicle that is estimated to exhaust all available PPTRA relief from the Commonwealth. 
(d)  Transitional provisions. Pursuant to authority conferred in Item 503.D of the 2005 Appropriations Act, the city treasurer shall collect personal property taxes, in the amount of 100 percent of tax due without regard to any formal entitlement to state PPTRA relief, plus applicable penalties and interest, to any taxpayer whose taxes with respect to a qualifying vehicle for tax year 2005 or any prior tax year remain unpaid on September 1, 2006, or such date as commonwealth funds for reimbursement of the commonwealth's share of such bill have become unavailable, whichever occurs first. 
(e)  Penalty and interest. Penalty and interest with respect to bills issued pursuant to this section shall be computed on the entire amount of tax owed. Penalties and interest shall be computed at the rate provided in sections 35-4(c) and 35-5(b) from the original due date of the tax. 
(Code 1988, § 35-7.1; Ord. No. 2005-115, § 1, 12-13-2005; Ord. No. 2006-42, § 1, 5-23-2006)  
Sec. 35-9.1. - Exemption from personal property taxation for one motor vehicle owned and regularly used by an eligible disabled veteran. 
(a)  For the calendar year beginning January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for each and every calendar year thereafter, unless changed, not more than one motor vehicle owned and regularly used for personal use by an eligible disabled veteran shall be exempted from the personal property tax levied by the City of Portsmouth on motor vehicles. 
(b)  When used in this section, the phrase "disabled veteran" shall mean any veteran who has either lost, or lost the use of, one or both legs, or an arm or a hand, or who is blind, or who is permanently and totally disabled, and who therefore meets the requirements established in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3506(19), including that the disability is service connected, as certified by the department of veterans services. For purposes of this section, a veteran is blind if he or she meets the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 46.2-100. 
(c)  To qualify for the exemption established herein, a disabled veteran must submit to the commissioner of the revenue: 
(1)  A written statement from the department of veterans services confirming that he or she meets the requirements of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3506(19); and 
(2)  A written statement from the department of veteran services confirming that the disability is service connected; and 
(3)  An application in the form required by the commissioner of the revenue and specifically identifying the motor vehicle for which an exemption is sought. 
(d)  An eligible disabled veteran may have no more than one motor vehicle exempted from taxation pursuant to this section. All other motor vehicles owned or regularly used by said eligible disabled veteran shall be taxed or levied pursuant to the general tax rate established by city council on motor vehicles. 
(e)  If an eligible disabled veteran seeks to change the motor vehicle subject to the exemption, the veteran must first submit an application to the commissioner of the revenue identifying the new vehicle. The exemption established by this section shall not automatically transfer or retroactively apply to a new motor vehicle acquired by an eligible disabled veteran. If an eligible disabled veteran transfers the exemption from one motor vehicle to another but maintains ownership of the first motor vehicle, the exemption shall continue to apply to the original motor vehicle for the tax year of the transfer and shall not apply to the new vehicle until the next tax year. 
(f)  The exemption established by this section shall not continue with a motor vehicle upon transfer, sale or other disposition of the vehicle by an eligible disabled veteran. 
(g)  The exemption established by this section shall first take effect for the calendar year in which an eligible disabled veteran submits an application meeting the requirements of subsection (c) for a qualified motor vehicle. The exemption shall not be applied retroactively to previous years' tax filings.

Sec. 35-10. - Charging off and correction of delinquent personal property taxes. 
The commissioner of the revenue is hereby authorized to charge off or correct, from time to time, such unpaid and outstanding delinquent taxes for personal property as may be found to have been erroneously or incorrectly assessed. Prior to any such action, the commissioner of the revenue shall file with the city council, the chief financial officer and the city attorney a statement of the matter, and no such action shall become final until the expiration of ten days from the date that such statement shall have been received by the council in regular session. All such actions occurring in any one calendar month shall be consolidated into and filed as one report.

Sec. 35-11. - Proration of tax on motor vehicles, trailers and boats. 
(a)  There shall be a personal property tax assessed and levied at the rate established each year by the city council on motor vehicles, trailers and boats ("hereafter referred to in this section as taxable property") which are titled or acquire a situs within the city on or after January 2 of any year. When taxable property acquires a situs within the city on or after January 2, the personal property tax for that year shall be assessed to the owner prorated on a monthly basis for the portion of the tax year during which the taxable property is titled or has situs within the city. When taxable property with a situs in the city is transferred to a new owner within the city, the personal property tax shall be assessed to the new owner prorated on a monthly basis for the portion of the tax year during which the new owner owns the taxable property. For the purpose of proration, a period of more than one-half of a month shall be counted as a full month, and a period of less than one-half of a month shall not be counted. All taxable property which acquires situs or has its title transferred after January 1 shall be assessed as of the first day of the month in which the taxable property acquires situs within the city or has its title transferred. The owner of taxable property acquiring situs within the city or to whom taxable property is transferred or who shall transfer title or acquire a new tax situs for the taxable property shall file a declaration with the commissioner of the revenue within 30 days of the date on which such property acquires a change of situs or title is transferred, on a form provided by the commissioner. 
(b)  When any taxable property loses its situs within the city or its title is transferred to a new owner, the taxpayer shall from that time be relieved from personal property tax on such taxable property on a prorated basis. The taxpayer is entitled to receive a credit for taxes already paid towards taxable property newly transferred to the taxpayer, or a credit against any property taxes outstanding against the taxpayer on a prorated basis. If there be no tax liability against which the credit can apply, the commissioner of the revenue shall apply to the city treasurer for a refund which can be made without further city council action. No refunds will be paid while the owner of the taxable property has any delinquent tax account with, or liability to, the city. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any taxable property which acquires a situs within the commonwealth in a nonprorating locality. 
(c)  Taxes on all taxable property titled or with a situs within the city acquired on or before April 15 of any year shall be paid on or before June 5 of that year. Any person failing to pay the tax by the due date shown on the bill shall incur interest and penalties as set forth in sections 35-4 and 35-5. 
(d)  Taxes on all taxable property which acquires situs within the city or has its title transferred after April first and through December thirty-first of any year shall be paid by the date shown on the bill which is mailed to the owner of the taxable property; provided, however, such due date shall be not less than 30 days after the date of the issuance of the tax bill. Any person failing to pay the tax by the date shown on the bill shall incur interest and penalties as set forth in sections 35-3 and 35-4. 
(e)  Any person who fails to file with the commissioner of the revenue as required in subsection (a) of this section, but is subsequently assessed with personal property tax, shall be taxed from the date that the title or situs was acquired and incur penalty and interest as provided herein. 
(f)  An exemption from the tax provided for in this section shall be granted for any tax year or portion thereof during which the property was legally assessed by another jurisdiction in the commonwealth, and such tax on the assessed property was paid and not refunded in whole or in part. 
(g)  Any person who moves to the city from a nonprorating locality in a single tax year shall be entitled to a property tax credit from the city if the person was liable for personal property taxes on a motor vehicle and has paid those taxes to a nonprorating locality and the owner replaces for any reason the original vehicle upon which taxes are due to the nonprorating locality for the same tax year. The city shall provide a credit against the total tax due on the replacement vehicle in an amount equal to the tax paid to the nonprorating locality for the period of time commencing with the disposition of the original vehicle and continuing through the close of the tax year in which the owner incurred tax liability to the nonprorating locality for the original vehicle.

Sec. 35-14. - Relief from erroneous assessments and erroneous payments generally. 
(a)  Any person who feels that he has been erroneously assessed for real estate tax or local levies on tangible personal property, machinery and tools, or a local license fee, or any other local levy, may, within three years from the last day of, the tax year for which such assessment was made, or within one year from the date of the assessment, whichever is later, make in writing application to the commissioner of the revenue regarding the assessment of local levies on tangible personal property, machinery and tools, or a local license fee, or any other local levy, or to the city assessor regarding the assessment of real estate, seeking by such application exoneration or abatement of such tax if same is unpaid or refund if such tax has been paid. An application that is not timely made will not be considered. 
(b)  If the commissioner of revenue when the application is for relief from the assessment of local levies on tangible personal property, machinery and tools, or a local license fee or any other local levy, or if the city assessor when the application is for relief from the assessment of real estate, is satisfied that he has erroneously assessed any applicant for the assessment in question, and assessment exceeds the proper amount, the commissioner of revenue or city assessor shall certify to the city treasurer and the city manager, or his designee, the amount erroneously assessed. If the taxes or fees have not been paid, the applicant shall be exonerated from payment of so much thereof as is erroneous, and if such taxes or fees have been paid, the city treasurer or his successor in office and the city manager, or his designee, shall refund to the applicant the amount erroneously paid, together with any penalties and interest paid thereon. When the commissioner of revenue or city assessor who made the erroneous assessment has been succeeded by another person, such person shall have the same authority as the commissioner or assessor making the original erroneous assessment, provided he makes diligent investigation to determine that the original assessment was erroneously made and certifies thereto to the city treasurer, the city manager, or his designee, and the city attorney. Additionally, the same refund procedure shall apply to the refunds of erroneous overpayment of taxes or fees by any applicant. 
(c)  If the assessment is less than the proper amount, the commissioner of the revenue or the city assessor shall assess such applicant with the proper amount. 
(d)  When an unpaid erroneous assessment of real estate is corrected under this section, and such real estate has been sold at a delinquent land sale, the city assessor shall certify a copy of such correction to the clerk of the circuit court of the city and the clerk shall note the correction in the delinquent land book opposite the entry of the tract or lot for the year or years for which the correction is made. 
(e)  Where the assessment which is subsequently considered erroneous was made as a result of miscalculation or ministerial error on the part of the commissioner of revenue, the city assessor, or any officer or employee of the city, interest on the amount erroneously assessed will be paid along with the refund at a rate of ten percent per annum from the date that the tax was paid or from the date the tax was required to be paid, whichever date is later. No interest will be paid where the assessment in question was based on a good faith assessment, was made as a result of a statutory assessment, or where the error was made on the part of the applicant. 
(f)  Whenever the city treasurer determines that there is a valid and legal claim against the city due by reason of the erroneous payment of any local tax, levy, license or fee, he is hereby fully empowered, authorized and directed, with the concurrence and approval of the city manager, and with the consent of the city attorney, to forthwith pay the amount of such claim to the respective claimant from the general fund or such special fund into which such tax, levy, license or fee may have been deposited.

(3)  Determine further that real estate devoted to open-space use is: (i) within an agricultural, a forestal, or an agricultural and forestal district entered into pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 15.2-4300 et seq., or (ii) subject to a recorded perpetual easement that is held by a public body, and promotes the open-space use classification, as defined in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3230, or (iii) subject to a recorded commitment entered into by the landowners with the city council, or its authorized designee, not to change the use to a nonqualifying use for a time period stated in the commitment of not less than four years nor more than ten years.

Sec. 35-131. - Service charge on certain real property exempt from taxation, imposed. 
There is hereby imposed, pursuant to the authority of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3400 et seq., a fee or service charge which shall be collected from the owners of all real estate within the city which is exempt from taxation under Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3606(A)(1), which is property owned directly or indirectly by the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof. 
(Code 1973, § 35-231; Code 1988, § 35-131)  
Sec. 35-132. - Computation. 
(a)  The fee or service charge imposed in section 35-131 shall be based on the assessed value of the real estate and the amount which the city expended in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year such charge is assessed for the purpose of furnishing police and fire protection and for the collection and disposal of refuse. The cost of public school education shall be included in such amount in determining the service charge imposed or faculty and staff housing of an educational institution. Any amount received from federal or state grants specifically designated for such purposes and assistance provided to the city pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 14.1-84.1 et seq. shall not be considered in determining the cost of providing such services for the real estate. The expenditures for services not provided for certain real estate shall not be applicable to the calculations of the service charge for such real estate, nor shall such expenditures be applicable when a service is currently funded by another service charge. The service charge shall not be applicable to public roadways or property held for future construction of such roadways. This service charge shall not exceed the real estate tax which would have been payable had such property been fully taxable. The service charge shall be fixed by dividing such expenditures by the assessed fair market value of all the real estate within the city, except real estate owned by the United States government or any of its instrumentalities, expressed in $100.00, including nontaxable property, provided there first be listed and published by the city assessor in the land book of the city in the same manner as taxable real estate, all the exempt real estate. 
(b)  In the valuation of exempt real estate for purposes of this section, artistic and historical significance shall not be taken into account. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the assessment or the valuation of real estate for the purposes of this section may apply to the city assessor for correction thereof. If the city assessor advises that the assessment or valuation is erroneous, he shall correct the same. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city assessor may appeal to the circuit court of the city, as provided in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984.

(a)  Pursuant to the authority granted by § 58.1-3664 of the Code of Virginia, environmental restoration sites are hereby determined to be a separate class of property which is exempt from real estate taxation up to limit set herein, as set forth in this section. 
(b)  An environmental restoration site means real estate which contains or did contain environmental contamination from the release of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, solid waste or petroleum, the restoration of which would abate or prevent pollution to the atmosphere or waters of the Commonwealth of Virginia and which (i) is subject to voluntary remediation pursuant to § 10.1-1232 of the Code of Virginia and (ii) receives a certificate of continued eligibility from the Virginia Waste Management Board during each year for which it qualifies for the applicable tax exemption. 
(c)  An environmental restoration site shall be classified as such for a single five-year period. That period shall commence on the date that the department of environmental quality issues a certification of voluntary completion for the property. A classification issued at any time during a calendar year shall be effective for the entire calendar year, without pro rating. The classification shall be for the current year and subsequent years only, no property shall be eligible for the classification for any year prior to 2006, and requests for reclassification for years prior to 2006 are both unauthorized and prohibited. No property shall be eligible for more than one five-year classification period. 
(d)  If an environmental restoration site is located in an enterprise zone designated by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia to take effect as of but not prior to January 1, 2014, then the classification granted by this section shall be for the full assessed value of land and improvements for any qualified tax parcel, up to a maximum assessed value of $5,000,000.00. Any assessed value in excess of $5,000,000.00 for any qualified tax parcel shall be fully taxable. For all other environmental restoration sites, the classification granted by this section shall be for the full assessed value of land and improvements for any qualified tax parcel, up to a maximum assessed value of $3,000,000.00. Any assessed value in excess of $3,000,000.00 for any qualified tax parcel shall be fully taxable. 
(e)  The burden shall be on the property owner to provide to the city assessor, within 90 days of the property owner's receipt: (i) a certification of voluntary completion from the department of environmental quality showing that the property qualifies initially as an environmental restoration site; and (ii) a certificate of continued eligibility from the Virginia Waste Management Board for each subsequent year of the five-year tax exemption period for which an exemption is sought. The city assessor shall have no responsibility to issue or to maintain the classification authorized under this section unless the property owner timely provides full and proper documentation of eligibility during each applicable tax year. 
(f)  If the owner of any property classified hereunder as an environmental restoration site fails to timely pay to the City of Portsmouth any other taxes which are legally owed to the city, he shall be deemed to have waived his claim to have the property classified under this section. This waiver shall apply for the tax year in question and for all subsequent tax years for which the property otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Once the classification of a property is deemed waived under this section, the waiver shall attach to the property and shall be irrevocable, regardless of possible change of ownership of the property.

(a)  Pursuant to article X, section 6-B of the Constitution of Virginia, for tax years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, the city exempts from taxation the real property described in subsection (b) of the surviving spouse of any covered person who occupies the real property as his or her principal place of residence. If the covered person's death occurred on or prior to July 1, 2017, and the surviving spouse has a principal residence on July 1, 2017, eligible for the exemption under this section, then the exemption for the surviving spouse shall begin on July 1, 2017. If the covered person's death occurs after July 1, 2017, and the surviving spouse has a principal residence eligible for the exemption under this section on the date that such covered person dies, then the exemption for the surviving spouse shall begin on the date that such covered person dies. If the surviving spouse acquires the property after July 1, 2017, then the exemption shall begin on the date of acquisition. The city shall not be liable for any interest on any refund due to the surviving spouse for taxes paid prior to the surviving spouse's filing of the affidavit or written statement required by section 35-237. 
(b)  Those dwellings qualifying for an exemption hereunder with assessed values in the most recently ended tax year that are not in excess of the average assessed value for such year of single-family residential dwellings in the city shall qualify for a total exemption from real property taxes under this article. If the value of a qualifying dwelling is in excess of the average assessed value as described in this subsection, then only that portion of the assessed value in excess of the average assessed value shall be subject to real property taxes, and the portion of the assessed value that is not in excess of the average assessed value shall be exempt from real property taxes. Single-family homes, condominiums, town homes, manufactured homes as defined in Code of Virginia, § 46.2-100 whether or not the wheels and other equipment previously used for mobility have been removed, and other types of dwellings of surviving spouses, whether or not the land on which the single-family home, condominium, town home, manufactured home, or other type of dwelling of a surviving spouse is located is owned by someone other than the surviving spouse, that (i) meet this requirement and (ii) are occupied by such persons as their principal place of residence shall qualify for the real property tax exemption. If the land on which the single-family home, condominium, town home, manufactured home, or other type of dwelling is located is not owned by the surviving spouse, then the land is not exempt. 
(c)  The surviving spouse shall qualify for the exemption so long as the surviving spouse does not remarry and continues to occupy the real property as his or her principal place of residence. The exemption applies without any restriction on the spouse's moving to a different principal place of residence. 
(d)  The exemption from real property taxes shall apply to (i) the qualifying dwelling, or that portion of the value of such dwelling and land that qualifies for the exemption pursuant to subsection (b), and (ii) with the exception of land not owned by the surviving spouse, the land, not exceeding one acre, upon which it is situated. A real property improvement other than a dwelling, including the land upon which such improvement is situated, shall also be exempt from taxation so long as the principal use of the improvement is (a) to house or cover motor vehicles or household goods and personal effects as classified in subdivision A 14 of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3503 and as listed in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3504 and (b) for other than a business purpose.

Such real property does not include any interest held under a leasehold or term of years. 
(f)  In the event that (i) a surviving spouse is entitled to an exemption under this section by virtue of holding the property in any of the three ways set forth in subsection (e) and (ii) one or more other persons have an ownership interest in the property that permits them to occupy the property, then the tax exemption for the property that otherwise would have been provided shall be prorated by multiplying the amount of the exemption by a fraction the numerator of which is 1 and the denominator of which equals the total number of people having an ownership interest that permits them to occupy the property.

(a)  Exemptions by classification. The exemptions by classification set out in Code of Virginia, §§ 58.1-3606 and 58.1-360958.1-3622 are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference. The city assessor is authorized to administratively approve exemptions by classification for qualified real and personal property. All requests for exemption by classification shall be initiated by application of the property owner. The application shall be on forms provided by the city assessor and shall contain all information and documents necessary to evaluate whether the property qualifies for the exemption. The city assessor may waive the requirement of a formal application for property owned directly by the United States, the Commonwealth of Virginia, or any political subdivision thereof. The city assessor shall evaluate the application in strict conformance with applicable statutory criteria and shall provide a final written determination to the applicant, the city treasurer, and the commissioner of the revenue. 
(b)  Exemptions by designation. In the interest of sound fiscal policy, no requests for exemption by designation shall be accepted or considered by city council; nor shall any such request be granted administratively. The city assessor is authorized to recognize only those tax exemptions by designation granted by the general assembly up until January 1, 2003, which designations shall apply to existing and newly acquired property used for qualifying purposes. 
(c)  Strict construction. All requests for tax exemption shall be strictly construed, with any doubt resolved against the grant of exemption. 
(d)  Effective date. Unless otherwise directed by city council, the grant of tax exemption under this section shall be effective from the date that the non-profit owner began using the property for the purposes specified in the statutes referenced in subsection (a) of this section, as applicable. An exemption granted under this section may be deemed effective retroactively, but in any case, no earlier than January 1, 2003. Where retroactive application on or after January 1, 2003, is approved, the city assessor shall adjust the land book accordingly, and the city treasurer shall refund any tax, including penalty and interest, paid for the period of retroactive application. 
(e)  Revocation. In the event a property no longer qualifies for a tax exemption granted by classification or general assembly designation, the city assessor may revoke the exemption, without further action by city council being necessary. Revocation shall be required where: 
(1)  The property is no longer used for the purpose by which it qualified for exemption by classification or general assembly designation; 
(2)  The property is conveyed to another person or entity; 
(3)  The nature or function of the nonprofit organization changes such that it no longer falls within the exempt classifications or designations in the Code of Virginia. 
Upon receiving information that a property no longer qualifies for an exemption, the city assessor shall notify the owner that the exemption may be revoked and giving the reasons for said revocation. The notice shall provide the owner a reasonable time to respond in writing. Upon failure of the nonprofit organization to file a timely response or to provide convincing evidence that the property continues to qualify for the exemption, the city assessor shall revoke the exemption and provide the owner with a final written determination. Nothing herein shall preclude city council from exercising independent revocation authority or from requesting revocation by the general assembly if required by state law. Additionally, nothing herein shall prevent an applicant from requesting reinstatement of the grant of exemption should circumstances warrant. 
(f)  Validation of prior grants of exemption. All exemptions granted prior to January 1, 2003, by the general assembly or by the city under prior state law are hereby affirmed and validated. Such affirmations and validations shall not preclude revocation in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. 
(g)  Appeal of city assessor's determination. An applicant for exemption under this article may appeal the city assessor's determination to the city council within 30 days of the date of the city assessor's written determination. The appeal shall be in writing, shall state the grounds for appeal, and shall be filed with the city clerk. The decision of the city council shall be by recorded vote in open meeting. The decision shall specify whether any exemption granted shall apply to real or personal property or both and the extent of any such application. The decision of the city council shall be final.

(1)  Any preliminary or final subdivision plat submitted in accordance with the subdivision ordinance (chapter 33.1 of the city Code), which creates a lot any site development plan submitted in accordance with the zoning ordinance (chapter 40.1 of the city Code), and any application for a building permit for a principal residential structure shall include a landscape plan. The landscape plan must be drawn to the same scale as the plat or site development plan and shall clearly indicate trees to be retained or planted to meet the requirements of this article. Trees to be retained on the site shall be clearly indicated by common and botanical names; their actual location on the site; and the extent of the site covered by the canopy of each tree. Stands of five or more trees may be grouped together and shall indicate the overall area to be encompassed by their canopies. Critical protection zones for all trees to be retained, as well as a description of any protective devices proposed to comply with subsection (10) of this section, shall be indicated. Trees to be planted on the site shall be clearly indicated by botanical and common names, their proposed locations on the site; and caliper and height. The plan shall include a note indicating that trees shall be planted in conformance with subsections (9)a and (9)b of this section. When a landscape plan for a site has already been approved as part of a subdivision or site development plan for a larger development, no new landscape plan shall be required, provided that the development of the site shall comply with all other provisions of this article. 
(2)  a.  The landscape plan shall provide for the planting or replacement of trees on the site to the extent that, after 20 years, minimum tree canopy cover percentages will be provided as specified in the Table 36.1, which table has been printed at the end of this article. 
b.  Canopy cover calculations shall be made based upon data provided in "Trees and Shrubs for Virginia Landscapes," Volume 1, 1989, by Bonnie Lee Appleton and Terri Chappell for the Virginia Nurserymen's Association; "Handbook of Landscape Tree Cultivars," 1989, by Willet N. Waddell; and "Landscape Plants in Design," 1983, by E. C. Martin, Jr. If a range of distance is provided for the width of a tree, the average of the range shall be used. In cases of conflict among the references, the larger width specification shall be used. The determined width shall then be divided by two to determine the radius of the tree canopy. This radius shall be multiplied by two-thirds to obtain the 20-year radius. The area of the canopy cover of the tree shall be calculated using the 20-year radius. If no data is provided in the references for a tree proposed to be used, canopy cover of the proposed tree and the reference source used to calculate that canopy cover shall be indicated on the landscape plan. To encourage the planting of a variety of tree species, the following credit will be given for each tree: 
Calculated 20-Year Tree Canopy (Square Feet) 	Allowed Credit (Square Feet) 
0300 	300 
3001,000 	1,000 
1,001 + 	2,000 
 
(3)  The area of a site to be used in calculating canopy cover shall be the area of the zone lot or the actual size of the lot at the time of plan submittal, as defined in chapter 40.1. 
(4)  a.  Trees shall be selected from those listed on the City of Portsmouth's approved lists which shall be maintained by the environmental manager or the city manager's designee and which may be amended as necessary by the city manager or his designee. Substitutions using trees not on the list may be made with the approval of the director or the director's designee. No tree from the list of nonacceptable trees may be used. 
b.  Small trees with single stems must have a caliper of 1½ inches at the time of planting. Multistem trees must be a minimum of five feet in height at time of planting. Medium trees must have a minimum caliper of 1½ inches and large trees must have a minimum caliper of two inches at time of planting. All trees must be planted in accordance with the planting specifications of subsection (9) of this section. 
(5)  Trees existing on the site may be used to satisfy the canopy coverage requirements of subsection (2) of this section. The landscape plan must identify such trees. Trees must be physically and structurally in good condition. All such trees on the site during construction must be protected in accordance with the provisions of subsection (10) of this section. Stands of five or more trees shall be credited canopy area equal to that covered at the time of application for approval of the landscape plan. 
(6)  Existing or proposed street trees planted or to be planted along the street in the public right-of-way may be used to satisfy the canopy coverage requirements. All trees must be approved by the director or the director's designee as required in subsection (7) of this section. 
(7)  No landscape plan shall be approved unless the director or the director's designee makes the following certifications: 
a.  All existing trees to be retained in compliance with the requirements of this article are physically and structurally sound; 
b.  Where street trees are proposed, the landscape plan provides for acceptable spacing, lawn area and species selection in relation to streets, sidewalks, utilities, traffic sight lines and parking areas. 
(8)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any part of the development until the trees required by subsection (1) of this section for that part have been planted and all such trees have been determined to be physically and structurally sound by the director or by the director's designee. In lieu of actual planting, an applicant for a certificate of occupancy may post a bond or other form of security acceptable to the city attorney to ensure the timely completion of the approval tree planting plan. 
(9)  All trees to be planted shall be installed in conformance with the following criteria: 
a.  All trees to be planted in accordance with "American Standards for Nursery Stock," published by the American Association of Nurserymen. All trees shall be balled and burlapped or container-grown. 
b.  All trees shall be installed in accordance with the road and bridge specifications of the Virginia Department of Transportation and "Landscape Planting and Protection Manual, Portsmouth, Virginia." 
c.  The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all trees located on the property. Where trees are installed in accordance with the provisions of this article, it shall be the responsibility of the lot owner to maintain the trees. The trees must be maintained, alive, for a period of one year. If any of the trees dies during the first year after planting, it must be replaced by the owner. 
(10)  Trees to be retained on the lot in accordance with the approved landscape plan shall be protected utilizing methods prescribed in "Landscape Planting and Protection Manual, Portsmouth, Virginia." 
a.  Trees or tree areas that are to be retained shall be marked visibly in the field prior to clearing or construction by use of one of the methods specified in the "Landscape Planting and Protection Manual, Portsmouth, Virginia." 
b.  Protection devices shall be installed prior to clearing or construction and shall be shown on the submitted landscape plan. Such devices shall be evident and effective and shall be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain such devices shall be cause for the issuance of a stop work order. Construction personnel shall be notified of the purpose and presence of the protection devices. 
c.  If it becomes necessary subsequent to clearing to remove additional trees which were shown on the approved plan to be retained, such trees may be removed if compliance with the required canopy coverage and all other requirements of this article are maintained and a revised landscape plan is approved.

The planning director may grant a partial exception to the requirements of this article under the circumstances listed in this section: 
(1)  Such exception shall reduce the required tree canopy by the minimum extent necessary to provide a reasonable buildable area. 
(2)  Exceptions may be granted under the following conditions: 
a.  Where the planning director finds that the combined requirements of this article, the zoning ordinance, any ordinances adopted in compliance with the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, or the requirements of chapter 39 of the city Code for the protection of tidal wetlands would result in the elimination of a reasonably developable area on the site. 
b.  Where the proposed use of the property is agriculture, outdoor recreation, or aviation and the planning director finds that full compliance with this article would unreasonably reduce the unwooded area of the site necessary for such use. 
c.  Where the proposed development is an expansion of an existing development on the same zone lot, the procedure for calculating required tree canopy coverage shall be modified by substituting the term "construction footprint" for the term "zone lot" in section 36-52(3).

40.1-1.5 - Conformance with Adopted Plans 
This Ordinance is intended to ensure that all development within the city's jurisdiction is consistent with the goals, objectives, policies, strategies, and actions of the Destination 2025 Comprehensive Plan and any other adopted plans addressing the city's growth and development. To the extent this Ordinance is or becomes inconsistent with these adopted plans, it should be amended to become or remain consistent with the adopted plans. Additionally, all amendments to this Ordinance's text or official zoning map should maintain and enhance consistency between this Ordinance and the adopted plans.  
40.1-1.6 - Relationship with Other Laws, Covenants, or Deed Restrictions 
(A)  Conflicts with Other City Codes or Laws If a provision of this Ordinance is inconsistent with a provision found in other adopted codes or ordinances of the city, the more restrictive provision shall govern unless the terms of the more restrictive provision specify otherwise. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions or burdens, or more stringent controls.

40.1-1.7 - Official Zoning Map 
(A)  General The official zoning map designates the location and boundaries of the various base zoning and overlay zoning districts established in this Ordinance. The official zoning map shall be kept on file in the Planning Department and is available for public inspection during normal business hours. The original official version of the map shall be certified by the Planning Director. It may be kept in either hardcopy or digital form. It shall be the final authority as to the status of the current zoning district classification of land in the city, and shall only be amended in accordance with this Ordinance. 
(B)  Incorporated by Reference. The official zoning map and all the notations thereon is incorporated herein by reference and made part of this Ordinance. 
(C)  Damaged, Destroyed, or Lost In the event the official zoning map is damaged, destroyed, lost, or becomes difficult to read and interpret due to the number of changes, the City Council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map to replace the damaged, destroyed, or lost map. The new official zoning map shall not make any substantive changes (amendments), but may correct drafting and other clerical errors and omissions on the previous official zoning map. 
(D)  Interpretation of Official Zoning Map Boundaries The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for interpretations of the official zoning map in accordance with the standards in Section 40.1-2.3.L, Interpretation, and the following standards: 
(1)  Boundaries shown as approximately following a utility line or a street, alley, railroad, or other public access way shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the right-of-way or easement for the utility line or access way. 
(2)  Boundaries shown as approximately following a property line shall be interpreted as following the property line as it existed when the boundary was established. If a single subsequent minor adjustment (such as from settlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the property line moving 10 feet or less, the zoning boundary shall be interpreted as moving with the property line. 
(3)  Where areas under water are not shown within the same district as the adjacent land areas, the boundaries of the zoning districts shown for such adjacent land areas shall extend to the mean low-water line along the property lines of the owners of such adjacent land areas. 
(4)  Boundaries shown as approximately following established municipal corporate limits or other political boundaries shall be interpreted as following the corporate limits or boundaries. 
(5)  Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be interpreted as such. 
(6)  If the specific location of a depicted boundary cannot be determined from notations on the official zoning map or application of the above standards, it shall be determined by using the map's scale to determine the boundary's distance from other features shown on the map. 
(7)  Where the actual locations of existing physical or natural features vary from that shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by this subsection, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to interpret the district boundaries (See Section 40.1-2.3.L, Interpretation). Appeals of the Zoning Administrator's decision shall be reviewed by the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3.M, Appeal. 
(8)  In every case where property has not been specifically included within a zoning district, the land shall automatically be designated as Preservation/Government (PG) until such classification is changed by an amendment to this Ordinance in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3.A, Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment. 
(E)  Amendments to the Official Zoning Map Changes made in zoning district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the official zoning map shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance (Section 40.1-2.3.A, Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment). Changes shall be entered on the official zoning map by the Planning Director promptly after the amendment is approved by the City Council. Where the ordinance enacting a zoning district boundary change contains wording explaining or clarifying the location of the new boundary, the Planning Director may enter on the official zoning map notations reflecting the ordinance wording. The Planning Director shall maintain copies of superseded versions of the official zoning map for historical reference. 
(F)  Uses Generally This Ordinance shall be deemed exclusive in nature and only those uses specified shall be permitted in the various zoning districts. If a use is not specified in a zoning district, it shall be prohibited in that district. In the event that a use is not permitted in any zoning district, it may only be permitted after appropriate amendment to the text of this Ordinance. 
(G)  Bifurcation Discouraged Applications seeking to amend the official zoning map (rezoning) to establish or maintain two or more different base zoning district designations on a single lot are discouraged. 
(H)  Transition to New Zoning Districts On May 1, 2010, land zoned with a zoning district classification from the previous zoning ordinance shall be translated or reclassified to one of the zoning district classifications in this Ordinance as set forth in Article 40.1-3: Zoning Districts. Table 40.1-1.7(H), Transition to New Zoning Districts, summarizes the translation or reclassification of the zoning districts used in the previous zoning ordinance to the zoning districts used in this Ordinance. (For example, Table 40.1-1.7(H) shows that all lands classified Residential RS-300 in the previous zoning ordinance are classified Neighborhood Residential (NR) in this Ordinance.)

(1)  Purpose   
(a)  The purpose of a variance permit is to allow certain deviations from the standards of this Ordinance (such as size of area of a lot or parcel of land, or the size, area, bulk, or location of a building or structure), when the land owner demonstrates that, owing to special circumstances or conditions beyond the land owner's control (such as exceptional topographical conditions, narrowness, shallowness, or the shape of a specific parcel of land), the literal application of the standards of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary or unreasonable hardship to the land owner and the need for the variance is not shared generally by other lands, and the deviation is not contrary to the public interest or goals and purposes of this Ordinance. 
(b)  A variance shall not include a change in use, which shall be accomplished through an amendment to the official zoning map (Section 40.1-2.3(A), Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment).

c.  Denial of the application. 
(4)  Variance Standards   
(a)  Findings An application for a variance permit shall be approved upon a finding that all of the following standards are met: 
(i)  The land for which the variance is requested is acquired in good faith; 
(ii)  The land is subject to: 
a.  Exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size, or shape; 
b.  Exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition; or 
(iii)  The situation is not self-created; 
(iv)  Because of one or several conditions identified in Section 40.1-2.3(G)(4), Variance Standards, the strict application of this Ordinance would produce undue hardship, and effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the land; 
(v)  The hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; 
(vi)  The authorization of the variance alleviates this clearly demonstrated hardship (as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant);

(xi)  The variance authorized by the BZA is the least possible deviation from the standards necessary to afford relief. 
(b)  Prohibitions   
(i)  No provision of this Ordinance shall be construed as granting the BZA the power to rezone property.

Conditions, where imposed, shall be included as part of the approval. 
(b)  The BZA may require a guarantee or bond to insure compliance with the conditions imposed. 
(6)  Effect of Decision   
(a)  Issuance of a variance permit shall authorize only the particular variance that is approved. A variance permit, including any conditions, shall run with the land and not be affected by a change in ownership. 
 
(b)  Development authorized by the variance permit shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits required by this Ordinance or any other applicable ordinances and regulations of the city. A variance permit, in itself, shall not ensure that the development approved through a variance permit shall receive subsequent approval for any other necessary applications for permit or development approval. 
(7)  Expiration   
(a)  The BZA may prescribe, as part of a variance permit, a time within which development activity shall begin, be completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete such development within the time specified shall render the variance permit void, and the permit shall automatically expire.

(i)  The property is used as it was historically or is given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(ii)  The historic character of the property is retained and preserved. 
(iii)  The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize the property is avoided.

(xi)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction is undertaken in a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment is unimpaired. 
(c)  It is not the intent of the city or this Ordinance to discourage contemporary architectural expression, or to require the emulation of existing structures of historic or architectural interest in specific detail. Harmony or incompatibility shall be evaluated in terms of the appropriateness of the architectural features, materials, scale, size, height, and placement of a new structure in relationship to existing structures and to the setting.

(12)  Demolition by Neglect   
(a)  Allowing a historic structure within a historic district to deteriorate due to neglect is a violation of this Ordinance. Deterioration due to neglect shall constitute demolition by neglect when: 
(i)  Deterioration of the exterior of a building occurs to the extent that it creates, or permits, a hazardous or unsafe condition; or 
(ii)  Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports, horizontal members, roofs, chimneys, exterior wall elements such as siding, wooden walls, brick, plaster, or mortar occurs to the extent that it adversely affects the character of the district or could reasonably lead to irreversible damage to the structure or lead to a hazardous condition. 
(b)  The HPC or DDC, as appropriate, shall monitor the condition of historic properties for demolition by neglect. In the event that the HPC or DDC receives a complaint or determines that a structure is being demolished by neglect, it shall notify the Planning Director, and describe the actions needed to address the violation. 
(13)  Undue Hardship   
(a)  The HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall have the power to reduce or suspend any of the requirements of this section, if the historic structure presents special circumstances whereby the strict compliance of this section will produce an undue hardship or if the spirit of the section has been met and deviation has been deemed to be in the best interest of the city. 
(b)  In granting a hardship the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall make the following findings of fact in writing: 
(i)  Strict compliance with the regulation provides the property owner no reasonable use of the property; 
(ii)  The hardship results from application of the regulation to the property; 
(iii)  The hardship is one that affects the property directly; 
(iv)  The hardship is not the result of the property owner's own actionsthat is, special circumstances or conditions causing the hardship exist through no fault of the property owner; 
(v)  The hardship is peculiar to the property; 
(vi)  Financial considerations, unless they greatly decrease or destroy the property's value, do not constitute a legal hardship; and 
(vii)  That the condition or situation of the property concerned is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this Ordinance. 
(14)  Conditions of Approval   
(a)  The HPC or DDC (as appropriate), may approve a COA with conditions where it deems the conditions necessary to meet the applicable standards and guidelines as well as the requirements of this Ordinance. 
(b)  If the application does not meet the city's adopted standards and guidelines or the applicant does not agree to the proposed conditions, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall deny the request. Under no circumstance shall the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), approve a set of conditions without the applicant's approval. 
(15)  Effect of Decision Where the exterior appearance of any historic structure is involved: 
(a)  No building permit shall be issued for erection, alteration or improvement, unless a COA has first been issued; 
(b)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the project is constructed in compliance with the COA; 
(c)  Exterior alterations that do not require a building permit but which can change the exterior appearance of the building or structure such as replacement of doors and windows shall not be constructed or installed unless a COA has first been obtained; 
(d)  During construction or installation, the COA shall be posted on the property in a location where it is visible from the public right-of-way and a complete set of the approved plans shall be retained on the premises and shall be made available to designated staff; 
(e)  In cases of denial where the proposed change would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a COA by the HPC shall be binding upon the designated staff charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
(16)  Transfer A COA shall be transferable to subsequent owners of the property for which the certificate is issued. 
(17)  Expiration   
(a)  An approved COA shall be valid for a period of one year from date of issuance. All work approved and initiated under a COA shall be completed within one year of issuance. 
(b)  Without an approved extension, after one year from issuance of a COA, an owner shall obtain a new certificate in order to commence any previously approved work or to complete any work. Once begun, no project or work shall be left partially- completed. 
(c)  On written request from the applicant, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), may grant a single extension of its approval for a period of up to one additional year if, based upon submissions from the applicant, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), finds that conditions on the site and in the area of the proposed project are essentially the same as when approval was originally granted. 
(d)  Any COA shall also expire and become null and void if such authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of one year after being commenced. Any period or periods of time during which the right to use any such certificate or permit is stayed pursuant to this chapter shall be excluded from the computation of the 12 months. 
(18)  Amendment A COA may be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original approval. 
(19)  Appeals   
(a)  General Appeals from any action or decision of the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), in granting or refusing to grant a COA a permit pursuant to the provisions of this article may be taken to the City Council for review, by setting forth in writing the alleged error of the action or decision of the HPC or DDC (as appropriate),, provided such petition is: 
(i)  Filed within 30 days after the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), final decision; and 
(ii)  Further provided that the basis for such appeal shall be limited to an alleged error by the HPC in finding that the proposed erection, alteration, reconstruction, or restoration of a structure would not be architecturally compatible with the historic properties, buildings, or structures within the historic district. 
(b)  Procedure for Appeals of HPC or DDC Decisions   
(i)  An Appeal Review Committee (ARC) shall be created consisting of the Planning Director, the Building Official and a Deputy City Manager designated by the City Manager to determine whether there are legitimate grounds for such an appeal before placing the appeal on the City Council agenda. 
(ii)  Upon the filing of an appeal, the ARC shall review the request to determine if there are grounds for appeal based on Sections 40.1-2.3(I) (9), and (10). 
(iii)  If the ARC finds that there are no grounds for appeal, they shall notify the applicant in writing of their decision. An appeal of the ARC's decision may be taken by the applicant to the circuit court of the City of Portsmouth for review by filing a petition at law which sets forth the alleged error of the action or decision provided that such petition is filed within 30 days after the final decision is rendered by the ARC. 
(iv)  If the ARC finds that there are grounds for appeal, they shall forward the request to the City Clerk so the matter may be placed on the City Council agenda. When a matter is forwarded to the City Council, a written conclusion from the ARC shall accompany the appeal. 
(v)  City Council shall hear the appeal and either reverse or affirm the decision of the HPC based on an error in findings. 
(vi)  If City Council fails to reverse the HPC's findings and upholds the HPC decision, an appeal may be taken by the applicant to the circuit court of the City of Portsmouth for review by filing a petition at law which sets forth the alleged error of the action or decision provided that such petition is filed within 30 days after the final decision is rendered by the City Council. 
(c)  Procedure for Appeals of Planning Director Decisions An appeal from the Planning Director's decision on a COA application shall be reviewed and decided by the BZA in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3(K), Appeal. 
(d)  Stay Filing of an appeal, whether an appeal of the HPC, DDC, ARC, or City Council's decision, shall stay the appealed decision pending outcome of the appeal except that such filing will not stay the decision if such decision denies the right to raze or demolish a building or structure. 
(20)  Violations Failure to obtain a COA or performance of work that surpasses or is in conflict with an approved COA is a violation of this Ordinance, and is subject to the applicable remedies in Article 40-1.7: Enforcement.

If within six months of the date the letter is sent out the Planning Director determines the situation is continuing, the Planning Director may initiate proceedings to revoke the use permit. However, if at any time during the course of this process, the Chief of Police determines there is a significant risk to public safety or peace and good order as to create a risk of blight that must be corrected immediately, the Planning Director may initiate proceedings to revoke the use permit immediately, without waiting six months for the permittee to correct the problem. 
(9)  Amendments A use permit may be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original approval.

However, approval of a special exception shall be required, in accordance with this section, when either of the conditions below are present, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator: 
(i)  There is a fifteen (15) percent or greater net increase in the square footage of the use or structure proposed for expansion or enlargement; or 
(ii)  The expansion or enlargement will substantially alter the site design and layout as it relates to circulation, parking or other site characteristics so as to adversely affect surrounding properties, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.

(i)  The land for which the variance is requested is acquired in good faith; 
(ii)  The land is subject to: 
a.  Exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size, or shape; 
b.  Exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition; or 
(iii)  The situation is not self-created; 
(iv)  Because of one or several conditions identified in Section 40.1-2.3(G)(4), Variance Standards, the strict application of this Ordinance would produce undue hardship, and effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the land; 
(v)  The hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; 
(vi)  The authorization of the variance alleviates this clearly demonstrated hardship (as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant);

(i)  No provision of this Ordinance shall be construed as granting the BZA the power to rezone property. 
(ii)  No variance shall be granted to allow a use or development condition not permitted by right or proffer. 
(iii)  No variance shall be granted to any standard or requirement in any other part of the City Code of Ordinances.

(H)  Administrative Adjustment   
(1)  Purpose and Intent This purpose and intent of this section is to provide an administrative mechanism for allowing minor variations, or adjustments, to the building setback standards of this Ordinance based on specific standards, with the intent of providing relief where application of a standard creates practical difficulties in allowing development that otherwise advances the purposes served by this Ordinance and is compatible with surrounding lands.

(i)  The property is used as it was historically or is given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(ii)  The historic character of the property is retained and preserved. 
(iii)  The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize the property is avoided. 
(iv)  Each property is recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, are not undertaken. 
(v)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right are retained and preserved. 
(vi)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property are preserved. 
(vii)  Deteriorated historic features are repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature matches the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features is substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(viii)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, are undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials are not used. 
(ix)  Archeological resources are protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures are undertaken. 
(x)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction does not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work is differentiated from the old and is compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(xi)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction is undertaken in a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment is unimpaired. 
(c)  It is not the intent of the city or this Ordinance to discourage contemporary architectural expression, or to require the emulation of existing structures of historic or architectural interest in specific detail. Harmony or incompatibility shall be evaluated in terms of the appropriateness of the architectural features, materials, scale, size, height, and placement of a new structure in relationship to existing structures and to the setting. 
(d)  In making this determination, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall further consider compatibility with the standards and guidelines as adopted by City Council, with accompanying additions and amendments, in addition to any other pertinent factors. 
(10)  Certificate of Appropriateness for Relocation   
(a)  Procedure All COA applications for relocation shall be reviewed by the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), pursuant to Section 40.1-2.3(I)(7), Procedure for HPC Review of Certificates of Appropriateness. 
(b)  Relocation Criteria A decision by the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), approving, approving with conditions, or denying a COA for the relocation of an historic structure, building, site, or object shall be based on: 
(i)  The historic, scenic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, or object; 
(ii)  The importance of the historic structure, site, or object to the ambiance of a district; 
(iii)  Whether there are definite plans for the property to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be; 
(iv)  Whether the historic structure, building, site, or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and

(11)  Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition   
(a)  Procedure All COA applications for demolition shall be reviewed by the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), pursuant to Section 40.1-2.3(I)(7), Procedure for HPC Review of Certificates of Appropriateness.

(ii)  If preservation is found to be both physically and economically feasible, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall take or promote the taking of whatever public or private action that seems likely to lead to such preservation, either on the site on which the historic structure is located or on another site to which it might appropriately be moved. 
(iii)  Where preservation is feasible but the applicant still seeks demolition, the following provisions of Section 40.1-2.3(I)(10)(d), Right to Demolish, from the Code of Virginia may be undertaken while alternatives for preservation are sought. 
(c)  Demolition Criteria A decision by the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), approving or denying a COA for the demolition of an historic structures, buildings, site, or objects shall be based on: 
(i)  The historic, scenic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, or object; 
(ii)  The importance of the historic structure, building, site, or object to the ambiance of a district; 
(iii)  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a structure, building, site, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location; 
(iv)  Whether the historic structure, building, site, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city; 
(v)  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
(vi)  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the historic structure, building, site, or object from collapse; and 
(vii)  Whether the historic structure, building, site, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value.

(ii)  The land owner has made a bona fide offer to sell the structure, building, site, or object, and the land pertaining therein for the time period established in Table 40.1-2.3(I), Time Schedule for Selling Property, and at a price reasonably related to its fair market value. Such offer must be made to the city or to any other person, government, or agency, which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to preserve and restore the structure, building, site, or object and the land pertaining thereto; 
(iii)  No bona fide contract, binding upon all parties thereto, shall have been executed for the sale of any such building, structure, site, or object and the land pertaining thereto, prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in Table 40.1-2.3(I), Time Schedule for Selling Property. Any appeal which may be taken to the court from the decision of the City Council, whether instituted by the owner or by any other proper party, notwithstanding the provisions heretofore stated relating to a stay of the decision appealed from, shall not affect the right of the owner to make the bona fide offer to sell referred to above; 
(iv)  No offer to sell shall be made more than one year after a final decision by the City Council, but thereafter the owner may renew his request to the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), to approve the demolition of the historic landmark, building, or structure.

(12)  Demolition by Neglect   
(a)  Allowing a historic structure within a historic district to deteriorate due to neglect is a violation of this Ordinance. Deterioration due to neglect shall constitute demolition by neglect when: 
(i)  Deterioration of the exterior of a building occurs to the extent that it creates, or permits, a hazardous or unsafe condition; or 
(ii)  Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports, horizontal members, roofs, chimneys, exterior wall elements such as siding, wooden walls, brick, plaster, or mortar occurs to the extent that it adversely affects the character of the district or could reasonably lead to irreversible damage to the structure or lead to a hazardous condition. 
(b)  The HPC or DDC, as appropriate, shall monitor the condition of historic properties for demolition by neglect. In the event that the HPC or DDC receives a complaint or determines that a structure is being demolished by neglect, it shall notify the Planning Director, and describe the actions needed to address the violation. 
(13)  Undue Hardship   
(a)  The HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall have the power to reduce or suspend any of the requirements of this section, if the historic structure presents special circumstances whereby the strict compliance of this section will produce an undue hardship or if the spirit of the section has been met and deviation has been deemed to be in the best interest of the city. 
(b)  In granting a hardship the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall make the following findings of fact in writing: 
(i)  Strict compliance with the regulation provides the property owner no reasonable use of the property; 
(ii)  The hardship results from application of the regulation to the property; 
(iii)  The hardship is one that affects the property directly; 
(iv)  The hardship is not the result of the property owner's own actionsthat is, special circumstances or conditions causing the hardship exist through no fault of the property owner; 
(v)  The hardship is peculiar to the property; 
(vi)  Financial considerations, unless they greatly decrease or destroy the property's value, do not constitute a legal hardship; and 
(vii)  That the condition or situation of the property concerned is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this Ordinance. 
(14)  Conditions of Approval   
(a)  The HPC or DDC (as appropriate), may approve a COA with conditions where it deems the conditions necessary to meet the applicable standards and guidelines as well as the requirements of this Ordinance. 
(b)  If the application does not meet the city's adopted standards and guidelines or the applicant does not agree to the proposed conditions, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), shall deny the request. Under no circumstance shall the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), approve a set of conditions without the applicant's approval. 
(15)  Effect of Decision Where the exterior appearance of any historic structure is involved: 
(a)  No building permit shall be issued for erection, alteration or improvement, unless a COA has first been issued; 
(b)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the project is constructed in compliance with the COA; 
(c)  Exterior alterations that do not require a building permit but which can change the exterior appearance of the building or structure such as replacement of doors and windows shall not be constructed or installed unless a COA has first been obtained; 
(d)  During construction or installation, the COA shall be posted on the property in a location where it is visible from the public right-of-way and a complete set of the approved plans shall be retained on the premises and shall be made available to designated staff; 
(e)  In cases of denial where the proposed change would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a COA by the HPC shall be binding upon the designated staff charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
(16)  Transfer A COA shall be transferable to subsequent owners of the property for which the certificate is issued. 
(17)  Expiration   
(a)  An approved COA shall be valid for a period of one year from date of issuance. All work approved and initiated under a COA shall be completed within one year of issuance. 
(b)  Without an approved extension, after one year from issuance of a COA, an owner shall obtain a new certificate in order to commence any previously approved work or to complete any work. Once begun, no project or work shall be left partially- completed. 
(c)  On written request from the applicant, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), may grant a single extension of its approval for a period of up to one additional year if, based upon submissions from the applicant, the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), finds that conditions on the site and in the area of the proposed project are essentially the same as when approval was originally granted. 
(d)  Any COA shall also expire and become null and void if such authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of one year after being commenced. Any period or periods of time during which the right to use any such certificate or permit is stayed pursuant to this chapter shall be excluded from the computation of the 12 months. 
(18)  Amendment A COA may be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original approval. 
(19)  Appeals   
(a)  General Appeals from any action or decision of the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), in granting or refusing to grant a COA a permit pursuant to the provisions of this article may be taken to the City Council for review, by setting forth in writing the alleged error of the action or decision of the HPC or DDC (as appropriate),, provided such petition is: 
(i)  Filed within 30 days after the HPC or DDC (as appropriate), final decision; and

(Ord. No. 2015-83 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2015)  
40.1-3.5 - Activity Center (AC) Zoning Districts 
(A)  General Purposes The Activity Center (AC) base zoning districts are established and intended to encourage high-quality land planning and site design concepts that: 
(1)  Implement the comprehensive plan and the future land use map by establishing a series of activity centers in designated locations around the city; 
(2)  Promote mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly land use patterns within designated activity centers; 
(3)  Allow greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and nonresidential land uses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities; 
(4)  Establish inter-connected developments that provide greater pedestrian orientation, vehicular connectivity, and support for alternative methods of transportation; 
(5)  Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lowering development and housing costs; and 
(6)  Promote environmentally-sensitive and sustainable development that respects surrounding established land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-made features, such as trees, streams, hillsides, floodplains, and historic features. 
(B)  Classification of Activity Center Zoning Districts Land shall be classified into an AC district only in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 40.1-2.3(A), Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment, and the standards in this section. 
(C)  Relationship to MX/EMP Districts Lands designated as Mixed-Use/Employment Center (MX/EMP) on April 30, 2010 are subject to the regulations, standards and conditions included within the previously-adopted zoning ordinance, master plans and other requirements related to their approval. These developments may proceed subject to their original approvals in accordance with Section 40.1-1.8, Transitional Rules. In the event the development approval associated with an MX/EMP district expires, or a modification to development within these districts is proposed, the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply. 
(D)  Organization of Activity Center District Regulations Section 40.1-3.5(E), Procedure for Establishing an AC District, describes the review process and application elements. Section 40.1-3.5(F), General Standards for All Activity Center Districts, sets out general standards applicable to all activity center districts. Sections 40.1-3.5(G) to 40.1-3.5(I) set out the individual district-specific standards for each of the three types of AC districts. These sections have a common structure consisting of a purpose statement, applicable district standards, and example development configurations. 
(E)  Procedure Applications for establishment of an AC district shall be reviewed as an amendment to the Official Zoning Map in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3(A), Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment, and the following standards: 
(1)  Master Plan Required Applications for AC districts shall include a master plan reviewed by the City Council as part of the amendment to the Official Zoning Map. The master plan shall illustrate the conceptual layout of proposed uses, streets, buildings, lots, and other elements of the proposed development when fully developed. Required elements of the master plan shall include: 
(a)  Location and mix of proposed land uses; 
(b)  Number (density and intensity), type, and mix of land uses for the district as a whole as well as for each sub-area within the district; 
(c)  Proposed block and lot standards, including: block length, lot size, lot width, and lot coverage; 
(d)  Building dimensional standards, including: building footprints, yard setbacks, proposed heights, and lot coverage; 
(e)  Pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems; 
(f)  Parking and loading locations and quantity; 
(g)  Location of public facilities; 
(h)  Location, type, amount, and ownership of open space; 
(i)  Stormwater management areas; and 
(j)  A conceptual landscaping plan, including: street trees, appropriate buffers and screens, signage and public art. 
Development within an AC district shall conform to the requirements of the approved master plan. 
(2)  Statement of Design Standards Required In addition to a master plan, applications for an AC district shall also provide a statement of design standards in the form of graphics and explanatory text illustrating how buildings, circulation systems, landscaping, and other elements of the master plan will meet the general and district-specific standards of the AC district and other relevant requirements in this Ordinance. The statement of design standards shall, at a minimum, address all of the following: 
(a)  Architectural form, materials, and other guidelines for proposed buildings; 
(b)  Off-street parking design; 
(c)  Fence and wall standards; 
(d)  Exterior lighting standards; 
(e)  Signage descriptions, sizes, and examples; 
(f)  Street hierarchy (collector streets, local streets, alleys, etc.); 
(g)  Street tree planting, landscaping, and drainage; 
(h)  Provision of bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and crosswalks; 
(i)  A traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with Section 40.1-5.12, Transportation Analysis; 
(j)  A scheduling/phasing plan, if applicable; and 
(k)  Property owners' association documents specifying maintenance, membership, and member responsibilities. 
(3)  Conversion Schedule The AC master plan may include a conversion schedule that identifies the extent to which one type of residential use may be converted to another type of residential use and one type of nonresidential use may be converted to another type of nonresidential use (i.e., residential to residential, or nonresidential to nonresidential). These conversions may occur within development areas and between development areas, as long as they occur within the same development phase, as identified by the approved development phasing plan, and are consistent with established extents of conversion set down in the conversion schedule. 
(4)  Development Phasing Plan If development in the AC district is proposed to be phased, the master plan shall include a development phasing plan that identifies the general sequence or phases proposed to be developed, including how residential and nonresidential development will be timed, how infrastructure (public and private) and open space will be provided and timed, and how development will be coordinated with the city's capital improvements program. 
(5)  Amendment to Master Plan or Statement of Design Standards   
(a)  Amendments   
(i)  General If an applicant determines it is necessary to alter the concept or intent of the master plan or statement of design standards, the master plan or statement shall be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards for its original approval. 
(ii)  Amendments Defined The following items are considered an alteration of the concept or intent of the master plan or statement of design standards and are treated as an amendment: 
a.  Changes in use designations; 
b.  Density/intensity increases; 
c.  Decreases in open space; 
d.  Substantial changes in the location of streets (particularly if streets are to be deleted or access points to the development moved so traffic flows both inside and outside the development are affected); 
e.  Change in the location of any public easement; 
f.  Change in the proportion of housing types by more than 10 percent; 
g.  Substantial changes to the design or materials of structures; or 
h.  Violation of any specific condition of the master plan or statement of design standards. 
(b)  Minor Deviations Subsequent plans and permits for development within an approved AC district may include minor deviations from the master plan or statement of design standards, provided such deviations are limited to changes addressing technical considerations that could not reasonably be anticipated during the zoning classification process or any other change that has no material effect on the character of the approved activity center district or any of its requirements. The following shall constitute minor deviations: 
(i)  Driveway locations; 
(ii)  Structure floor plan revisions; 
(iii)  Minor shifts in building size or location; and 
(iv)  Facility design modifications for amenities and the like. 
Changes that materially affect the basic concept of the master plan or basic parameters set by the statement of design standards are not considered minor deviations, and shall only be changed as amendments to the AC district. 
(F)  General Standards for All Activity Center Districts   
(1)  Consistency with City Plans The AC zoning district designation, the master plan, and the statement of design standards shall be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and any other applicable plans adopted by the city. 
(2)  Compatibility with Surrounding Areas Development along the perimeter of an AC district shall be compatible with adjacent existing or proposed development. Where there are issues of compatibility, the master plan shall provide for transition areas at the edges of the AC district that provide appropriate buffering or ensure a complementary character of uses and development patterns. Determination of complementary character shall be based on densities/intensities, lot size and dimensions, building height, building mass and scale, hours of operation, exterior lighting, and siting of service areas. 
(3)  Use Regulations   
(a)  Article 40.1-4, Use Standards, includes a summary use table specifying the allowable uses for each of the AC districts (See Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table) subject to an approved master plan. Uses with an "A" under a particular AC district column are allowed subject to an approved master plan and statement of design standards. 
(b)  Uses that do not include an "A" under a particular AC district column in Table 40.1-4.1(A) are prohibited within that AC district. 
(c)  Any applicable use-specific standard shall also apply within an AC district unless the approved master plan and statement of design standards indicate otherwise. 
(4)  Street Standards In approving an AC district master plan, the City Council may approve modifications or reductions of city street design standards, but all AC districts shall comply with the following requirements:

The waiver shall be in writing, and shall become a part of the AC master plan. 
Page left blank Intentionally 
(G) Neighborhood Activity Center (NAC) District 
PURPOSE AND INTENT 
The NAC district is established primarily to accommodate mixed, pedestrian-scaled, neighborhood-serving nonresidential and high-density residential uses in the same structure or in close proximity. Nonresidential uses may include small-scale retail, service, and professional offices that provide goods and services to the residents of the surrounding neighborhood. Nonresidential uses should typically be located at the intersection of two collector streets or a collector street and arterial street. Residential uses are encouraged on the upper floors of nonresidential establishments. There are no minimum lot sizes, but residential densities are limited to a maximum of 18 units per gross acre. Establishment of single-tenant nonresidential buildings exceeding 5,000 square feet and multiple-tenant nonresidential buildings exceeding 10,000 square feet shall require a use permit (See Section 40.1-2.3(B), Use Permit.). Mass transit facilities and pedestrian-friendly elements are important components of development in these centers, in order to reduce demand for auto travel as well as increase visual interest. All development in the district is subject to an approved master plan and statement of design standards.

(I) Regional Activity Center (RAC) District 
PURPOSE AND INTENT 
The RAC district is intended to encourage and facilitate the development of distinctive, attractive regional centers containing a mix of concentrated land uses. These high-quality and highly visible regional activity centers are intended to serve as Portsmouth's "image-makers." The centers should include major economic generators, most with a regional market draw, such as regional shopping, major employers, large educational facilities, restaurants, theaters, hotels, and relatively dense office development. The area should contain a broad mix of complementary uses, including high-density multi-family housing, major civic and public facilities, parks, and open space. Mass transit facilities and pedestrian-friendly elements are important components of development in these centers, in order to reduce demand for auto travel as well as increase visual interest. All development in the district is subject to an approved master plan and statement of design standards.

(4)  Relationship to Other Zoning Districts Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district, unless expressly stated otherwise in these regulations. If the standards governing an overlay zoning district expressly conflict with those governing a base zoning district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control, unless expressly stated otherwise in these regulations. Where land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay zoning district expressly conflict with those governing another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply. 
(B)  Master-Planned Overlay (MPO) District   
(1)  Purpose The Master-Planned Overlay (MPO) district is intended to provide an opportunity for the establishment of new development that departs from the range of dimensional and development standards typically applied to development in the city, subject to a proffered master plan. The minimum quality of development in the MPO district is anticipated to exceed the level that would otherwise result from the strict application of the typical range of dimensional and development standards. 
(2)  Applicability The MPO district is available for application to lands of two acres in size or greater located outside of an existing Activity Center district or location where an activity center district designation is anticipated by the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Procedure The MPO district is established in accordance with the procedure and requirements for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3(A), Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment, and the standards in this section. 
(4)  Standards Before approving a MPO zoning district classification, the City Council shall find that the application for the MPO zoning district classification, as well as the master plan and the terms and conditions included as part of the application, comply with the following standards: 
(a)  MPO Master Plan The MPO Master Plan shall: 
(i)  Include a statement of planning objectives for the district; 
(ii)  Identify the general location of individual development areas, identified by land use(s) and/or development density or intensity; 
(iii)  Identify for the entire MPO district and each development area the acreage, types and mix of land uses, number of residential units (by use type), nonresidential floor area (by use type), residential density, and nonresidential intensity; 
(iv)  Identify the general location, amount, and type (whether designated for active or passive recreation) of open space; 
(v)  Identify the location of environmentally sensitive lands, wildlife habitat, and stream corridors; 
(vi)  Identify the on-site transportation circulation system, including the general location of all public and private streets, existing or projected transit corridors, and pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and how they will connect with existing and planned city systems; 
(vii)  Identify the general location of on-site potable water and wastewater facilities, and how they will connect to city systems; 
(viii)  Identify the general location of on-site stormwater management facilities, and how they will connect to city systems; and 
(ix)  Identify the general location of all other on-site public facilities serving the development, including but not limited to parks, schools, and facilities for fire protection, police protection, EMS, stormwater management, and solid waste management. 
(b)  Terms and Conditions Statement The terms and conditions statement shall incorporate by reference or include, but not be limited to: 
(i)  Conditions related to approval of the application for the MPO zoning district classification; 
(ii)  The MPO master plan, including any density/intensity standards, dimensional standards, and development standards established in the MPO master plan; 
(iii)  Conditions related to the approval of the MPO master plan, including any conditions related to the form and design of development shown in the MPO master plan; 
(iv)  Provisions addressing how transportation, potable water, wastewater, stormwater management, and other public facilities will be provided to accommodate the proposed development; 
(v)  Provisions related to environmental protection and monitoring; and 
(vi)  Any other provisions the City Council determines are relevant and necessary to the development of the MPO in accordance with applicable standards and regulations. 
(c)  Consistency with City Plans The MPO zoning district designation, the MPO master plan, and the terms and conditions statement shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan and any applicable small area plans adopted by the city. 
(d)  Minimum District Size The MPO Overlay district shall be at least two acres in size. 
(e)  Compatibility with Surrounding Areas Development along the perimeter of a MPO district shall be compatible with adjacent existing or proposed development. Where there are issues of compatibility, the MPO master plan shall provide for transition areas at the edges of the MPO district that provide for appropriate buffering and/or ensure a complementary character of uses. Determination of complementary character shall be based on densities/intensities, lot size and dimensions, building height, building mass and scale, hours of operation, exterior lighting, and siting of service areas. 
(f)  Development Phasing Plan If development in the MPO district is proposed to be phased, the MPO master plan shall include a development phasing plan that identifies the general sequence or phases in which the district is proposed to be developed, including how residential and nonresidential development will be timed, how infrastructure (public and private) and open space will be provided and timed, and how development will be coordinated with the city's capital improvements program. 
(g)  Conversion Schedule The MPO master plan may include a conversion schedule that identifies the extent to which one type of residential use may be converted to another type of residential use and one type of nonresidential use may be converted to another type of nonresidential use (i.e., residential to residential, or nonresidential to nonresidential). These conversions may occur within development areas and between development areas, as long as they occur within the same development phase, as identified by the approved development phasing plan, and are consistent with established extents of conversion set down in the conversion schedule. 
(h)  On-Site Public Facilities   
(i)  Design and Construction The MPO master plan shall establish the responsibility of the developer/landowner to design and construct or install required and proposed on-site public facilities in compliance with applicable city, state, and federal regulations. 
(ii)  Dedication The MPO master plan shall establish the responsibility of the developer/landowner to dedicate to the public the rights-of-way and easements necessary for the construction or installation of required and proposed on-site public facilities in compliance with applicable city, state, and federal regulations. 
(iii)  Modifications to Street Standards In approving a MPO master plan, the City Council may approve modifications or reductions of city street design standardsincluding those for right-of-way widths, pavement widths, required materials, and turning radiion finding that: 
a.  The MPO master plan provides for separation of vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic; 
b.  Access for emergency service vehicles is not substantially impaired; 
c.  Adequate off-street parking is provided for the uses proposed; and 
d.  Adequate space for public utilities is provided within the street right-of-way. 
(i)  Allowable Uses The range of allowable uses within a MPO district shall be the same range of uses allowed within the NAC district as identified in Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table. The MPO master plan shall provide additional detail about how impacts from uses not allowed within the base zoning district will be addressed by the MPO district. All applicable use-specific standards shall continue to apply within the MPO district. 
(j)  Densities/Intensities The densities for residential development and the intensities for nonresidential development applicable in each development area of a MPO district shall be as established in the MPO master plan, and shall be consistent with city plans. 
(k)  Dimensional Standards The dimensional standards applicable in each development area of a MPO district shall be as established in the MPO master plan. The MPO Master Plan shall include at least the following types of dimensional standards: 
(i)  Minimum lot area; 
(ii)  Minimum lot width; 
(iii)  Minimum and maximum setbacks; 
(iv)  Maximum lot coverage; 
(v)  Maximum building height; 
(vi)  Maximum individual building size; 
(vii)  Floor area ratio; and 
(viii)  Minimum setbacks from adjoining residential development or residential zoning districts. 
(l)  Development Standards All development in a MPO district shall comply with the development standards of Article 40.1-5: Development Standards, or any modifications of those standards shall be established in the MPO Master Plan, and shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan and the intent of MPO district. 
(m)  Amendments to an Approved MPO Master Plan   
(i)  General If an applicant determines it is necessary to alter the concept or intent of the master plan or terms and conditions, the master plan or terms and conditions shall be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards for its original approval. 
(ii)  Amendments Defined The following items are considered an alteration of the concept or intent of the master plan and are treated as an amendment: 
a.  Changes in use designations; 
b.  Density/intensity increases; 
c.  Decreases in open space; 
d.  Substantial changes in the location of streets (particularly if streets are to be deleted or access points to the development moved so traffic flows both inside and outside the development are affected); 
e.  Change in the location of any public easement; 
f.  Change in the proportion of housing types by more than 10 percent; 
g.  Substantial changes to the design or materials of structures; or 
h.  Violation of any specific condition of the master plan or terms and conditions. 
(n)  Minor Deviations Subsequent plans and permits for development within an approved MPO district may include minor deviations from the master plan or terms and conditions, provided such deviations are limited to changes addressing technical considerations that could not reasonably be anticipated during the zoning classification process or any other change that has no material effect on the character of the approved activity center district or any of its requirements. The following shall constitute minor deviations: 
(i)  Driveway locations; 
(ii)  Structure floor plan revisions; 
(iii)  Minor shifts in building size or location; and 
(iv)  Facility design modifications for amenities and the like. 
Changes that materially affect the basic concept of the master plan or basic parameters set by the terms and conditions are not considered minor deviations, and shall only be changed as amendments to the MPO district. 
(C)  Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District   
(1)  Purpose The Neighborhood Conservation Overlay (NCO) District is established and intended to protect and preserve the unique design features and character of established neighborhoods throughout the city, and to promote new construction that is compatible with the existing neighborhood character. The NCO district is a flexible tool that may be applied to multiple neighborhoods, each of which will have its own unique architectural, natural, cultural, and historic attributes. 
(2)  Establishment of Individual Neighborhood Conservation Districts The City Council may establish individual Neighborhood Conservation Overlay Districts in accordance with this section and Section 40.1-2.3(A), Zoning Map Amendment (Rezoning) or Text Amendment, after approving an area plan for the neighborhood specifying the development context in the district. Each district shall comply with the standards in Section 40.1-3.7(C)(4) General Development Standards for All NCO Districts. In establishing a new NCO District, the City Council may also establish a unique set of development standards applicable to all development in the particular district (see Section 40.1-3.7(C)(5), District-Specific Development Standards). 
(3)  Minimum Standards for Designation of an NCO District The City Council may approve an application for designation of a NCO District only if: 
(a)  At least 65 percent of the land area within the proposed NCO district, not including street and other rights-of-way, is developed; 
(b)  Development patterns in the district demonstrate an on-going effort to maintain or rehabilitate the character and physical features of existing buildings in the district; 
(c)  There is existing or potential pressure for new development or redevelopment and new infill development within the district; 
(d)  The area must possess one or more of the following distinctive features that create a cohesive identifiable setting, character or association: 
(i)  Scale, size, type of construction, or distinctive building materials; 
(ii)  Lot layouts, setbacks, street layouts, alleys or sidewalks; 
(iii)  Special natural or streetscape characteristics, such as creek beds, parks, gardens or street landscaping; 
(iv)  Land use patterns, including mixed or unique uses or activities; or 
(v)  Abuts or links designated historic districts and/or landmarks. 
(e)  The development standards proposed to be applied to the district will encourage the retention of the general character and appearance of existing development in the district. 
(4)  General Development Standards for All NCO Districts   
(a)  Compliance with Underlying Zoning District Standards These standards supplement the applicable development and district-specific standards found in the underlying base zoning district and do not affect the use regulations applicable in the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  Compliance with Approved Design and Development Standards No permit for any new construction or expansion of an existing structure resulting in an increase in building footprint area of 25 percent or more may be issued until the Planning Director determines that the proposal complies with all design standards established for the NCO district where the land is located. All new development in a NCO district shall comply with the development standards for the underlying zoning district. 
(c)  Conflict with Other Standards In the case of conflict between the NCO district standards and any other standards of this Ordinance, the NCO district development standards shall control. 
(5)  District-Specific Development Standards Each area designated as a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District shall identify, with specificity, the design standards to be applied to all new construction and expansion of existing structures. Aspects of development that these design standards may include, but are not be limited to, the following: 
(a)  Lot size; 
(b)  Location of proposed buildings or additions; 
(c)  Setbacks or required yards; 
(d)  Building height; 
(e)  Building size (for principal and accessory structures); 
(f)  Building orientation; 
(g)  Exterior building materials and colors; 
(h)  Building roof line and pitch; 
(i)  Building foundation treatment; 
(j)  Landscaping and screening; 
(k)  Impervious surface coverage; 
(l)  Paving requirements or limitations; 
(m)  Exterior lighting; 
(n)  Required features on a front façade; 
(o)  Neighborhood character and compatibility; 
(p)  Views of or from specific locations; 
(q)  Riparian areas, wetland areas, or drainage patterns; and 
(r)  Demolition of structures. 
The City Council may approve additional design standards addressing aspects of development not listed above. The City Council may also prohibit use types within a NCO district.

ARTICLE 40.1-4: - USE STANDARDS 
 
40.1-4.1 - Use Table 
(A)  Explanation of Use Table Structure   
(1)  General Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table, lists land uses and indicates whether they are allowed by right or with a use permit in a base zoning district, allowed in an activity center zoning district, or prohibited in a base zoning district and activity center zoning district. The use table also includes references to any additional requirements or regulations applicable to the specific use type. 
(2)  Organization of Uses The use table organizes allowable uses by use classifications, use categories, and use types. The use table and Section 40.1-4.2, Use Classifications, Categories, and Use Types, together provide a systematic basis for identifying and consolidating or distinguishing unidentified land uses to determine whether a particular land use is allowable in a particular zoning district and in addressing future land uses. 
(a)  Use Classifications The use classifications identify broad general classifications of land use and include residential uses, public and institutional uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Use classifications are further broken down into a series of general "use categories" and specific "use types." 
(b)  Use Categories The use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications, and are based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. For example, the Residential Use Classification is divided into the Household Living and Group Living use categories. Use categories are further broken down into a series of individual use types. 
(c)  Use Types The specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the specific principal uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. For example, Live/Work Dwellings, Single-Family Detached Dwellings, Two-to-Four Family Dwellings, Townhouse Dwellings, and Multi-Family Dwellings are use types in the Household Living Use Category. 
(3)  Permitted Uses A "P" in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed by right in the corresponding base zoning district, subject to compliance with any use-specific standards referenced in the final column of the use table. An "A" is used in the columns for the activity center districts, and specifies the allowable use types in a particular activity center district provided the use type is set out in an approved activity center master plan. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including those set forth in Article 40.1-5: Development Standards. 
(4)  Uses Allowed Only with a Use Permit A "U" in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed in the corresponding base zoning district only upon approval of a use permit in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3(B), Use Permit, and any use-specific standards referenced in the final column of the use table. Uses subject to a use permit are subject to all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including those set forth in Article 40.1-5: Development Standards. 
(5)  Allowed Uses Subject to a Activity Center District Classification An "A" in a cell indicates that a use category or use type is allowed by right in an activity center district, subject to compliance with the use-specific regulations set forth in the final column of the table and provided the use is set out as a possible use type in an approved activity center master plan. Allowed uses are subject to other applicable regulations in this Ordinance, including those set forth in Section 40.1-3.5, Activity Center Zoning Districts. Use types that are blank are not allowable in a particular activity center district, and shall not be included in a master plan. 
(6)  Prohibited Uses A blank cell or a slash in the use table indicates that the use type is prohibited in the corresponding zoning district. 
(7)  Use-Specific Standards When a particular use category or use type is permitted in a zoning district, there may be additional regulations that are applicable to a specific use. The existence of these use-specific standards is noted through a section reference in the last column of the use table titled "Additional Requirements." References refer to Section 40.1-4.3, Use-Specific Standards. These standards shall apply to a particular use regardless of the base zoning district where it is proposed unless otherwise specified. 
(8)  Use Restricted or Prohibited by Overlay Zoning District Regardless of whether the use table identifies a particular use type as a permitted use, allowed use, or use requiring a use permit in a zoning district, or references additional requirements for the use type, the use type may be restricted or prohibited, or subject to more restrictive additional requirements, in accordance with applicable overlay district provisions in Section 40.1-3.5, Overlay Zoning Districts. 
(9)  Unlisted Uses The Planning Director shall determine whether or not an unlisted use is part of an existing use category or use type defined in Section 40.1-4.2, Use Classifications, Categories, and Types, or is substantially similar to an already defined use type, using the standards in Section 40.1-4.2(A)(4), Interpretation of Unlisted Uses. 
(10)  Uses in the Downtown D1 and D2 Districts The use standards related to the Downtown D1 and D2 districts are included with the district-specific standards for each district in Appendix A and B, respectively, of this Ordinance. 
(11)  Uses in the Residential Mobile Home (RMH) District The RMH district is included as Appendix C of this Ordinance, and the range of allowable uses shall be limited to mobile or manufactured homes and existing supporting accessory uses.

(Ord. No. 2016-70, Amd. 1, 9-27-2016; Ord. No. 2014-103 , § 1(Exh. A, Amd. 2), 12-9-2014; Ord. No. 2015-83 , § 1(Exh. A, Amd. 4), 12-8-2015)  
40.1-4.2 - Use Classifications, Use Categories, and Use Types 
(A)  General   
(1)  Purpose This section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying, describing, categorizing, and consolidating or distinguishing land uses in a way that makes it easier to determine how a particular land use activity, or combination of activities, is to be considered in applying the use table and other provisions in this Ordinance. This section is also intended to provide support in identifying instances where a new or unanticipated land use not identified in the use table is of such a nature, function, or duration that the impact of allowing it in a particular zoning district is so similar to that of a use type already identified in the use table as allowed in the zoning district that allowing the new or unanticipated land use should be interpreted as being consistent with the intent of the zoning district and the use regulations. 
(2)  Structure of this Section   
(a)  General This section identifies each of the four use classifications in Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table, and includes a section under each use classification identifying each use category. There are "characteristics" and "examples" subsections under each use category (individual use types are defined in Article 40.1-8: Definitions). 
(b)  Principal Use Characteristics and Accessory Uses The "characteristics" subsection describes common characteristics of each use category. Principal uses are assigned to the use category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. Also listed are examples of common accessory uses that, unless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, are allowed in conjunction with a principal use. 
(c)  Examples The "examples" subsection lists common examples of use types included in the respective use category. The names of these example uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale sales," but sells mostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category rather than the Wholesale Sales Use Category. This is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of the Retail Sales and Service Use Category. 
(3)  Developments with Multiple Principal Uses When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category because all of the development's principal uses are in that use category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable use category and each use is subject to applicable regulations for that use category. Developments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district. 
(4)  Interpretation of Unlisted Uses   
(a)  Procedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted The Zoning Administrator may interpret a particular land use not expressly listed in the use table as allowed in a particular zoning district, in accordance with the procedure in Section 40.1-2.3(J), Interpretation, and based on the standards in Section 40.1-4.2(A)(4)(b), Standards for Approving Unlisted Uses. 
(b)  Standards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted The Zoning Administrator shall interpret an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district only after determining that the nature, function, and duration of the use and the impact of allowing it in the zoning district are so similar to those of a use type or use category allowable in the zoning district that the unlisted land use should be deemed allowable in the same manner as the similar use type or use category. In making such determination, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the purpose and intent statements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning district, the character of use types allowable in the district, and all relevant characteristics of the unlisted use, including but not limited to the following: 
(i)  The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, etc.; 
(ii)  The size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises; 
(iii)  Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution; 
(iv)  Any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing; 
(v)  The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise, whether enclosed, open, inside or outside the principal building; 
(vi)  Predominant types of items stored (such as business vehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and raw materials including liquids and powders); 
(vii)  The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures; 
(viii)  The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business hours and employment shifts; 
(ix)  Transportation requirements, including the modal split for people and freight, by volume type and characteristic of traffic generation to and from the site; 
(x)  Trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use types on the site; 
(xi)  Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit area or activity; 
(xii)  The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes; 
(xiii)  Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not limited to water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and 
(xiv)  The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type, which should not be greater than that of other use types allowed in the zoning district. 
(c)  Effect of Approval of Unlisted Use   
(i)  After interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or to recur frequently, or whether its omission from the use table is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. On determining that the unlisted use is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if unlisted, the Zoning Administrator shall initiate an application for a text amendment to this Ordinance to list the use in the use table. Until final action is taken on the text amendment application, the Zoning Administrator's interpretation shall be binding. 
(ii)  If after interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the Zoning Administrator determines that the unlisted use is of an unusual or transitory nature, and unlikely to recur frequently, the interpretation shall be binding in accordance with Section 40.1-4.4.2(A)(4), Interpretation of Unlisted Uses, without further action or amendment of this Ordinance. 
(iii)  Appeals of the Zoning Administrator's decision shall be submitted in accordance with the standards in Section 40.1-2.3(K), Appeal.

(5)  Uses with Variable Parking Demand Characteristics Uses that reference this subsection in Table 40.1-5.1(E)(2), Off-Street Parking Standards, have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it difficult to establish a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to this subsection, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking standards on the basis of a parking and loading demand study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Zoning Administrator, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
(6)  Unlisted Uses Upon receiving a development application for a use not expressly listed in this section, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to apply the off-street parking standard in the listed use that is deemed most similar to the use, or establish the off-street parking requirements by reference to standard parking resources published by the National Parking Association or the American Planning Association. Alternatively, the Planning Director may require the applicant to submit a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand based on the recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.

	OPTION 1: MINIMUM WIDTH 20 FEET 	OPTION 2: MINIMUM WIDTH 10 FEET [4] 
TYPE ABASIC 
This perimeter buffer functions as basic edge demarcating individual properties with a slight visual obstruction from the ground to a height of ten feet. 
 
2 ACI of canopy trees + 10 ACI of understory trees + 15 shrubs per 100 linear feet 
TYPE BAESTHETIC 
This perimeter buffer functions as an intermittent visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet, and creates the impression of spatial separation without eliminating visual contact between uses. 
 
8 ACI of canopy trees + 10 ACI of understory trees + 15 shrubs per 100 linear feet 	2 ACI of canopy trees +14 ACI understory trees + 35 shrubs per 100 linear feet 
TYPE CSEMI-OPAQUE 
This perimeter buffer functions as a semi-opaque screen from the ground to at least a height of six feet. 
 
12 ACI of canopy trees + 14 ACI of understory trees + 25 shrubs per 100 linear feet 	One 4-foot-high berm or one 4-foot-high solid fence + 2 ACI of canopy trees + 16 ACI understory trees per 100 linear feet 
TYPE DOPAQUE 
This perimeter buffer functions as an opaque screen from the ground to a height of at least six feet. This type of buffer prevents visual contact between uses and creates a strong impression of total separation. 
 
18 ACI of canopy trees + 20 ACI of understory trees + 55 shrubs per 100 linear feet 	One 6-foot-high solid fence + 12 ACI of canopy trees per 100 linear feet

[1] Letters in cells correspond to the buffer types depicted in Table 40.1-5.2(E)(3), Buffer Types. 
[2] Development in AC districts is subject to perimeter buffer requirements in the AC district standards. In cases where development is proposed next to an existing PD district having no perimeter buffer, the proposed development shall provide a perimeter buffer that is consistent with the type of buffer required if the adjacent use was in a differing base district appropriate for the type of use. 
[3] Multi-family, townhouse, multi-building campus, or shopping center developments shall provide buffers around the perimeter of the development instead of around individual buildings. 
 
(5)  Location of Buffers   
(a)  Perimeter buffers required by this section shall be located only along the outer perimeter of the parcel where it abuts another parcel, and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-of-way line. 
(b)  Perimeter buffers are not required along lot lines abutting streets, except as needed to screen outdoor industrial operations or storage on lots in an industrial district. Industrial uses with outdoor operations or storage components shall include perimeter buffers as necessary to screen outdoor use areas from off-site views. 
(c)  A perimeter buffer may be located along shared access easements between parcels in nonresidential developments. 
(6)  Responsibility for Buffer Installation Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing use and a perimeter buffer is required in accordance with this section, the developing parcel shall provide the full perimeter buffer required adjacent to the existing use in accordance with Table 40.1-5.2(E)(3) Buffer Types, and Table 40.1-5.2(E)(4), Buffer Type Application, unless a portion or all of a perimeter buffer that complies with the standards of this section already exists between the lots. Where all or part of a perimeter buffer exists, but the buffer does not fully comply with the standards of this section, the developing parcel shall be responsible for providing all the additional planting material necessary to meet the standards of this section. 
(7)  Development within Required Buffers   
(a)  The required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features (except fences or walls) that do not function to meet the standards of this section or that require removal of existing vegetation, unless otherwise permitted in this Ordinance. 
(b)  Sidewalks, trails, and other elements associated with passive recreation may be placed in perimeter buffers if all required landscaping is provided and damage to existing vegetation is minimized to the maximum extent practicable. 
(c)  Overhead and underground utilities required or allowed by the city are permitted to cross a required buffer in a perpendicular fashion, but shall minimize the impact to vegetation to the maximum extent practicable. Where required landscaping material is damaged or removed due to utility activity within a required buffer, the landowner shall be responsible for replanting all damaged or removed vegetation necessary to ensure the buffer meets the standards in this Ordinance. 
(8)  Sight Triangles No fencing, berms, walls, or other landscaping features may exceed 36 inches above grade within required sight triangles for streets, alleys, or driveways(See Section 4.1-8.2(C)(4). 
(9)  Credit for Existing Vegetation Existing vegetation meeting the size standards of Section 40.1-5.2(C)(2), Planting Standards, located within the perimeter buffer area may be preserved and credited toward the perimeter buffer standards. 
(F)  Screening   
 
(1)  General Requirements In addition to the other forms of required landscaping, screening shall be required to conceal specific areas of high visual or auditory impact or hazardous areas from off-site views. Such areas shall be screened at all times, unless otherwise specified, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or other proximate landscaping material. 
(2)  Items to be Screened The following areas shall be screened in accordance with this section: 
(a)  Large waste receptacles (e.g., dumpsters and cardboard recycling containers) and refuse collection areas; 
(b)  Loading and service areas; 
(c)  Outdoor storage areas (including, but not limited to: inoperable vehicles, appliances, tires, manufactured homes, building materials, equipment, raw materials, and above-ground storage tanks) located within 600 feet of a public right-of-way; 
(d)  Ground-level mechanical equipment and utility meters; and 
(e)  New construction, demolition, or other site conditions that could be unsafe for pedestrian or vehicles. 
(3)  Screening Methods The following items are permitted for use as screening materials, and more than one method may be used on a lot or site. 
(a)  Vegetative materials that provide a fully opaque screen to the minimum height necessary to fully screen the facility from off-site views; or 
(b)  An opaque fence or wall consistent with the standards in Section 40.1-5.10, Fences and Walls. 
Alternative screening materials that are not listed or alternative configurations may be proposed as part of an alternative landscaping plan (see Section 40.1-5.2(H)), if the alternative materials or configuration provide an equivalent or superior screening function. 
(4)  Configuration of Vegetative Materials In cases where vegetative materials are used for screening in accordance with this subsection, the vegetative materials shall:

(e)  Drainage Eating establishments and other uses that produce significant amounts of liquid waste shall configure areas intended for large waste receptacles and refuse collection to drain to the sanitary sewer system through grease traps or similar devices as required by the Planning Director. 
(G)  Site Landscaping   
(1)  Purpose and Intent Site landscaping material is intended to soften the visual impact of building foundations and provide for the even dispersal of trees across a development site. 
(2)  Distinguished from Other Required Landscaping Site landscaping, for the purpose of this section, is landscaping that is not: 
(a)  Required vehicular use area landscaping; 
(b)  Located within a required perimeter buffer strip; or 
(c)  Required screening. 
(3)  Site Landscaping Standards Except for Single-Family Detached and Two-to Four-Family Dwellings, site landscaping shall be required for all development, and shall be supplied in the amounts identified in Table 40.1-5.2(G)(3), Required Site Landscaping Plantings.

NOTES: 
[1] See Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table. 
[2] At least one-half of the required shrubs shall be of an evergreen variety. 
[3] Each evergreen tree meeting the minimum size standards of this section shall count as two caliper inches towards the total number of required canopy tree caliper inches. 
 
(4)  Shrub Placement Required shrubs shall be placed around the building perimeter, a minimum of three feet from the building, with emphasis placed on building foundations visible from the public right-of-way. Required shrubs may be planted up to 15 feet from the building provided there is a sidewalk located between the planting area and the building wall. 
(5)  Tree Placement Trees serving as site landscaping shall be dispersed across a site in accordance with good planting practice and the following priority listing: 
(a)  In yards between a building façade and a street right-of-way where no vehicular use area landscaping is required; 
(b)  Between a building and an adjacent lot with an existing use that provides more than 50 percent of the vegetative material associated with a required perimeter buffer; 
(c)  Between a building façade and an abutting lot with the same or a more intense zoning district classification (where no perimeter buffering is required); 
(d)  Within open-space set-aside areas with no existing or reforested trees; 
(e)  Adjacent to on-site areas of pedestrian or vehicular circulation where no other vegetative material is required (e.g., drive-throughs or stacking lanes); or 
(f)  Other areas near accessory structures or accessory uses. 
 
(H)  Alternative Landscape Plan   
(1)  Purpose In cases where development conditions require a deviation from the landscaping standards in this section, or the tree protection standards in Section 40.1-5.3, Tree Protection, an alternative landscaping plan shall be required. An alternative landscaping plan shall indicate how compliance with the standards in this Ordinance is impossible or impractical, and shall illustrate how compliance can be achieved to the maximum extent practicable. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a development configuration that meets or exceeds the landscaping and tree protection standards in this Ordinance. 
(2)  Justification Alternative plans, materials, or methods may be justified due to: 
(a)  Natural conditions, such as streams, natural rock formations, or topography; 
(b)  The likelihood that landscaping material would be ineffective at maturity due to topography, placement, or other existing site conditions; 
(c)  Lot size or configuration; 
(d)  The presence of utility or other easements; 
(e)  The potential for interference with public safety; and 
(f)  Other situations where strict adherence to the landscaping or tree protection standards in this Ordinance are determined to be impractical by the Director of Planning and Development Services. 
(3)  Allowable Deviations With input from other city departments, the Planning Director shall approve an alternative landscape plan if it meets the purpose and intent of the landscaping standards in Section 40.1-5.2, Landscaping and Screening, or Section 40.1-5.3, Tree Protection, as appropriate. Allowable deviations from the standards of this section include, but are not limited to the following: 
(a)  Reduced Planting Rates due to Public Facilities An adjustment to planting locations or reduction of up to 20 percent in the type or total number of required caliper inches may be allowed when underground connections to public facilities or public utilities, or public easements or right-of-way, are located upon or in close proximity to the parcel. 
(b)  Reduction in Standards due to Nature of Parcel A reduction in the count, spacing, or species diversity standards by up to 20 percent may be allowed where the reduction is desirable in terms of protection of existing natural resources, better consistency with the goals of the comprehensive plan, or a site design that exceeds the quality of what would otherwise result under a strict application of the standards in this Ordinance, in the opinion of the Planning Director. 
(c)  Redevelopment of Nonconforming Sites The installation of required landscaping during redevelopment of existing nonconforming sites shall occur in accordance with Section 40.1-6.6, Nonconforming Site Aspects. 
(I)  Other Landscape Standards   
(1)  Time for Installation of Required Landscaping   
(a)  Time Limit All required landscaping (including mulching and seeding) shall be installed in accordance with the required planting standards set forth in this section prior to issuance of a permanent or non-temporary certificate of occupancy unless the Planning Director grants an extension to this time limit in accordance with Section 40.1-5.2(I)(1)(b), Extensions. 
(b)  Extensions   
(i)  The Planning Director may, for good cause shown, grant extensions to the above time limit, allowing a developer/owner to delay the installation of required landscaping. Circumstances that may warrant an extension include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Unusual environmental conditions, such as drought, ice, hurricanes, or over-saturated soil (deep mud); 
b.  It is not yet the appropriate planting season for the approved plant species; or 
c.  Credible evidence that the approved plant species or required plant sizes are not commercially available and cannot be substituted within a reasonable time despite an applicant's diligent effort to secure the required materials. 
(ii)  Upon receipt of a performance guarantee, the city may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a maximum period of up to 180 days. 
(2)  Maintenance of Landscaping Materials The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscape areas not in the public right-of-way. Such areas shall be maintained in accordance with the approved landscape plan or alternative landscape plan and shall present a healthy and orderly appearance free from refuse and debris. All plant life shown on an approved landscape plan or alternative landscape plan shall be replaced if it dies, is seriously damaged, or removed. 
(a)  Damage Due to Natural Occurrence In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to meet the standards of this section is severely damaged due to an unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, or other natural occurrence such as damage by wild or domestic animals, the owner or developer may be required to replant if the landscaping standards are not being met. The owner shall have one growing season to replace or replant. The Planning Director shall consider the type and location of the landscape buffer or required vegetation area as well as the propensity for natural re-vegetation in making a determination on the extent of replanting requirements. 
(b)  Protection during Operations The owner or developer shall take actions to protect trees and landscaping from unnecessary damage during all facility and site maintenance operations. Plants shall be maintained in a way that does not obstruct sight distances at roadway and drive intersections, obstruct traffic signs or devices, or interfere with the use of sidewalks or pedestrian trails. 
(c)  Maintain Shape All required trees (whether canopy, understory, or otherwise) shall be maintained in their characteristic natural shape, and shall not be severely pruned, sheared, topped, or shaped as shrubs. Trees (including but not limited to Crape Myrtles) that have been severely pruned, sheared, topped, or shaped as shrubs no longer serve the intended buffering or screening function and shall be considered as damaged vegetation in need of replacement in accordance with Section 40.1-5.2(I)(2)(a), Damage Due to Natural Occurrence, and shall be replaced within one growing season. 
(d)  Natural Death The natural death of existing vegetation within any required landscape area does not necessarily constitute a violation and does not require re-vegetation to replace the plant material unless the required landscape area no longer complies with the required standards of this section. In no instance shall this provision be construed to prevent re-planting if, in the opinion of the Planning Director, the required performance standard of the landscaping is not being met.

40.1-5.11 - Signage 
(A)  Purpose and Findings The purpose of these sign standards is to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city, to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety, to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property, and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. 
(1)  Findings The City Council finds: 
(a)  Signs provide a vital function for the convenience of the public and for the efficient communication of commercial and noncommercial speech. 
(b)  Unlike oral speech, signs may cause harm by virtue of the physical space they occupy by obstructing views, distracting motorists, displacing alternative uses of land, and endangering the safety of persons or property. The city has a substantial and compelling interest in all of the purposes set forth below and has a substantial and compelling interest in regulating signs in such a way that the harms caused by signs might be reduced and mitigated. 
(c)  Signs are essential to the health and economic well-being of the city by: 
(i)  Facilitating consumer transactions and other commercial and industrial activities that allow businesses to be successful, which in turn provides employment and supports a stable tax base; and 
(ii)  Providing information and directions for the safe and efficient travel of motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. 
(d)  Signs have a strong visual impact on the character and aesthetic appearance of the city. 
(i)  They are a prominent part of the cityscape and, as such, can enhance or detract from the city's image and character and facilitate or impede the creation of an attractive and harmonious environment in the city. 
(ii)  Their suitability or appropriateness helps to define the way in which the city and neighborhoods within the city are perceived. 
(e)  The visual environment and character of the city are important factors in the city's economic well-being because they influence Portsmouth's appearance and land values. 
(f)  The visual environment and character of the city, as well as the orderly flow of traffic and safety of travel, are diminished when visual clutter results and the vision of motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians is obstructed by the unrestricted proliferation and placement of signs, or from the improper maintenance of signs. 
(g)  Regulation of the size, height, number, and spacing of signs throughout the city is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, to provide ample, meaningful opportunities for persons who desire to display information by means of a sign to have their information seen and understood, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising and other messages for the benefit of all persons in the city. 
(h)  For these reasons, the needs of individual citizens, property owners, and businesses to convey their commercial and noncommercial messages must be balanced against the goals of the city to ensure the safety of its roads and pedestrian-ways, maintain its desired character, and preserve and enhance the property values of property owners and businesses. The provisions of this Sec. 40.1-5.11 do not entirely eliminate all of the harm that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Instead, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harm caused by signs. 
(i)  The provisions of this Sec. 40.1-5.11 do not apply to every form and instance of visual speech that may be displayed within the city. They are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth below. 
(j)  The provisions of this Sec. 40.1-5.11 are neither intended nor designed to restrict or control signs for the purpose of promoting or stifling any messages and content that might appear on them. 
(2)  Purpose The purpose of this Sec. 40.1-5.11 is to: 
(a)  Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare of those within the city; 
(b)  Promote the efficient use of signs as a means of communication; 
(c)  Ensure that the right to free speech is protected; 
(d)  Maintain and enhance a visual environment that allows the city to attract sources of economic development and supports the economic well-being of the city's businesses; 
(e)  Protect and enhance the character, quality, and viability of the city's development and neighborhoods; 
(f)  Protect scenic views and avoid sign clutter; 
(g)  Reduce the distractions, obstructions, and hazards to pedestrian, bicycle, and automobile traffic caused by the excessive number, size, height, illumination, movement, indiscriminate placement, overconcentration, or unsafe construction or maintenance of signs; 
(h)  Reasonably accommodate: 
(i)  The identification and advertising needs of businesses, institutions, and other entities; and 
(ii)  The needs of persons moving through the public spaces of the city to identify and locate destinations and find desired products and services; 
(i)  Ensure signs are compatible with their surroundings, and minimize potential adverse effects on nearby properties; 
(j)  Enhance property values and business opportunities; and 
(k)  Enable efficient and consistent permitting and enforcement. 
(B)  Applicability   
(1)  General Unless exempted in accordance with subsection (2) below, any installation, erection, construction, alteration, or maintenance of a sign shall comply with the standards in this Sec. 40.1-5.11. Signs located in the D1 and D2 districts shall be permitted with a zoning compliance permit and shall be subject to the provisions of this Article, and either the Downtown Design Guidelines or the D2 Form Based Code, as applicable. The more restrictive regulations shall apply in cases of conflict. 
(2)  Exemptions Where not prohibited by subsection 40.1-5.11(D)(2), Prohibited Signs, the following signs are exempt from the standards in this Sec. 40.1-5.11:

(5)  Any other development proposal which, as determined by the City Engineer, has a significant potential to cause or aggravate traffic safety or congestion problems and, as such, would benefit from a professional review of proposed access and circulation designs. 
(B)  Transportation Analysis Standards and Requirements   
(1)  For any development described in subsection (a) above, a traffic impact analysis, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, shall be submitted for review and consideration by the city. 
(2)  A minimum of five copies of such traffic impact analysis shall be submitted to the city at the same time as the initial application for approval. Preliminary Subdivision Plats, Development Plans, Amendments to the Zoning Map, Use Permit applications, and other development proposals for which a traffic impact analysis is required shall not be deemed to be received until the traffic impact analysis is submitted. The traffic engineering department will provide available technical information. The applicant must collect traffic data that is not already available or is outdated. 
(3)  The submitted traffic impact analysis shall, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer in writing, contain the following information and analysis: 
(a)  Existing conditions summary including twenty-four-hour volumes, peak periods and peak volumes on adjacent roadways, peak periods and peak volumes of the generator, and peak hour factor(s); roadway geometrics; grades; lateral clearance; heavy vehicles, pedestrian, bicycle, and recreational vehicle percentages; existing lane configurations; traffic control devices and timing plans if signals are present and level of service analysis based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. 
(b)  Future conditions summary-including the horizon (analysis) year(s) and the criteria used in its selection, committed future roadway improvements, traffic growth factors combined with forecasts for adjacent sites to determine future background traffic (both twenty-four-hour and peak period), and level of service analysis, compared with existing conditions. 
(c)  Trip generation and design hour volumes-including traffic forecast for site development to include twenty-four-hour and peak hour volumes both for the traffic generator itself and on adjacent roadways. Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, Sixth Edition, or as it may from time to time be amended) rates or equations shall be used unless verifiable local data is available. Any assumptions or adjustments shall be fully documented and, where appropriate, justified with source references provided. 
(d)  Trip distribution and traffic assignment-including a directional distribution of site traffic to its area of influence based on primary market, analogy, origin-destination, gravity model, or other similar methods. Each step in the process shall be fully and carefully documented. 
(e)  Design year total volumes developed for both twenty-four-hour and for the peak periods of the generator and on adjacent roadways. 
(f)  Capacity analysis-including intersection and lane capacity based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual as it may from time to time be amended and revised. Where intersections (both signalized and unsignalized) are spaced in such proximity or the volumes are such that the intersection does not operate independently, appropriate progression and queuing analyses performed using a recognized methodology or analysis or simulation package must accompany the capacity analyses. Capacity analyses shall be prepared for each potential access design scenario. Any assumptions and adjustments to the default values in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual shall be fully documented and justified. These include, but are not limited to, peak hour factor, average running speeds, and cycle lengths, especially very short or long cycles. All worksheets shall be submitted. 
(g)  The distribution and frequency of traffic accidents shall be analyzed and a determination made as to whether any safety deficiencies exist or will be caused or exacerbated. This shall specifically include a safety analysis of all proposed street extensions. 
(h)  The recommended roadway and traffic network improvements based on the design hour in the design year shall be shown on a scaled plan sheet with appropriate narrative. Such improvements shall be designed to yield a minimum level of service of "C" as defined by the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual as it may from time to time be amended, supplemented, or revised. Where the existing conditions provide a current level of service of less than "C," the improvements shall be designed to at least maintain the current volume to capacity ratio as determined by the methods contained in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual without further degradation through the design year plus two years. A detailed construction cost estimate of the required improvements shall be provided. 
(i)  Including the number and width of driveway lanes, the appropriate throat lengths (both unobstructed and with cross traffic permitted) for ingress and egress points, stacking and queuing lanes, pedestrian accommodations, bicycle facilities, and any other facilities or accommodations and any other factor which could impact traffic operations along the adjacent roadways or overall traffic safety, both internal and external. The internal circulation system shall be designed to preclude stacking or queuing in the travel lanes of adjacent roadways during the peak hours of the traffic generator. 
(j)  Including all conclusions of the analyst applicable to the site, particularly with respect to the appropriate timing and phasing of improvements. Timing and phasing must be clearly tied to identifiable stages of development or specific time frames. Conclusions about the relative safety of the post-development situation shall also be included. 
(k)  An executive summary containing key findings and recommended actions. 
(4)  All intersections, commercial entrances, median breaks, pavement markings, driveways, or other roadway features potentially affecting traffic flow located within 500 feet of the proposed development as well as all intersections and driveways internal to the development shall be considered and either shown or clearly noted on a scaled plan submitted with the traffic impact analysis.  
40.1-5.13 - Underground Utilities 
All utilities within or serving new development (e.g., cable television, electrical (excluding transformers), gas, sewer, telephone, and water lines) shall be placed underground in accordance with Section 32-155 of the City Code.  
ARTICLE 40.1-6: - NONCONFORMITIES 
 
40.1-6.1 - General Applicability 
(A)  Purpose and Scope There exist in the city nonconforming uses of land, structures, lots, and signs that were lawfully established before this Ordinance was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to its requirements. The purpose and intent of this article is to regulate and to limit the continued existence of those nonconforming uses, structures, lots, and signs that do not conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, or any subsequent amendments. 
(B)  Intent of Provisions It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but discourage their survival or substantial investment in them except under the limited circumstances established in this article. 
(C)  Authority to Continue Nonconformities are allowed to continue, and are encouraged to receive routine maintenance in accordance with the requirements of this article as a means of preserving safety and appearance. 
(D)  Determination of Nonconformity Status In all cases, the burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the responsibility of the owner of the land on which the alleged nonconformity is located. 
(E)  Minor Repairs and Maintenance Minor repairs and normal maintenance that are required to keep nonconforming uses, structures, lots, and signs in a safe condition are allowed, provided the minor repair or maintenance does not extend, expand, or enlarge the nonconformity. For the purposes of this section, "minor repair or normal maintenance" shall mean: 
(1)  Maintenance of Safe Condition Repairs that are necessary to maintain a nonconforming use, structure, lot, or sign in a safe condition. 
(2)  Maintenance of Land for Safety Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and to promote the safety of surrounding uses. 
(3)  Maintenance Limitations An improvement or other action intended to materially extend the useful life of a nonconformity shall not be considered maintenance. 
(F)  Value of Development or Redevelopment The cost or cash value of development or redevelopment associated with a nonconformity shall be determined by the Building Official. 
(G)  Change of Tenancy or Ownership No change of title or possession or right to possession of land shall be construed to prevent the continuance of a nonconforming use, structure, lot, or sign.  
40.1-6.2 - Nonconforming Uses 
(A)  General Nonconforming uses are declared generally incompatible with the permitted uses in the zoning district in which they are located and with the provisions of this Ordinance. To be considered a nonconforming use the property owner must provide documentation to the Zoning Administrator that the use was legally established. Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the standards in this subsection. 
(B)  Change of Use   
(1)  Residential Uses   
(a)  Nonconforming residential uses located within a building on a lot in a business district may be changed to another nonconforming residential use. 
(b)  In the event a building on a lot in a business district containing a nonconforming residential use is redeveloped to an extent exceeding 50 percent of its reproducible value (exclusive of foundations), the nonconforming residential use shall be extinguished, and all uses shall comply with this Ordinance. 
(2)  All Other Uses   
(a)  A nonconforming use, other than a residential use shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use. 
(b)  Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(C)  Expansion and Enlargement   
(1)  Generally Except as otherwise allowed below, no nonconforming use shall be enlarged, intensified or increased, nor intensified to occupy a larger structure, building or land area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or subsequent amendment of this ordinance. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel unoccupied by such use at the time of the adoption or subsequent amendment of this ordinance, and no building or structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land. 
Nonconforming uses in a historic zoning district (HR, HLO, HLB) may expand, subject to an approved use permit, and the standards in this section. 
(2)  Date of Establishment Nonconforming uses in a historic district may only be expanded if lawfully-established prior to the following dates: 
(a)  Lots in the Olde Towne Historic District: September 23, 1971; 
(b)  Lots in the Truxtun Historic District: March 25, 1975; 
(c)  Lots in the Cradock Historic District: February 10, 1976; 
(d)  Lots in the Park View Historic District: April 1, 1984; and 
(e)  Lots in the Port Norfolk Historic District: April 26, 1983. 
(3)  Procedure   
(a)  Requests for expansion to an existing nonconforming use shall be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in Section 40.1-2.3(B), Use Permits, and Section 40.1-6.2(C)(3), Use Permit Standards. 
(b)  Expansions to nonconforming uses on lots within a Historic District shall obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness (Section 40.1-2.3(I)) prior to review of the Use Permit application. 
(4)  Use Permit Standards In approving a use permit for the expansion of a nonconforming use, the Planning Commission shall find: 
(a)  The nonconforming use remains compatible with adjacent land uses and the comprehensive plan; 
(b)  Approval of the use permit is not injurious to the neighborhood; 
(c)  All access roads and entrance or exit drives to the nonconformity will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control and access in the case of fire or other emergency; 
(d)  All off-street parking, loading, refuse collection, and other service areas will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and economic, noise, glare, odor, and other impacts on adjoining properties; 
(e)  All landscaping, screening, and fencing will be adequate, with respect to the effectiveness of the type, dimensions, and character, and will be adequate with respect to minimizing the economic, noise, glare, odor, and other impacts of the nonconformity on adjoining properties and other properties in the neighborhood; 
(f)  That the type, size, and intensity of the proposed use, including such considerations as storage of items and arrangement, the size of the site and the location of the use upon it, and the hours of operation and numbers of people who are likely to utilize the use, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the impact of the nonconformity upon adjoining properties, other properties in the neighborhood, and achieving the purpose and intent of the zoning district in which the property is located; 
(g)  No part of the nonconforming use being expanded occurs outside a building or structure; 
(h)  Denial of the request would create a severe and undue hardship to the property owner; and 
(i)  Denial will result in no appreciable benefit to the neighborhood. 
(5)  Conditions The Planning Commission may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and the general public. 
(D)  Discontinuance or Abandonment   
(1)  A nonconforming use shall not be re-established after discontinuance for a period of two years or more. If efforts to renovate or repair the use legally began prior to the expiration of the two year period, the use is not considered a vacancy, abandonment, or discontinuance, provided all appropriate permits or development approvals are obtained, and provided the renovation or repair is completed within one year from commencement of repair or renovation, and the use is re-established within one month from the time the renovation or repairs are completed. Failure to complete the repairs or renovation within two years or re-establish the use within one month following repairs or renovation shall constitute discontinuance, and a nonconforming use shall not be re-established. 
(2)  If a building, structure or land was: a)vacant on May 1, 2010, b) the specialized equipment necessary for the operation of the approved use removed; and c) repairs are not occurring with a valid building permit, that parcel of land is to be considered vacant and all previous approvals null due to the owner's activities. 
(E)  Accessory Uses Once a nonconforming principal use is discontinued, all associated accessory uses shall cease operations within 30 days. 
(F)  Relocation In the event a structure housing a nonconforming use is moved any distance, the nonconforming use shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
(G)  Reconstruction after Casualty Damage   
(1)  Destruction or Damage by Act of God or Natural Disaster   
(a)  Any nonconforming use which has been damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster or other act of God, may be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced to eliminate or reduce the nonconforming features. 
(b)  A nonconforming use may be restored to its original nonconforming condition, regardless of the amount of damage or destruction, provided it complies with the flood protection standards in Chapter 14 of the City Code. 
(c)  The owner or the owner's contractor shall apply for a building permit and complete all reconstruction within two years of the act of God or natural disaster. 
(d)  In the event the damage or destruction occurs in a federally-declared disaster area, all reconstruction shall be completed within four years of the declaration date. 
(e)  If a nonconforming use is not reconstructed within the required timeframe, reconstruction shall occur only in compliance with the standards in this Ordinance. 
(2)  Destruction or Damage by Other Means Casualty damage resulting from a means other than an act of God or natural disaster shall be subject to the following standards. 
(a)  Destruction or Damage of 50 Percent of Value   
(i)  Except for single-family detached, attached, two-to four-family, and townhouse dwellings, in the event a structure housing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, to an extent that constitutes 50 percent or more of its replacement value (exclusive of foundations) at the time of damage or destruction, the use shall only be restored in a manner that conforms with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
(ii)  New construction (including the establishment of off-street parking, landscaping, signage, and other site features) shall be in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
(iii)  Nonconforming single-family detached, attached, two-to four-family, and townhouse dwellings damaged in excess of 50 percent of replacement value (exclusive of foundations) at the time of damage or destruction may be re-built subject to the standards in Section 40.1-6.2(G)(2)(b), Damage of Less Than 50 Percent of Value. 
(b)  Damage of Less Than 50 Percent of Value   
(i)  In the event a structure housing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, to an extent that constitutes less than 50 percent of its replacement value (exclusive of foundations) at the time of damage or destruction, it may be re-built to its previous form if a building permit for such repair or restoration is obtained within one year of the casualty damage, and repair or restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. 
(ii)  Wherever practical, redevelopment of a nonconforming use following casualty damage shall demonstrate greater compliance with this Ordinance than existed prior to the casualty. 
(iii)  In no event shall repair or restoration increase, expand, or enlarge the degree of nonconformity.  
40.1-6.3 - Nonconforming Structures 
(A)  Relationship with Nonconforming Uses A nonconforming principal structure containing a conforming use may only continue in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Nonconforming structures housing nonconforming uses may only continue in accordance with the standards in Section 40.1-6.2, Nonconforming Uses. 
(B)  Continuation Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continued use of nonconforming structures in accordance with Section 40.1-6.1(E), Minor Repairs and Maintenance. 
(C)  Enlargement   
(1)  Except for nonconforming structures in a historic district, nonconforming structures may be redeveloped or enlarged, provided they shall not be enlarged or expanded in any way that increases the nonconformity. Expansion of the structure in a way that complies with applicable dimensional standards or that decreases the degree of nonconformity is permitted. 
(2)  In the event a nonconforming structure is enlarged to an extent exceeding 50 percent of the structure's replacement value (exclusive of foundations), the entire structure shall be brought into compliance with the applicable dimensional standards for the district where located. 
(3)  In historic districts, a nonconforming structure may only be enlarged in accordance with the standards and procedure for enlarging a nonconforming use in Section 40-1.6.2 (C), Expansion and Enlargement in Historic Districts. 
(D)  Relocation A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless upon relocation it conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. 
(E)  Restoration after Casualty Damage   
(1)  Destruction or Damage by Act of God or Natural Disaster   
(a)  Any nonconforming structure which has been damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster or other act of God, may be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced to eliminate or reduce the nonconforming features. 
(b)  A nonconforming structure may be restored it to its original nonconforming condition, regardless of the amount of damage or destruction, provided it complies with the flood protection standards in Chapter 14 of the City Code. 
(c)  The owner or the owner's contractor shall apply for a building permit and complete all reconstruction within two years of the act of God or natural disaster.

(2)  Destruction or Damage by Other Means Casualty damage resulting from a means other than an act of God or natural disaster shall be subject to the following standards. 
(a)  Residential Development If a legally-established single-family attached, detached, two- to four-family, or townhouse dwelling is destroyed by casualty on a lot in a residential zoning district that was part of a subdivision or division of land evidenced by plat or deed, or both, recorded prior to April 25, 1961, an identical replacement use may be reconstructed even though the structure is nonconforming. 
(b)  Nonresidential Development   
(i)  Destruction or Damage of 50 Percent of Value   
a.  Except for single-family detached, attached, two-to four-family, and townhouse dwellings, in the event a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, to an extent that constitutes more than 50 percent of its replacement value (exclusive of foundations)at the time of damage or destruction, it shall only be restored in a manner that conforms with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
b.  New construction (including the establishment of off-street parking, landscaping, signage, and other site features) shall be in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
(ii)  Damage of Less Than 50 Percent of Value   
a.  In the event a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, to an extent that constitutes less than 50 percent of its replacement value (exclusive of foundations)at the time of damage or destruction, it may be re-built to its previous form if a building permit for such repair or restoration is obtained within one year of the casualty damage, and repair or restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. 
b.  In no event shall repair or restoration increase the nonconformity.  
40.1-6.4 - Nonconforming Lots 
(A)  Development Prohibited No use or structure shall be established on a lot of record that does not conform to the standards established in this Ordinance, except in accordance with this section. 
(B)  Status of Structures on Nonconforming Lots   
(1)  Conforming structures legally established on a nonconforming lot prior to May 1, 2010 may be continued, enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered in any way that is in conformance with the standards of this Ordinance. 
(2)  Nonconforming structures legally established on a nonconforming lot prior May 1, 2010 may be continued, enlarged, or redeveloped in accordance with the standards in Section 40.1-6.3, Nonconforming Structures. 
(C)  Governmental Acquisition of a Portion of Lot Conforming lots subject to governmental acquisition of a portion of the lot for a public purpose that results in the lot becoming nonconforming because it no longer complies with lot area or width standards of the district shall be deemed conforming upon receipt of a Zoning Compliance Permit (Section 40.1-2.3(F)), and compliance with the following standards: 
(1)  The development proposed complies with Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table. 
(2)  The development proposed complies with the dimensional standards of this Ordinance to the maximum extent practicable; 
(3)  The development proposed is designed to comply with the off-street parking and landscaping standards of this Ordinance to the maximum extent practicable; 
(4)  The development proposed complies with all other standards and requirements of this Ordinance; and 
(5)  The proposed development is designed and located in a way that is compatible with surrounding development. 
(D)  Lot Consolidation   
(1)  If a nonconforming lot of record has continuously been in separate ownership from any contiguous lot on the same existing or proposed public right-of-way since April 25, 1961, the nonconforming lot may be developed in accordance with the applicable standards in this Ordinance. 
(2)  If a nonconforming lot of record has, at any time since April 25, 1961, been in common ownership with any contiguous lot on the same existing or proposed public right-of-way, such lots shall be consolidated, with the following exceptions: 
(a)  Lots within a historic district; and 
(b)  Preexisting non-conforming lots occupied by a detached single family residence where the principal building, associated accessory building[s] and related site improvements cross interior lot lines shall be determined to be a single lot of record. Such interior lot lines may be vacated at the request of the property owner. However, no lot of record shall be resubdivided unless all new lots so created are in conformity with the lot requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located. 
(3)  If all the contiguous lots in common ownership are consolidated and the resulting lot remains nonconforming, it still may be developed in accordance with Section 40.1-6.4(E), Development of Nonconforming Lots. 
(E)  Development of Nonconforming Lots   
(1)  In Residential Districts   
(a)  Nonconforming lots within a residential district may be developed for single-family detached residential use in accordance with the requirements in Section 40.1-2.3(C), Type I Development Plan, if all of the contiguous nonconforming lots in common ownership are consolidated, or if consolidation cannot be achieved because lots are not under common ownership. 
(b)  If after consolidation, or if consolidation cannot be achieved, the lot(s) still fail to comply with the standards of this Ordinance, one single-family detached residential unit may be developed on the lot(s). The single-family detached residential unit shall be located on the lot and designed so as to comply with the standards of this Ordinance, to the maximum extent practicable. 
(2)  In All Other Districts Nonconforming lots in business and special districts may be developed in accordance with the requirements in Section 40.1-2.3(D) and the following standards: 
(a)  The use shall be permitted in the district where proposed (See Table 40.1-4.1(A), Use Table); 
(b)  The use shall be of a design and location on the lot that is compatible with adjacent, existing uses; and 
(c)  The use shall comply with the applicable district standards to the maximum extent practicable. 
(F)  Restoration after Casualty Damage If a legally-established, conforming use is destroyed by casualty on a nonconforming lot that was part of a subdivision or division of land evidenced by plat or deed, or both, recorded prior to April 25, 1961, an identical replacement use may be reconstructed even though the lot is nonconforming.  
40.1-6.5 - Nonconforming Signs 
The following additional restrictions shall apply to signs which were legally erected prior to January 9, 2018, but which do not conform to provisions of this Ordinance: 
(1)  Any nonconforming on-premises sign and sign structure shall be removed or brought into conformance with this Ordinance if for any period of at least two years it does not advertise a business or service located on the same lot with the sign; 
(2)  Any nonconforming off-premises sign and sign structure shall be removed or brought into conformance with this Ordinance if for any period of at least two years it does not contain copy or messages on the advertising display area; 
(3)  In accordance with Code of Virginia, Section 15.2-2307(G), the city may require the property owner to remove any non-conforming sign and/or sign structure which has been abandoned if the business for which the sign was erected has not been in operation for at least two years, or the city may remove the sign and structure after giving notice and reasonably attempting to contact the property owner and charge the cost of removal to the property owner; and 
(4)  If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed or replaced except in conformity with all of the provisions of this Ordinance. All remnants of the former sign or sign structure not incorporated into the repaired, reconstructed or replaced signage shall be removed from the property. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is "destroyed" if damaged to the extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former condition equals or exceeds the value of the sign so damaged.  
40.1-6.6 - Nonconforming Site Aspects 
(A)  Purpose   
(1)  The purpose of this section is to provide a means by which the city may require certain nonconforming site features to come into compliance with the standards of this Ordinance as part of remodeling or expansion of a building or structure. 
(2)  It is not the intent of this section to allow multiple incremental improvements to a nonconforming site without addressing the nonconformities as required in this section. 
(B)  Applicability   
(1)  For purposes of this section, the term "nonconforming site features" includes the following: 
(a)  Nonconforming off-street parking; 
(b)  Nonconforming landscaping; 
(c)  Nonconforming screening of mechanical equipment; and 
(d)  Nonconforming screening walls or fences. 
(2)  If an application is filed for a building permit for the remodeling or expansion of a building or site that has one or more nonconforming site features identified in Section 40.1-6.6(B), Applicability, and the value of the proposed improvements over a five-year period exceeds at least 25 percent of the assessed value of the existing site over a five-year period, the applicant shall be required to address the nonconforming site features as provided in this section. 
(3)  The Planning Director may develop administrative guidelines to assist in the implementation of this subsection, including guidelines for the resolution of conflicts when it may not be possible for one or more types of nonconforming site features to be brought into conformance with the requirements of this Ordinance because of particular site constraints or impacts upon adjacent properties. 
(C)  Exemptions These standards shall not apply to the reconstruction of a nonconformity damaged by an act of God or other natural disaster. 
(D)  Structural Alteration These standards shall apply to structural alterations, as provided in Section 36-97 of the Uniform Statewide Building Code. For the purposes of these standards, structural alternations only include activities that do not result in the expansion of a building. 
(1)  Determining Applicability For purposes of determining when site features must be brought into partial or full compliance with the standards of this Ordinance, the costs that constitute the assessed value of the structural alteration of a building or structure shall be as shown on the building permit application, and shall include the cost of materials and labor. 
(2)  General   
(a)  25 Percent or Less of Structure Value Structural alteration of a building or structure during a five-year period whose assessed value is 25 percent or less of the current assessed value of the building or structure shall not require any correction to nonconforming site features. 
(b)  More Than 25 Percent but Less Than 75 Percent of Structure Value Structural alteration of a building or structure whose assessed value exceeds more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of the current assessed value of the structure during a five-year period shall require that a corresponding percentage of the site features identified in Section 40.1-6.6(B), Applicability, be brought into compliance, until the site achieves 100 percent compliance. 
Example: a nonresidential site with nonconforming off-street parking (site feature) with an assessed value of $100,000 is undergoing remodeling equaling $40,000 (40 percent of the assessed value), the developer must add a corresponding number of additional required parking spaces until the site fully complies. The site at the time of remodel has 10 parking spaces, but the ordinance requires a minimum of 20 for the use that is proposed (10 more spaces are required for the site to be conforming), the applicant would be required to provide 40 percent of the 20 spacesor 8 more parking spaces, bringing the total number of spaces on the site to 18 spaces. 
(c)  75 Percent or More of Structure Value Structural alteration of a building or structure during a five-year period whose alteration is estimated to cost 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of the building or structure shall require 100 percent compliance with the site features identified in Section 40.1-6.6(B), Applicability. 
(d)  Two or Fewer Additional Parking Spaces When two or fewer additional off-street parking spaces are required under this subsection as a result of a redevelopment, such additional off-street parking is not required to be installed. 
(3)  Physically Constrained Properties- Comply to Maximum Extent Practicable Lands that are physically constrained (due to limited size, topography, or other environmental considerations) from complying with these provisions shall comply to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the Planning Director. 
(E)  Expansions Expansions to buildings or structures or use areas on sites with nonconforming site features identified in Section 40.1-6.6(B), Applicability, shall require compliance until the site achieves 100 percent compliance for site features in accordance with this section. 
(1)  General   
(a)  Expansions of 15 Percent or Less   
(i)  Additions or expansions that increase a building or structure or use area's size by 15 percent or less over a five-year period shall not require any correction to nonconforming site features. 
(ii)  This provision shall not be used to allow multiple, incremental, small-scale increases to a structure or use area without addressing nonconforming site features. 
(b)  Expansion between 15 and 50 Percent of Gross Square Footage Over 5 Years Expansion in any continuous five-year period, which results in an increase in the gross square footage of the existing building or structure or use area (measured at the beginning of the five-year period) greater than 15 percent, but less than 50 percent, requires a corresponding percentage of the nonconforming site features identified in Section 40.1-6.6(B), Applicability, to be brought into compliance, until the site achieves 100 percent compliance.

(3)  In accordance with Section 15.2-2209 and 15.2-2286(A)5, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, the city has adopted a uniform schedule of penalties for violations of this Ordinance, which shall include the maximum penalties allowed by the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. 
(a)  This schedule of offenses does not include any zoning violation resulting in injury to any persons, and the existence of these penalties shall not preclude action by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 15.2-2286(A)4 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, or action by the City Council under Section 15.2-2208 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. 
(b)  Each day during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. However, specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not be charged more frequently than once in any 10-day period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $5,000. 
(c)  Designation of a particular Ordinance violation for a penalty in accordance with this section shall be in-lieu of other sanctions, and except for any violation resulting in injury to persons, such designation shall preclude the prosecution of a violation as a criminal misdemeanor.

Any person summoned or issued a ticket for a scheduled violation may make an appearance in person or in writing by mail to the Department of Finance or the Treasurer of the city prior to the date fixed for trial in court. Any person so appearing may enter a waiver of trial, admit liability, and pay the civil penalty established for the offense charged. Such persons shall be informed of their right to stand trial and that a signature to an admission of liability will have the same force and effect as a judgment of court. 
(e)  If a person charged with a scheduled violation does not elect to enter a waiver of trial and admit liability, the violation shall be tried in the general district court in the same manner and with the same right of appeal as provided for by law. In any trial for a scheduled violation authorized by this section, it shall be the burden of the locality to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission of liability or finding of liability shall not be a criminal conviction for any purpose. 
(4)  If the alleged violator fails to correct the violation by the time limit set forth in the notice of violation, or any granted extension, or paid the appropriate penalty, and failed to timely appeal the notice of violation in accordance with Section 40.1-2.3(K), Appeal, the Zoning Administrator shall, after consultation with the City Attorney, take appropriate legal action in the circuit court of the City of Portsmouth, including requirements to correct and abate the violation.

A violation shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine that does not exceed the maximum allowed by the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. If the violation is uncorrected at the time of conviction, the court shall order the violator to abate or remedy the violation to comply with the violation, within a time period established by the court. Failure to remove or abate a zoning violation within the specified time period shall constitute a separate misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine that does not exceed the maximum allowed by the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended.

Failure to abate the violation within the specified time period shall be punishable by a fine of up to $5,000, and any such failure during any succeeding 10-day period shall constitute a separate misdemeanor offense for each 10-day period punishable by a fine of up to $7,500. However, no such fine shall accrue against an owner or managing agent of a Dwelling Unit during the pendency of any legal action commenced by such owner or managing agent of such Dwelling Unit against a tenant to eliminate an overcrowding condition. A conviction resulting from a violation of provisions regulating the number of unrelated persons in Dwelling Units shall not be punishable by a jail term. 
(7)  At any time after the filing of an injunction or other appropriate proceeding to restrain, correct, or abate an alleged violation of this Ordinance where the owner of the real property is a party to such proceeding, the Zoning Administrator may record a memorandum of lis pendens in accordance with Section 8.01-268 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. Any memorandum of lis pendens admitted to record in an action to enforce a violation of this Ordinance shall expire after 180 days. If the city has initiated an enforcement proceeding against the owner of the real property and such owner subsequently transfers the ownership of the real property to an entity in which the owner holds an ownership interest greater than 50 percent, the pending enforcement proceeding shall continue to be enforced against the owner. 
(8)  The city shall have such other remedies as are and as may from time to time be provided for or allowed by the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, for the violation of zoning, subdivision, and other provisions of the City Code. 
(9)  To the extent allowed by law, all such remedies provided herein shall be cumulative. To the extent that the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, may limit the availability of a particular remedy set forth herein for a certain violation or a part thereof, such remedy shall remain available for other violations or other parts of the same violation. 
(B)  Remedies for Failure to Obtain or Comply with a Certificate of Appropriateness In accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2209, the uniform schedule of civil penalties for failure to obtain or comply with an approved certificate of appropriateness in Table 40.1-7.5(A) Civil Penalties in Historic Districts, is adopted. The table does not include any zoning violation resulting in injury to any persons, and the existence of these civil penalties shall not preclude action by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 15.2-2286(4) of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, or action by the city under Section 15.2-2208 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended.

Downtown Districts and the D1 District  
40.1-9.1 - Specific Purpose of Downtown Districts 
The Downtown Districts are created for the purposes set forth in section 40.1-3.6(E) (1) and also, without limitation, for the promotion and preservation of the city's educational, cultural and economic interests, opportunities and advantages. Such districts include and bound the only significant tourist routes providing access to the many historic structures and buildings in downtown Portsmouth and to its historic waterfront and governmental center and contain many significant historic structures and buildings. 
The Downtown Districts fulfill this purpose through: 
(A)  The preservation and protection of buildings, structures, places and areas of educational, cultural, economic and civic interest in the core area of the original community settlement; 
(B)  The development and maintenance of appropriate settings and environment for such buildings, structures, places and areas; 
(C)  The protection and enhancement of the tourist corridors leading to the historic core area, governmental center and historic waterfront; 
(D)  The regulation and control of construction of new buildings and structures in accordance with the City's Comprehensive Plan, the Downtown Master Plan and Waterfront Strategy, and Downtown Design Manual, adopted by the city council to protect such areas and the setting and environment found, preserved and promoted therein. 
(E)  In addition to the above, an additional purpose of the D2 Form Based Code District is to provide a mechanism for implementing the following specific goals, using both public and private sector investment: Capitalizing on public investment in existing infrastructure; promoting compact, mixed-use development at moderate to high densities; ensuring transit-supportive and transit-serviceable development; requiring pedestrian-oriented and transit-oriented design; and ensuring compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods.  
40.1-9.2 - Downtown DistrictsPermitted Uses 
Uses permitted in the Downtown Districts shall be governed according to subdistricts, as shown on the zoning map. Table 40.1-9.2.1 in this Article of this Chapter lists the uses allowed in the various subdistricts. The designations and general purposes of the subdistricts are as follows: 
(A)  T3 subdistrict. The T3 (Urban Residential) subdistrict contains a mix of residential uses, but maintains a residential urban fabric. These areas, furthest from the Historic District, represent the least intense urbanism downtown. This subdistrict contains flexible dimensional requirements to allow development consistent with the design of existing downtown neighborhoods. 
(B)  T4 subdistrict. The T4 (General Urban) subdistrict contains a mix of uses, but maintains a predominantly residential urban fabric. These areas, nearest to the Historic District, represent moderately intense urbanism in the downtown. This subdistrict contains flexible dimensional requirements to allow development complimentary to and building upon the design of existing downtown neighborhoods. 
(C)  T5 subdistrict. The T5 (Urban Center) subdistrict contains a higher density mix of uses with primarily retail space at the ground floor. 
(D)  T6 subdistrict. The T6 (Urban Core) subdistrict is designed for high-density mixed uses. This subdistrict is the most intense land use Downtown. 
(E)  SD subdistrict. The SD (Special District) subdistrict is a low-density, limited mixed use district. This subdistrict is intended to provide employment with mixed-uses, including manufacturing, distribution and warehousing, as well as civic uses and supportive retail uses. In an effort to minimize land-use conflicts, this subdistrict is not generally suited for residential uses. 
(F)  The zoning map shall also identify those properties within the Downtown Districts where a Certificate of Appropriateness is required by the provisions of this Article. 
(G)  D2 District. The D2 District is a Form Based Code District designed to foster a setting for economic growth and development in a sustainable mixed-use pattern of diverse urban neighborhoods, integrating residential with employment and commercial uses (as well as recreational opportunities). All regulations and requirements concerning the D2 subdistrict can be found in Appendix B to Chapter 40.1 of the City Code.

40.1-9.5 - Administrative Deviations 
(A)  Authority. During the site plan review process, the Planning Director is authorized to approve limited administrative deviations to certain provisions of this Code, where, owing to special conditions, strict enforcement would be physically impractical. This optional process occurs only where the applicant requests an administration deviation to a standard as specified below. 
(B)  Permitted Deviations. The Planning Director will review the request in light of the intent of the applicable transect requirements. The Planning Director is authorized to approve an administrative deviation for the following standards: 
(1)  Height.   
(a)  Minimum and maximum story heightsup to ten percent for any one story, limit of five percent for any cumulative increase or decrease in building height. 
(b)  Street wall/fence requirementsup to ten percent. 
(c)  Finished floor elevationup to five percent. 
(2)  Siting.   
(a)  Required Building lineincrease of up to 6 inches (from the specified 20 inches to 26 inches in width). 
(b)  Required building line minimum percentage built-toreduction of up to five percent of required length. 
(c)  Street wall requirementsup to ten percent.

(2)  Deviations from these standards outside of those recommended by the Downtown Design Guidelines may be considered by the Planning Commission through a Type II Site Review. A written report/agenda shall accompany any application forwarded to the Committee. 
The Type II site review process will give the opportunity for appropriate deviations from the Code that are consistent with the City's goals and plans to revitalize the Downtown District. Examples of these deviations may include problems related to topography or street grade, the location of alleys and streets, breaks and passages between buildings, signs, streetscape details, design issues related to the inclusion of existing buildings or mature trees as part of a development proposal.  
40.1-9.6 - Application of Code 
(A)  General. There are two review processes: By-Right (administrative review) and Use Permit. The Use Permit process is dependent upon project size. Projects approved through the Use Permit process should nonetheless meet the intent of the Code. 
(1)  By-Right. Single Family Detached, Two-to-Four Family and Live/Work Dwellings are allowed by right. Non-residential projects of less than or equal to 45,000 gross square feet and less than or equal to 15,000 gross square feet footprint are able to build as a matter of right when they meet all of the standards of this Ordinance. 
(2)  Use Permit. A Use Permit is required for all Multi-Family and Townhouse Dwellings. A Use Permit is also required for non-residential buildings over 45,000 gross square feet or with floorplates over 15,000 gross square feet. Such sites will be required to meet the intent of the Code and will be evaluated in terms of how well they conform to the Code and meet other objectives of the Master Plan. The Use Permit process also provides the opportunity for community input as well as fine tuning of a development proposal to address issues that may not have been contemplated by the Code. Provided however, no use permit shall be required in the SD district based solely on building size. 
(Ord. No. 2015-83 , § 1(Exh. A, Amd. 28), 12-8-2015)  
40.1-9.7 - Parking

Where parking or loading is provided, parking shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of Section 40.1-5 of this Ordinance, with the exception of Section 40.1-5.1(D) and (E). Parking in the T3 district and T4 district south of Interstate 264 shall be in accordance with the number of spaces required in Table 40.1-5.1(E) (2). Single family residences are exempt from the 30 foot parking setback contained in this section.  
40.1-9.8 - Downtown Districts, Properties; Publicly-Owned Property 
The city manager or other appropriate city official shall file an application for a certificate of appropriateness for the proposed construction, alteration, renovation, or razing of any historic city-owned building or structure, and shall adhere to all other requirements of this division. For buildings and structures owned by other governmental entities or public utilities companies, the city manager or other appropriate city official shall request that such owners submit an application for a certificate of appropriateness and adhere to all requirements of this division. 
Nothing in this article or section shall be construed to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any such elements that the authorized city officers certify as required for public safety. 
For those properties within the Downtown Districts which are not required to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness, civic use buildings are exempt from the Dimensional and Density Requirements listed above.

(2)  Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports, horizontal members, roofs, chimneys, exterior wall elements such as siding, wooden walls, brick, plaster, or mortar occurs to the extent that it adversely affects the character of the district or could reasonably lead to irreversible damage to the structure or lead to a hazardous condition. 
(B)  The Committee shall monitor the condition of properties to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. In the event that the Committee receives a complaint or determines that a structure is being demolished by neglect, it shall notify the zoning administrator and the building official of such complaint or neglect stating the reasons for such notice, and shall set forth the steps that it believes need to be taken to remedy the situation.  
40.1-9.10 - Maintenance of Downtown Properties 
Nothing in this division shall be construed to prevent the normal repair and maintenance of any exterior architectural feature or ordinary yard maintenance in the Downtown Districts to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form. Normal repair and maintenance shall not include a material change in design, material, color or outer appearance and does not require a certificate of appropriateness. In addition, this paragraph does not prohibit any repair, maintenance, painting or alteration of any such feature that the building official certifies to be required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. 
Normal maintenance and repair shall include the following and similar actions which in the sole opinion of the Committee or its designated staff will have no greater effect on the character of the district than those listed: 
(A)  Repainting resulting in the same color.

40.1-9.20 - Certificate of Appropriateness; General Criteria for Approval. 
(A)  The Committee shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, cultural, historic, or architectural significance and value of the structure or the district in accordance with the Downtown Design Guidelines and the following: 
(1)  A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(2)  The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided. 
(3)  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken. 
(4)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
(8)  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(B)  In making its determination, the Committee shall further consider the compatibility of the proposed project with the standards and guidelines as adopted by city council in addition to any other pertinent factors. 
(C)  This section is not intended to discourage contemporary architectural expression, or to require the emulation of existing structures of historic or architectural interest in specific detail. Harmony, or incompatibility, shall be evaluated in terms of the appropriateness of the architectural features, materials, scale, size, height, and placement of a new structure in relationship to existing structures and to the setting.  
40.1-9.21 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Action Required on Application 
(A)  Upon receipt of a complete application for a certificate of appropriateness, the designated staff shall review the application to determine if a one, two, or three step approval process is required, as defined in the standards and guidelines adopted by the city council. 
(B)  For those reviews by the committee, staff shall place the application on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled Committee meeting for which it meets the deadline pursuant to the procedures manual. During the public hearing portion of the Committee meeting the Committee will confer with the applicant for the certificate of appropriateness and other parties that appear to voice an opinion on the project. After the public comment portion of the meeting has ended, the Committee members shall vote to either approve or disapprove such plans and specifications based on architectural compatibility and in accordance with the Committee's adopted standards and guidelines. 
(C)  If the application is approved, the Committee shall issue a certificate of appropriateness therefore with or without conditions or with such modifications of the plans and specifications as the Committee deems necessary and the applicant accepts to fulfill the purposes and objectives declared in section 40.1-9.1 and to require compliance with the regulations and restrictions set out in this chapter and the standards and guidelines as adopted by the city council. 
(D)  If issued, a certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for a period of one year from date of issuance. All work approved and initiated under a certificate of appropriateness shall be completed within one year of issuance. Without an extension, after one year from issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, an owner shall obtain a new certificate in order to commence any previously approved work or to complete any work. Once begun, no project or work shall be left partially completed. On written request from the applicant, the Committee may grant a single extension of its approval for a period of up to one additional year if, based upon submissions from the applicant, the Committee finds that conditions on the site and in the area of the proposed project are essentially the same as when approval was originally granted. 
(E)  Any certificate of appropriateness shall also expire and become null and void if such authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of 12 months after being commenced, or at such time the building permit issued for such work becomes no longer valid. Any period or periods of time during which the right to use any such certificate or permit is stayed pursuant to this article shall be excluded from the computation of the 12 months. 
(F)  During construction or installation, the certificate of appropriateness shall be posted on the property in a location where it shall be visible from the public right-of-way. A complete set of the approved plans shall be retained on the premises and shall be made available to designated staff. 
(G)  If the plans do not meet the Committee's adopted standards and guidelines or the applicant does not agree to the proposed conditions, the Committee shall deny the application. The Committee shall not under any circumstances issue a certificate of appropriateness containing conditions if the applicant does not consent to the conditions. 
(H)  In the event that the Committee rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit notification of such reasons and actions to the applicant in writing. The Committee may suggest any alternative courses of action it deems appropriate if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application. 
(I)  Where an application covers a material change in the appearance of a historic structure that would require the issuance of a building permit, the denial of the application shall be binding upon city staff charged with issuing building permits. In such a case, a building permit shall not be issued. 
(J)  The failure of the Committee to approve or disapprove such plans and specifications within 60 days from the date of application for the certificate, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time in writing, shall be deemed to constitute approval of the plans and specifications as submitted, and the building official shall issue any required permit, unless the planning director requests that the city council make a determination on the application pursuant to the appeal procedures established by this article.  
40.1-9.22 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Administrative Review and Approval 
Administrative review of an application for a certificate of appropriateness is permitted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(A)  The designated staff of the Downtown Design Committee may issue a certificate of appropriateness if authorized by standards and guidelines approved by the city council. 
(B)  The Committee's designated staff shall be guided by the standards and guidelines established for the Committee and shall have the authority to request of the applicant modifications of a specific proposal in order that such proposal may comply with said standards and guidelines. 
(C)  In any case where the designated staff is uncertain of his/her authority to act on a particular application, or in any case where the designated staff and the applicant cannot agree on changes in the proposal, or if the designated staff otherwise fails to issue such certificate within 30 days, the application shall be referred to the Committee for action. A written report/agenda shall accompany any application forwarded to the Committee. 
(D)  The designated staff shall report, in writing, to the Downtown Design Committee at each regular meeting on all certificates so issued. 
(E)  Notwithstanding the above, the building official, the zoning administrator, or their designees may order that work be stopped and that an appropriate application be filed for Committee review upon determination that the action being undertaken surpasses ordinary maintenance as defined in section 40.1-9.10 and a certificate of appropriateness is not displayed, or the work being performed is not in conformance with the approved action for which a certificate of appropriateness has been issued.  
40.1-9.23 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Undue Hardship Exception 
The Committee shall have the power to reduce or suspend any of the requirements of this article, if it finds that the application presents special circumstances whereby strict compliance will produce an undue hardship or if the spirit of the chapter has been met and deviation has been deemed to be in the best interest of the city. 
In granting a hardship the Committee shall make the following findings of fact in writing: 
(A)  Strict compliance with the regulation will deprive the property owner of all reasonable use of the property. 
(B)  The hardship results from application of the regulation to the property. 
(C)  The hardship is one that affects the property directly. 
(D)  The hardship is not the result of the property owner's own actions or omissions. 
(E)  The hardship is unique to the property and is not commonly shared by other similarly situated properties. 
(F)  Any financial considerations greatly decrease or destroy the property's value. 
(G)  The condition or situation of the property concerned is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this ordinance.  
40.1-9.24 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Demolitions 
(A)  The owner of an historic property or the owner of a building, structure, site, or object in any historic district, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to raze or demolish such building, or structure in accordance [with] of the Code of Virginia (1950), § 15.2-2306 A.3, as amended; provided, however, the owner must first have applied to the Committee for a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition. If the Committee denies the demolition request, the owner may appeal such denial to the city council. 
(B)  In the case of an application for demolition, if the Committee finds that it is physically or economically unfeasible to preserve an historic structure according to the above criteria, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. If preservation is found to be both physically and economically feasible, the Committee shall take or promote the taking of whatever public or private action that it deems likely to lead to such preservation, either on the site on which the historic structure is located or on another site to which it might appropriately be moved. Where preservation is feasible but the applicant still seeks demolition, the city may take any of the actions authorized by Code of Virginia (1950), § 15.2-2306 A.4, as amended. 
(C)  A decision by the Committee concerning a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of historic structures, sites, or objects shall be guided by: 
(1)  The historic, scenic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, or object. 
(2)  The importance of the historic structure, site, or object to the ambiance of a district. 
(3)  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location. 
(4)  Whether the historic structure, site, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city. 
(5)  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be. 
(6)  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the historic structure, site, or object from collapse. 
(7)  Whether the historic structure, site, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value.  
40.1-9.25 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Relocation of Historic Structure or Object 
A decision by the Downtown Design Committee concerning a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a historic structure, or object shall be guided by: 
(A)  The historic, scenic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, or object. 
(B)  The importance of the historic structure, site, or object to the ambiance of a district. 
(C)  Whether there are definite plans for the property to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be. 
(D)  Whether the historic structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
(E)  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the scenic, cultural, aesthetic, historical, and architectural character of the building, structure, site, or object.  
40.1-9.26 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Enforcement and Remedies 
(A)  Any violation or attempted violation of this article or of any condition or requirement adopted pursuant hereto may be restrained, corrected or abated by injunction or other appropriate proceeding pursuant to the Code of Virginia. 
(B)  After the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, city zoning inspectors shall from time to time inspect the alteration or construction approved by such certificate and shall give prompt notice to the applicant of any work not in accordance with such certificate or in violation of any ordinances of the city. If violations are not corrected in a timely manner, the certificate and building permit may be revoked. 
(C)  The zoning administrator, building official and designated city staff are authorized to order that work be stopped and that an appropriate application be filed or reviewed in any case where, in the inspector or designated staff's opinion, the work being performed is inconsistent with the character of the present structure or the prevailing character of the surroundings and the historic district or when it appears that the work exceeds the scope of an approved certificate of appropriateness. The Committee, upon review of the application may require the property owner to remedy such violations by restoring the affected property to its previous appearance.  
40.1-9.27 - Certificate of Appropriateness; Violations; Civil Penalties 
(A)  In accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2209, the following uniform schedule of civil penalties for violations of specified provisions of the zoning ordinance is adopted. The offenses does not include any zoning violation resulting in injury to any persons, and the existence of these civil penalties shall not preclude action by the zoning administrator under Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2286(4) or action by the governing body under Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2208.

If a person charged with a scheduled violation does not elect to enter a waiver of trial and admit liability, the violation shall be tried in the general district court in the same manner and with the same right of appeal as provided for by law. In any trial for a scheduled violation authorized by this section, it shall be the city's burden to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission of liability or a finding of liability shall not constitute a criminal conviction.

This chapter shall not prevent any demolition, repair, maintenance, painting or alteration of any such feature which the building official shall certify to be required by the public safety because of unsafe or dangerous condition.  
40.1-9.30 - Appeals 
(A)  Either an applicant or the planning director may appeal to the city council any final decision of the Downtown Design Committee regarding a certificate of appropriateness, provided such appeal is filed in writing with the Committee secretary within 30 days of the Committee's decision. The written appeal shall set forth any alleged error in the Committee's action or decision. The appeal shall state with specificity the nature of the error allegedly committed by the Committee in finding that the proposed erection, alteration, reconstruction or restoration of a structure would not be architecturally compatible with the historic properties, buildings or structures within the historic district. A conclusory statement of error without any allegations of specific facts shall be insufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. An appeal review committee consisting of the planning director and the city attorney or their designees shall initially review the written appeal. In the event that the planning director initiates an appeal, the city manager shall designate a city employee not employed in the department of planning to serve on the committee in place of the planning director. The committee shall determine whether the written appeal meets the requirements of paragraph (a) above. If the appeal fails to meet the requirements, the committee will deny the appeal on the grounds of insufficiency and so notify the applicant in writing. The notification shall provide the reasons for the denial. The applicant may appeal the committee's decision to the circuit court. If the committee finds that the applicant's appeal has stated sufficient grounds for an appeal, the appeal shall be forwarded to the city clerk who shall place it on the city council's agenda. The applicant shall be notified in writing when an appeal is forwarded to the city clerk. 
(B)  The filing of an appeal shall stay the Committee's decision pending the outcome of the appeal, except that such filing will not stay the Committee's decision if such decision denies the right to raze or demolish a building or structure. 
(C)  The city council shall reverse the Committee's decision only upon a finding of error in the Committee's actions or findings. If the city council affirms the Committee's decision, the applicant may appeal the city council's decision to the circuit court within 30 days after the final decision is rendered by the city council. 
(D)  The timely filing of appeal in the circuit court shall stay the city council's decision pending outcome of the appeal to the court, except that the filing of such petition shall not stay the decision if such decision denies the right to raze or demolish a building or structure.
