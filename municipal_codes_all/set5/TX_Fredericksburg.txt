PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fredericksburg, Texas. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
This 2010 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 20-001, adopted March 22, 2010, and was accomplished under the supervision of Colleen Dalton, Editor. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and Yolanda Vickers, Legal Tech Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Shelley Britton for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(1)  The city has the right and duty to provide legal representation through either the city attorney, or in it discretion through the selection of outside legal counsel, to any employee sued in connection with any claim for damages or other civil action arising out of the course of scope of employment, provided that such individual is entitled to indemnification as herein set forth. 
(2)  The city shall approve or reject counsel selected by the covered defendant in any criminal matter, but shall endeavor to approve the selection of the defendant if the selection is reasonable. 
(b)  Responsibilities of the employee. 
(1)  Employees must comply in all respect with this policy in order to mature any rights to indemnity or defense expenses. 
(2)  An employee may have his or her own counsel assist in the defense at the sole expense of the individual. 
(3)  Employees shall cooperate fully with the city in preparation and presentation of the case and in the resolution of conflict of interest issues; failure to do so shall waive such individual's right to representation and indemnity. 
(c)  Indemnification by the city. 
(1)  The city shall provide indemnification to an employee found liable for the payment of any claim or damages, excluding punitive damages. 
(2)  Whether the acts were done in good faith and within the course and scope of employment, shall be determined by the city, and such determination shall be final for the purpose of initial representation and indemnity; if, however, representation and indemnity have been denied by the city but upon a trial of the merits it is determined that the individual was acting in good faith and within the scope of employment, indemnification shall be granted and reasonable legal expenses incurred in the defense of the claim reimbursed.

Employee. The term, as used in this policy, is defined as all elected and appointed officials, employees, and volunteers including firemen and policemen of the city. 
Course and scope of employment. The term, as used in this policy, shall also include legislative, governmental and judicial functions performed for the city, but shall not be construed to include the activities of contract-type agents, consultants or contractors. 
Indemnification. The term, as used in this policy, shall mean providing security against damages, and exemption from incurred liabilities. 
(Ord. No. 6-062, § 8.803, 11-23-1994)  
Sec. 2-94. - Procedures. 
(a)  When any employee of the city is served with process in an action, he or she shall request representation. The request shall be forwarded by the employee to the city attorney no later than the second day after service is made. Forwarding of the request does not relieve the employee of any duty or effect of the proceeding, and no right to representation at the city's expense shall mature, nor shall any attorney-client relationship be established until the appropriate determination has been made and the employee is notified of such determination. 
(b)  With the advice of the city attorney, the city manager (or mayor in the event the city manager is the defendant) shall determine whether or not to initially grant indemnity under this policy and shall ascertain whether to permit outside counsel for the employee. The city attorney shall advise the city manager if a conflict or potential conflict exists. If a conflict exists (being such a juxtaposition of interest, claims, defense, or issues between the city or its employees, which under known or probable facts, would cause an ethical violation in the event of dual representation by a single attorney), the city manager shall authorize the use of outside counsel and will either (1) designate counsel for the employee, or (2) approve the choice of the employee, if any. The city manager must approve all contracts with such counsel. The employee does not have to utilize an attorney designated by the city manager, but in utilizing his or her own attorney assumes the obligation to pay all costs, fees and expenses in the litigation. If only a potential conflict exists, the city attorney will so advise the city manager. The city manager shall make a determination for the city as to whether or not the city will waive the conflict and agree to accept any litigation risk resulting from dual representation of the employee and the city by the city attorney's office or other counsel. The city manager shall determine to either (1) allow the employee to choose between outside counsel and the city attorney's office or (b) to deny approval of outside counsel. 
(c)  Where time does not allow the completion of the conflict resolution process set forth in the subparagraph (b), the city manager will authorize the employee to contact the designated counsel to timely file an answer or to meet other procedural deadlines. The city will pay legal expenses for any attorney for such purpose, but reserves the right to consent to or reject continuing representation by such attorney. Should the employee elect to utilize an attorney of their own selection, he or she assumes the obligation to pay all costs, fees and expenses of the litigation. The city will pay an amount not to exceed $200.00 for the employee to consult with an attorney of his or her choice on the necessity or advisability of separate representation. 
(d)  Where initial representation has been denied, no legally enforceable claim to indemnity or to defense expenses shall arise until after expiration of 45 days from the date of final judgment or final approval of settlement.

Wherever confined, such dog or cat shall be kept for a period of ten days for observation for rabies.

Where dogs are kept or housed on property without a fenced yard, the owner of such dogs, or persons having custody of such dogs, shall provide an enclosure containing not less than 100 square feet for two dogs maximum for the animals' use and exercise. Such enclosure shall be constructed of chainlink fencing or similar type materials with all four sides enclosed.

(2)  Shelter. The owner or other person having custody of an animal must provide a shelter for the animal. The shelter must be constructed and maintained in such a manner to allow the animal to remain dry and protected from the elements, including sun. Such shelter shall be fully enclosed on three sides, roofed and have a solid floor with bedding appropriate to the season. The entrance to the shelter shall be flexible to allow the animal's entry and exit, and sturdy enough to block entry of wind and rain.

(5)  If the Enforcement Officer determines that any owner, harborer or keeper of an animal is in violation of subsections (a) through (d) of this section relating to the humane care of animals, he or she will notify the owner, harborer or keeper of the animal of the violation by door tag, personal service or certified mail, and to immediately remedy the violation, specifying a time for compliance, not to exceed three days following which, if the person has not complied with the requirements of the Enforcement Officer, the person may be found guilty of a violation of this section. After the second conviction within any six-month period, the Enforcement Officer may apply to the Municipal Judge for a warrant to seize such animal. The animal will be impounded at the city Animal Control Facility. The Municipal Judge will hold a hearing and determine the disposition of the impounded animal, which shall be in the judge's determination to the owner of the animal, a humane organization designated by the animal control officer, or the city animal control facility for humane destruction, which destruction shall occur following the expiration of any required appeal period.

This prohibition shall not apply to any structure for which a permit is obtained from the building official, after determination by the building official of the City that the structure will not be injurious or a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public nor that it will interfere with the provision of public services or utilities. The issuance of a permit shall create no continuing rights with regard to the structure and in the event its removal is required by any public official or agent thereof such structure shall be promptly removed by the permittee upon notice or removed the city without notice.

The building official's determination as to whether or not to have plans reviewed by an independent service, as well as what service will be used, shall be conclusive. 
(b)  Upon the building official's determination that the plans will be reviewed by an independent service, the fees charged by such service shall be passed through to the applicant, and shall be paid by the applicant to the city prior to the city incurring the same.

(5)  All buildings other than residential must be wired in conduit, EMT, armored cable or ENT. Existing buildings converted from residential to commercial use must be electrically conduit, EMT, armored cable or ENT. An inspection by the city electrical inspector and a certificate that the building's wiring is serviceable and in conduit, EMT, armored cable or ENT from a master electrician licensed in Fredericksburg is required before the building can be used for commercial purposes.

State Law reference Local governments must adopt ordinances necessary for jurisdiction to qualify for National Flood Insurance Program, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.3145; political subdivision to comply with federal requirements, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315. 
 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 5-312. - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
Development means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Elevated building means a non-basement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminary determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminary determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior; or 
b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
(5)  Designated as a rated structure under the history preservation ordinance of the city. 
Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 5-345. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The appeal board, which shall be the board of adjustment of the city as established by the community, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this division. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 5-344 of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this division, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in this section are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(l)  The appeal board (board of adjustment) shall utilize the same administrative procedures regarding application deadlines, organization of the board, quorums, conduct of meetings and the like as it uses when sitting as a board of adjustment in zoning matter; provided, however, that a majority of the members present and voting shall be required for actions of the board.

(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Code 1992, § 3.705(A))  
Sec. 5-365. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 5-314, subsection 5-343(8); or subsection 5-366(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in section 5-344, is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subparagraph 4b. of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of section 5-344, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subparagraph 5b. of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Code 1992, § 3.705(B))  
Sec. 5-366. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with this chapter. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of sections 5-315, 5-344, and the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which are greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 5-314 or subsection 5-343(8) of this chapter. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Code 1992, § 3.705(C))  
Sec. 5-367. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-314, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 5-344, are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Code 1992, § 3.705(D))  
Sec. 5-368. - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-314, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If the above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

ARTICLE XII. - LANDSCAPING 
 
Sec. 5-421. - Purpose. 
The purpose of landscaping and screening requirements is to improve certain setback and yard areas, including off-street vehicular parking and open-lot sales and service areas, for all uses other than one family, duplex, triplex or fourplex residential uses in Fredericksburg and to aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement, and to protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of surrounding neighborhoods. 
(Code 1992, § 3.901)  
Sec. 5-422. - Definitions. 
The following specific definitions shall apply to the landscaping and screening regulations contained in this article: 
Landscaping. Landscaping shall consist of any of the following or combination thereof: materials such as, but not limited to, grass, ground covers, flowers, vines, hedges, trees, native plant materials, planters, brick, stone or natural forms, water forms, aggregate or other landscape features, but not including the use of smooth concrete or asphalt. The use of brick, stone, aggregate or other inorganic materials shall not predominate over the use of organic plan materials. 
Shrubs. Self-supporting, woody, evergreen species as normally grown in Gillespie County. 
Dripline. The periphery of the area beneath a tree that would be encompassed by perpendicular lines dropped from the farthest edges of the crown of the tree. 
(Code 1992, § 3.902)  
Sec. 5-423. - Landscaping requirements for certain yard areas and off-street parking. 
(a)  Areas to which this section applies. All areas used for the display or parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not (here referred to as "off-street parking areas"), and all areas upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use (hereinafter referred to as "other vehicular use areas"), including, but not limited to, activities of a drive-in nature such as filling stations, grocery and dairy stores, banks and restaurants shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements herein provided. Exceptions include: areas used for parking or other vehicular uses under, on or within buildings; parking areas and other vehicular use areas serving one family, duplex, triplex or fourplex uses, as normally such residential areas are voluntarily landscaped; and expansions and changes in use of existing improved properties. 
(b)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in a good workmanship-like manner and according to accepted good planting procedures with the quality of plant materials as herein described. All elements of landscaping, except plant materials other than hedges, shall be installed so as to conform to all other applicable ordinances and city codes. Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular encroachment as herein provided. 
(c)  Maintenance. The owners, tenants and their agents, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping provided for under this article. All landscaping shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. All landscaped areas shall be provided with either a readily available water supply with at least one outlet located within 100 feet of all plant materials to be maintained, or an underground sprinkler system. Landscaped areas adjacent to pavement areas shall be protected with curbs or equivalent barricades. 
(d)  Plant materials. 
(1)  Crowns. Trees shall be species having an average mature spread of crown of at least 15 feet and having a trunk(s) which can be maintained in a clear condition over five feet of clear wood. Trees having an average mature spread crown less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a 15 foot crown spread. 
(2)  Species. Tree species shall be a minimum of seven feet overall height immediately after planting. 
(3)  Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs shall be a minimum of 15 inches in height when measured immediately after planting. Except as provided for herein, hedges shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid, visual screen within a reasonable time after planting. 
(4)  Vines. Vines shall be a minimum of 24 inches in height immediately after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens or walls to meet physical barrier requirements as herein specified. 
(5)  Ground covers. Ground covers used in lieu of grass, in whole or in part, shall be planted in such a manner as to present the appearance of reasonably complete coverage within three months after planting. 
(6)  Lawn grass. Grass areas shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns in Fredericksburg. Grass areas may be sodded, plugged, sprigged or seeded, except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. In areas where other than solid sod or grass seed is used, rye grass seed shall be sown for immediate effect and protection until coverage is otherwise achieved. 
(e)  Required landscaping adjacent to public rights-of-way. On the site of a building or open lot use providing an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area, where such area will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or structure from any abutting right-of-way, excluding dedicated alleys, there shall be provided landscaping between such area and such right-of-way, as follows: 
(1)  A strip of land at least five feet in depth, located between the abutting right-of-way and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area which is exposed to an abutting right-of-way, shall be landscaped. Such landscaping shall include one tree for each 50 lineal feet or fraction thereof of right-of-way (street) frontage. Such trees shall be located between the abutting right-of-way and off-street parking area or other vehicular use area and shall be planted in a plating area of at least 25 square feet, with each dimension at least five feet in length. In addition, a hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier of at least two feet in height shall be placed along the perimeter of such landscaped strip. If such durable barrier is of nonliving material, for each ten feet thereof, one shrub or vine shall be planted abutting such barrier but need not be spaced ten feet apart. Such shrubs or vines shall be planted along the street side of such barrier, unless they are of sufficient height at the time of planting to be readily visible over the top of such barrier. The remainder of the required landscape areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape treatment, excluding paving. 
(2)  All property other than the required landscaped strip lying between the right-of-way and off-street parking area or other vehicular use area shall be landscaped with grass or other ground cover. 
(3)  Necessary accessways from the public right-of-way through all such landscaping shall be permitted to service the parking or other vehicular use areas. 
(f)  Perimeter landscaping related to abutting properties. On the site of a building or structure or open lot use providing off-street parking areas or other vehicular use area, where such areas will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or structure from abutting property, that portion of such area not so screened shall be provided with a wall or fence or hedge or other durable landscape barrier, not greater than eight feet in height nor less than 3½ feet in height, to form a continuous screen between the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area and such abutting property. Such landscape barrier shall be located between the common lot line and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area exposed to the abutting property, provided the purpose of screening the off-street parking areas and other vehicular use areas is accomplished. If such barrier consists all or in part of plant materials, such plant materials shall be planted in a planting strip of not less than 2½ feet in width. In addition, one tree shall be provided for each 75 lineal feet of such landscape barrier or fractional part thereof. Such trees shall be located between the common lot line and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area. Each such tree shall be planted in at least 25 square feet of planting area, with each dimension at least five feet in length. Each such planting area shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape material, excluding paving, in addition to the required tree. The provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable in the following situations: 
(1)  Where a property line abuts a dedicated alley, or to those portions of the property that are opposite a building or other structure located on the abutting property. 
(2)  Where a proposed parking area or other vehicular use abuts an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier on an abutting property, said existing barrier may be used to satisfy the landscape barrier requirements of this subsection, provided that such existing barrier meets all applicable standards of this article and protection of hedges against vehicular encroachment is provided. 
(3)  Where the abutting property is zoned for business uses, only the tree provision with its planting area as prescribed in this section shall be required; however, the number of trees may be reduced to one tree for each 125 lineal feet or fractional part thereof. 
(g)  Parking area interior landscaping. 
(1)  Off-street parking areas shall have at least ten square feet of interior landscaping for each parking space, excluding those spaces abutting a perimeter for which landscaping is required by other sections hereof and excluding all parking spaces which are directly served by an aisle abutting and running parallel to such a perimeter. In addition, other vehicular use areas shall have one square foot of landscaped area for each 100 square feet or fraction thereof of paved area for the first 50,000 square feet, excluding the first 5,000 square feet of paved area, plus one square foot of landscaped area for each 200 square feet or fraction thereof of paved area for all paved area over 50,000 square feet; provided, however, in areas zoned for industrial use, these requirements shall be reduced by 50 percent. Where the property contains both parking areas and other vehicular use areas, the two types of areas may be separated for the purposes of determining the other vehicular use by first multiplying the total number of parking spaces by 400 and subtracting the resulting figure from the total square footage of the paved area. Each separate landscaped area shall contain a minimum of 50 square feet, with each dimension at least five feet in length, and shall include at least one tree having a clear trunk at least five feet in height, with the remaining area adequately landscaped with shrubs, ground cover or other authorized landscaping material not to exceed three feet in height. 
(2)  The total number of trees shall be not less than one for each 100 square feet or fraction (over one-half) thereof of required interior landscaped area. Such landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving. 
(3)  In other vehicular use areas, where the strict application of this section will seriously limit the function of such area, the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved area including such perimeters which may be adjacent to a building on the site. Such interior landscaping that is relocated as herein provided shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements of subsection (e) of this section. 
(4)  The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any interior landscaped area where such area is at least 3½ feet in depth adjacent to the abutting parking space and protected by wheel stops or curbing. Two feet of such landscaped area may be part of the required depth of each abutting parking space. 
(5)  Parking lot storm drainage shall be designed so as to direct water from the paved areas to the landscaped areas to allow absorption into the permeable ground prior to discharge into a public street or storm drainage system. This should be accomplished in a manner not likely to result in erosion. 
(h)  Traffic sign distance for landscaping adjacent to public rights-of-way and points of access. When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way, all landscaping within the triangular areas described below shall provide unobstructed cross visibility at a level between three feet and six feet in height; provided, however, trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-visibility area may be allowed if they are located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, other than grass or ground cover, shall not be located within three feet from the edge of any accessway pavement. The triangular areas above referred to are: 
(1)  The areas of property on each side of an accessway formed by the intersection of the accessway and the public right-of-way line, with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection along the accessway and public right-of-way lines respectively, and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two other sides. 
(2)  The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way, with two sides of the triangular area being 25 feet in length along the public right-of-way lines, measured from their point of intersection, and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two lines. 
(i)  Landscape preservation. The existing natural landscape character (especially native oaks, elms and pecan trees) shall be preserved to the extent reasonable and feasible. In an area containing a stand of trees, the owner and developer shall use best good faith efforts to preserve such trees. In determining whether there is compliance with this section, the building official shall consider topographical constraints on design, drainage, access and egress, utilities, and other factors reasonably related to the health, safety and welfare of the public which necessitated disturbance of the land's natural character, the nature and quality of the landscaping installed to replace the existing natural landscaping, and such other factors as may be relevant and proper. Indiscriminate clearing or stripping of the natural vegetation on a lot is prohibited. 
(Code 1992, § 3.903)  
Sec. 5-424. - Credits toward landscaping requirements. 
In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, in whole or in part, for purposes of off-street parking or other vehicular use areas, the building official may adjust the application of the herein-described standards to allow credit for such plant material if, in his/her opinion, such an adjustment is in keeping with and will preserve the intent of this article. Any credit shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Each square foot of landscaped area which is permeable and within the area encompassed by the dripline of a tree of at least four inches in trunk diameter, measured four feet above the ground level, shall count 1½ square feet of landscaped area for the purpose of satisfying the minimum requirements of subsection 5-423(f) of this article. 
(2)  Each square foot of landscaped area which is permeable and within the area encompassed by the dripline of a tree of at least eight inches in trunk diameter, measured four feet above the ground level, shall count as two square feet of landscaped area for the purpose of satisfying the minimum requirements of subsection 5-423(f) of this article. 
(3)  The foregoing credits shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions: 
a.  Tree dripline area shall not qualify for credit under this section if: 
1.  Less than one-half of the dripline is permeable cover. 
2.  There have been any damaging changes in the original grade of the dripline under the tree. 
b.  The total calculated landscaped credit around the tree shall be limited to the total square footage of area within the dripline. 
c.  Neither overlapping dripline areas nor areas contiguous to the dripline areas which overlap shall be counted twice. 
d.  Permeable paving shall be considered a permeable cover. 
(Code 1992, § 3.904)  
Sec. 5-425. - Screening requirements and standards. 
(a)  Other areas not covered by subsection 5-423(e) of this article shall be subject to requirements of this section. Minimum landscaped screening requirements shall be provided in the following situations: 
(1)  Multiple-family (greater than four units) and mobile home uses along property lines abutting a single-family district. 
(2)  Commercial use along property lines abutting any residential district. 
(3)  Civic use along property lines abutting a more restrictive district in which the use is not permitted.

ARTICLE XIII. - STORMWATER CONTROL 
 
Sec. 5-455. - Purpose and applicability. 
(a)  The growth in and around the City of Fredericksburg and the associated development and construction of buildings, paved surfaces, roads and other improvements has altered in the past and continues to alter the natural flow of surface waters on the land, which together with the construction of gutters, culverts, drains and channels for the carrying off of surface waters has both increased the quantity of stormwater and amplified the peak flow rates of runoff, thus leading to present and potential flooding of property and homes, dangerous flows within and over public roadways and streets, and soil and channel erosion. 
(b)  It is the intention of the city council to protect the health and safety of the citizens and visitors of the community and to prevent damage to private property and public facilities through the proper design and construction of both on-site and regional stormwater detention facilities that prevent or adequately reduce increases in peak flow rates of runoff that may otherwise increase the risk of flooding and the associated risk of public endangerment, property damage and erosion. 
(c)  It is also the intention of the city council to protect the health and safety of the citizens and visitors of the community and to prevent damage to private property and public facilities through the installation and use of temporary and permanent erosion control practices that prevent or adequately reduce increases in erosion and siltation that may otherwise increase the risk of flooding and the associated risk of public endangerment and property damage by clogging and/or partial filing of constructed or natural drainageways as well as drainage structures and detention ponds. 
(d)  It is the intention of the city council, through this article, to establish a method of maintaining natural flowage of water and stormwater detention both through the establishment of requirements for individual property owners who develop their property and through the design and construction of regional stormwater detention facilities so that, where practical, the most effective protection from flooding may be accomplished. 
(e)  It is the intention of the city council to establish a regional stormwater detention pond program for the design and construction of regional stormwater detention facilities so that, where practical, the most cost-effective protection from flooding may be accomplished. 
(f)  This article shall apply to all property within the corporate city limits and the extra-territorial jurisdiction (ETJ) of the city unless otherwise stated. 
(g)  Subsections 5-456(b) and (c) and section 5-458 of this article shall not apply to: 
(1)  Single family or duplex residential lots, of whatever size, which exist as such and are zoned as such (inside the city limits) or are restricted as such (outside the city limits) prior to the adoption of this article. This exemption shall not apply in cases where there is a prior agreement between owners or developers and the city which addresses drainage issues; in which case, the terms of the agreement shall control. 
(2)  Residential lots (restricted as such) in the extra territorial jurisdiction of the city that contain no more impervious ground cover than 20 percent of the gross lot surface area exclusive of any area within the 100 year flood plain. 
(3)  Single lots, multi-family or non-residential lots of one-half acre or less which exist as such and are zoned as such (inside the city) or are restricted as such (outside the city), prior to the adoption of this article. 
(4)  Entire subdivisions or resubdivisions containing one-half total acre or less or resubdivisions resulting in less total number of lots than the original subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 9-001, § 3.1100, 2-1-1999)  
Sec. 5-456. - Standards and requirements for stormwater detention. 
(a)  The placing of fill material or the construction of impervious cover or construction or placement of any other structure on any property subject to this division, or the performance of any excavation or grading in a manner which alters the surface flow of water across said property in a manner which damages any adjacent property is prohibited except as provided in subsection (c) below. 
(b)  No final subdivision plat, subdivision construction plan, site plan or building permit shall be approved by the city unless it can be demonstrated by the owner or developer of such property that the proposed development or improvement will not result in the additional identifiable adverse flooding of other property or public facilities, including roadways. This is to be demonstrated by a certified professional engineer's submittal of sufficient data and calculations acceptable to the city. 
(c)  The alteration of the flow of surface water shall be permitted upon accomplishment by the owner or developer of property subject to this article of one of the following: 
(1)  Design and construction of an on-site stormwater detention facility, or facilities, by the land owner or developer which limits the peak flood flows from the proposed development to the existing peak flood flows from the subject tract. 
(2)  Construction of, or participation in the construction of, off-site drainage improvements, such as storm inlets, storm sewers, culverts, channel modifications, land filling, and/or other drainage facilities such that the peak flood flows for fully-developed watershed conditions from the watershed area in which the proposed development is located will be sufficiently and safely passed without flooding of adjacent and downstream property and roadways. 
(3)  Design and construction of the development utilizing limited impervious cover, infiltration of runoff from impervious cover via flow through pervious areas, and/or grass-lined swales or channels such that these measures result in a minimal increase in peak flood flows from the development. 
(d)  Acceptance of requests from land owners or developers to meet the stormwater detention requirements through measures listed in subsections 5-456(c)(2) and 5-456(c)(3) above in lieu of the requirement of subsection 5-456(c)(1) above is solely at the discretion of the city. The construction or acceptance of the same by the city shall not relieve the owner of responsibility under civil law to adjacent and down stream properties. 
(e)  Acceptance by the city of on-site stormwater detention plans will be based on the suitability and adequacy of the engineering and technical design of the proposed stormwater detention facilities, as described in section 5-459 below. 
(Ord. No. 9-001, § 3.1101, 2-1-1999)  
Sec. 5-457. - Regional detention pond program. 
A regional stormwater detention pond program will be established by the city at its sole discretion in areas where it determines that regional solutions are preferable to site-by-site solutions. The city will design and direct construction of, or otherwise facilitate construction of, regional stormwater detention ponds in order to prevent increases in and, if practical, to reduce peak flows of stormwater run off. 
(Ord. No. 9-001, § 3.1102, 2-1-1999)  
Sec. 5-458. - Standards and requirements for erosion/sediment controls. 
(a)  No final subdivision plat, subdivision construction plan, site plan or building permit for any property containing a total of five acres or more shall be approved by the city unless the plans for the proposed development include temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures such that siltation of downstream drainageways are minimized. 
(b)  The above requirements shall be accomplished through a combination of the following practices: 
(1)  Installation of silt fences and rock berms before and during construction in order to reduce on-site soil erosion and provide temporary capture of sediment. 
(2)  Temporary and/or permanent revegetation of bare ground in order to stabilize distributed soil at the earliest practical date. 
(3)  Construction of on-site stormwater detention facilities by the land owner or developer in a manner such that detention ponds function as temporary sedimentation basins until permanent revegetation of the subject tract is accomplished. 
(4)  Other measures which may be necessary to control erosion and sedimentation on a site-by-site basis. 
(Ord. No. 9-001, § 3.1103, 2-1-1999)  
Sec. 5-459. - Additional standards for approval. 
(a)  A registered professional engineer, licensed in the state and qualified and experienced in the design and operation of stormwater detention ponds and related stormwater management facilities, shall perform the hydraulic and structural design of stormwater detention ponds and related stormwater management facilities, including the development of engineering and technical information required for evaluation by the city.

All detention and runoff calculations, including computer model simulations, if used, shall be provided. The city's review shall be based upon the most current flood protection planning study. 
(c)  All on-site stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to adequately and safely pass all stormwater inflows, including flood flows and runoff from upstream and adjacent properties that have natural and/or existing overland flows toward and onto the subject tract. The on-site stormwater detention facilities should not impound stormwater onto or cause backwater to inundate any upstream or adjacent properties in excess of existing conditions. 
(d)  On-site stormwater detention facilities shall not be placed such that they encroach into the regulatory 100-year floodplain as established by the city, Gillespie County, and/or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless it can be satisfactorily demonstrated to the city through the use of hydraulic modeling that such encroachment will not cause any rise in the 100-year flood level on other off-site properties or that increase in the 100-year flood level caused by such encroachment will occur entirely onsite on the owner's or developer's property. 
(e)  Additional engineering and technical rules and guidance with respect to the application and review of the stormwater detentions requirements of this article will be provided by the city within a drainage criteria manual. 
(f)  All design and technical information necessary to thoroughly evaluate the suitability and adequacy of proposed erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be provided to the city for review.

ARTICLE VIII. - CABLE TELEVISION RATE REGULATIONS[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Federal law reference Basic cable television service rates may be regulated by a local government according to federal regulations, 47 USC 543. 
 
Sec. 8-206. - General provisions. 
The following regulations are hereby adopted and shall be the cable TV regulations for the city. 
(Code 1992, § 4.901)  
Sec. 8-207. - Definitions. 
Unless otherwise apparent, the following definitions shall apply in this article: 
Affiliated programmer. An affiliated programmer is a programmer with an ownership interest of five percent or more including general partnership interest, direct ownership interest, and stock interest in a corporation where such stockholders are officers or directors or who directly or indirectly own five percent or more of the outstanding stock, whether voting or nonvoting. Such interest include limited partnership interest of five percent or greater. 
Basic service tier. The basic service tier shall, at a minimum, include all signals of domestic television broadcast stations provided to any subscriber (except a signal secondarily transmitted by satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station, regardless of how such signal is ultimately received by the cable system), any public, educational, and governmental programming required by the franchise to be carried on the basic tier, and any additional video programming signals or service added to the basic tier by the cable operator. 
Cable operator. Cable operator means any person or group of persons who provides cable service over a cable system within the city under a franchise issued by the city, and who directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable system, or who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable system. 
Cable programming service. Cable programming service includes any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless of service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming, other than: 
(1)  Video programming carried on the basic service tier as defined in this section; 
(2)  Video programming offered on a pay-per-channel or pay per-program basis; or 
(3)  A combination of multiple channels of pay-per-channel or pay-per-program video programming offered on a multiplexed or time-shifted basis so long as the combined service: 
a.  Consists of commonly-identified video programming; and 
b.  Is not bundled with any regulated tier of service. 
City. The City of Fredericksburg, Texas. 
Commission. The Federal Communications Commission. 
Small system. A small system is a cable television system that serves fewer than 1,000 subscribers. The service area of a small system is determined by the number of subscribers that are served by a system's principal headend, including any other headends or microwave receive sites that are technically integrated to the system's principal headend. 
(Code 1992, § 4.902)  
Sec. 8-208. - Information to be provided by cable operator on monthly subscriber bills. 
A cable operator must provide the following information to subscribers on monthly bills: 
(1)  A statement substantially the same as the following: "the basic service tier rates and related equipment and installation charges are regulated by the city. If you have any questions or comments regarding these rates, you may call or write the city at [address and telephone number]"; and 
(2)  The FCC community unit identifier for the cable system. 
(Code 1992, § 4.903)  
Sec. 8-209. - Negative option billing. 
A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. This provision, however, shall not preclude the addition or deletion of a specific program from a service offering, the addition or deletion of specific channels from an existing tier of service, or the restructuring or division of existing tiers of service that do not result in a fundamental change in the nature of an existing service or tier of service, provided that such change is otherwise consistent with applicable regulations. Subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment is not an affirmative request for service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or equipment may be made orally or in writing. 
(Code 1992, § 4.904)  
Sec. 8-210. - Subscriber bill itemization. 
(a)  Cable operators may identify as a separate line item of each regular subscriber bill the following: 
(1)  The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee. 
(2)  The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels. 
(3)  The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. In order for a governmental fee or assessment to be separately identified under this section, it must be directly imposed by a governmental body on a transaction between a subscriber and an operator. 
(b)  The charge identified on the subscriber bill as the total charge for cable service should include all fees and costs itemized pursuant to this section. 
(Code 1992, § 4.905)  
Sec. 8-211. - Rates for the basic service tier. 
(a)  Basic service tier rates. Basic service tier rates are subject to regulation by the city in order to ensure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 47 USC 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this article, not to exceed the "Initial Permitted Per Channel Charge" or the "Subsequent Permitted Per Channel Charge" as described below, or the equipment charges as specified in section 8-212, will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service their shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 8-212 of this article. 
(b)  Initial permitted per channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier and this article has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, rates "in effect on the initial date of regulation" or "in effect on September 30, 1992," shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
a.  A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or 
b.  The charge specified in subparagraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, as applicable: 
1.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
2.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and; 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
3.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and; 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost of service showing, or; 
(2)  The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index ("GNPPI") published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNPPI for the relevant period, the per channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  Categories. External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of channels; 
4.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including providing public, educational, and governmental access as required by the city; 
5.  Retransmission consent fees; and 
6.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or charges in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or 180 days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after 180 days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmer shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Code 1992, § 4.906)  
Sec. 8-212. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service tier. 
(a)  Scope. The equipment regulated under this section consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth below. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, and additional connections separate from rates for basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installation under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 8-213. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the Hourly Service Charge ("HSC") methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase cost of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC = EB - CE/H 
Where, 
EB = annual equipment basket cost; 
CE = annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and 
H = person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year. 
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following formula: 
Monthly Charge = UCE + (HSC × HR) 12 
Where, 
HR = average hours repair per year; and 
UCE = average annual unit cost of remote. 
Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the foregoing paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customers premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this article. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city. 
(Code 1992, § 4.907)  
Sec. 8-213. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the city. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional, or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fee, local taxes, and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ration of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated below, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ration of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ration of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however, shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ration of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier and equipment, any direct OL indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing equipment, and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. 
(h)  Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Code 1992, § 4.908)  
Sec. 8-214. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational, and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Code 1992, § 4.909)  
Sec. 8-215. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than code entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based of an actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the HSC, as defined in section 8-211 of this article, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two times in a 12 month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any 12 month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges. 
(f)  For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge. 
(Code 1992, § 4.910)  
Sec. 8-216. - Notification of proposed rate increase. 
(a)  A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or associated equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is effective. The notice shall include a provision stating that protest to such prices may be filed with the city at 126 W. Main Street, Fredericksburg, Texas, 78624, or at City Hall, Attn. City Manager. The notice shall also include a statement that such protests must be filed with the city no later than 30 days after the notice is received by the subscriber. 
(b)  In addition to the notice required in paragraph (a) of this section, the cable operator shall give the city a minimum of 30 days advance written notification of any changes in rates for cable programming service or associated equipment. 
(Code 1992, § 4.911)  
Sec. 8-217. - Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. 
(Code 1992, § 4.912)  
Sec. 8-218. - City review of basic cable rate and equipment costs. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission to the city. Provided, however, that the city may toll this 30-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in paragraph (d) of this section within 30 days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 8-219 hereof will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city council meeting held at any time during the initial 30-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to the city manager, and must be received prior to the end of the 30-day review period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined herein, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to this article, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge as defined in this article hereof, the city may toll the 30-day deadline in paragraph (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For an additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this paragraph, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or orally during at least one city council meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days permitted in paragraph (d) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the 90 or 150 day periods, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. Provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the 90 or 150-day period permitted in paragraph (d) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid. 
(Code 1992, § 4.913)  
Sec. 8-219. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of its ordinance, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b), the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  If a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Act, Chapter 552, Texas Government Code, the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Open Records Act, regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for non-disclosure. 
(Code 1992, § 4.914)  
Sec. 8-220. - Burden of proof. 
(a)  A cable operator has the burden of proving that its existing or proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 USC 543, and sections 8-211 and 8-212 hereof. 
(b)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier or associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost of equipment as set forth in sections 8-211 and 8-212, the cable operator must submit the appropriate FCC form to the city. 
(c)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier that exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in sections 8-221 and 8-222 hereof, the cable operator must submit to the city a cost-of-service showing to justify the proposed rates. The cost-of-service showing must in conformance with accounting and cost allocation requirements as adopted and amended by the commission for cable system operators. 
(Code 1992, § 4.915)  
Sec. 8-221. - Small systems. 
(a)  Option 1. 
(1)  A small system, as defined in section 8-217, may certify that the small system's initial rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with section 8-211 hereof. A certification by a small system under this section shall be filed with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. The certification shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system, and shall be verified. 
(2)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber. The city may request additional information from the operator in order to verify the certification.

The final NIMS was released on March 1, 2004. The HSPD-5 requires that state and local governments adopt the NIMS by fiscal year 2005 as a pre-condition to the receipt of federal grants, contracts and activities related to the management and preparedness for certain disaster and hazard situations.

No rating shall be considered vested and the same may be established or changed at any time in accordance with subsections 23-58(d) and 23-58(e) below. Additionally, structures or properties may have more than one rating (e.g., the main structure may be high but an addition or Appurtenance may be medium or low): 
(1)  High rating. The most significant Resources identified in the 2002 Fredericksburg Historic Resource Survey. These properties are considered to be outstanding, unique, or good examples of architecture, engineering, or design. Some are unique to the Fredericksburg area and are indicative of German-Texan vernacular forms and/or building techniques. Others are noteworthy examples of 19th and early 20th century architectural types, styles, and forms, erected using local building materials and construction technologies. Properties designated with a high rating are to be the most protected from alteration and demolition. 
(2)  Medium rating. Resources that may or may not be identified as architecturally significant on an individual basis, but are nonetheless valuable resources that add to the historic district's overall character, and may be so ranked due to their or its proximity or contribution to the cultural, historic, architectural, or archeological character of the historic district or surrounding properties. These properties may have been moderately altered or are typical examples of a common architectural style or form, but generally retain their historic integrity to a good or moderate degree. Properties designated with a medium rating shall be protected from demolition and where possible will be required or encouraged to maintain or improve architectural features. 
(3)  Low rating. Resources that minimally enhance the district's ability to convey a sense of time and place. These properties may be typical examples of more recent, common local building forms, architectural styles, or plan types; be examples of distinctive building forms, architectural styles, or plan types that have been significantly altered; lack the necessary age to meet the usual 50 year threshold for possible National Register of Historic Places listing and do not appear to meet the National Register of Historic Places standard for exceptional significance for properties less than 50 years of age, but which nevertheless may have relative value within the historic district, meriting preservation. Properties or improvements with a low rating may be considered for relocation or demolition upon a determination by the Historic Review Board that the same can be accomplished with little or no consequence to the historical, cultural, architectural, or archeological character of the district or property. 
Resource. A landmark, landmark site, and all land or water within a preservation district, together with the structures, Appurtenances and improvements, if any. The term Resource includes, but is not limited to, separate districts, buildings, structures, sites, objects, landscape features, and related groups thereof.

Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. A set of ten basic philosophical principles created by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and administered by the National Park Service, to help preserve the distinctive character of a historic building and its site, while allowing for reasonable change to meet new needs. The Standards for Rehabilitation are codified at 36 CFR 67, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with guidelines for preserving, rehabilitating, restoring, and reconstructing historic buildings. Basic philosophical principles (standards) and recommended actions and approaches (guidelines) developed by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, for each of the four primary treatment options for historic properties: preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction.

Standards for signs, additional. Basic requirements and guidelines as are established in the Sign Ordinance for the City of Fredericksburg. 
Unreasonable economic hardship. The inability of an owner to obtain a reasonable return or a reasonable beneficial use from a resource as required by the United States Supreme Court in Penn Central Transportation Company vs. New York City , 438 U.S. 104 (1978), and subsequent decisions, and as further defined by the provisions of Section 23-64 below.

Alternates shall not participate in constituting a quorum or in voting if all regular members of the Board are present, and then only so many of them as are necessary to constitute seven (designated by the Chairman) shall participate in any meeting or action of the Board. 
(j)  The Board shall otherwise determine its own rules of procedure except as may be specifically set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-58. - Designation of historic districts, historic landmarks, and preservation priority rating. 
(a)  Historic districts. Historic district zoning designation. The City Council may, from time to time, after receiving a recommendation either for or against such designation by the Historic Review Board and Planning and Zoning Commission, designate certain areas in the City as historic districts, and define, amend, or eliminate the boundaries of same. Such districts shall bear the word "historic overlay" in their zoning designation. Such designation and the requirements thereof shall be in addition to any other zoning district designation or requirement established in the City's zoning ordinance and in this article. All zoning maps shall reflect the historic district by the letters "HO" as a suffix to the use designated. This area shall encompass the area shown on the map adopted herewith and on file in the office of the Historic Preservation Officer, as may be amended from time to time. 
(b)  Historic landmarks. Historic landmark designation. The City council may, from time to time, designate individual property, part or parts thereof or a Resource thereon (Resources) in the City as historic landmarks. Each such property or Resource shall bear the words "historic landmark" (HL) in its zoning designation. Such designation shall indicate that such property/Resource is subject to the terms of this article. Provided, however, with regard to site plans, uses, setbacks and other development and/or building regulations, such property shall be governed by its zoning district. Initially, the historic landmarks shall consist of the properties shown on the list adopted herewith and on file in the office of the Historic Preservation Officer as may be amended from time to time. 
(c)  Criteria. 
(1)  Historic district criteria. In making the designation of an area as a historic district, the City council shall affirmatively find that the area has one or more of the following characteristics: 
a.  Character, interest, or value as a part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the City; 
b.  Location as the site of a significant historical event; 
c.  Embodiment of distinctive characteristics of an architectural type or specimen; 
d.  Relationship to other distinctive buildings, sites, districts, or structures which are historically significant; 
e.  Unique location of singular physical characteristics representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community or the City; 
f.  Value as an aspect of community sentiment or public pride; 
g.  Identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the development or culture of the City, the state or the nation; 
h.  Value as protective of a historical resource. 
(2)  Historic landmark criteria. In making the designation of a place as a historic landmark, the City council shall follow the criteria set forth in the historic district criteria subsection of this section as the same relate to an individual property, part of a property or Resource thereof. 
(d)  Establishment of preservation priority rating. At such time as a Resource/property is either incorporated into the historic district or designated as a historic landmark, such Resource/property shall be rated high, medium, or low by the Board. The Board shall rate the same at its meeting considering the request or application and the Board's rating shall become effective at such time as the City Council either incorporates the Resource/property or designates it as a historic landmark. Appeals of the rating (see section 23-66 below) may occur only following incorporation into the historic district or following designation as a historic landmark, and shall follow the procedure set forth below. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant seeking to change the rating. 
(e)  Changes to district and landmarks. 
(1)  Districts. Changes to the same may be initiated by any person by request submitted to the Historic Review Board which will forward its recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the submittal to the City council. The Historic Review Board shall consider the request at a meeting held in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 23-61(f) below. Upon forwarding of a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the designation process will follow the procedures provided for in section 5.200 of the City's zoning ordinance, pertaining to hearing and action by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. Applications for changes in the boundaries of the historic district shall be on forms and shall contain the information required thereon as determined by the City's Historic Preservation Officer and shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in subsection 23-61(c). An application initiated by the Historic Review Board or the City staff shall not require the payment of a fee. 
(2)  Landmarks. The designation of new historic landmarks or the removal of the designation may be initiated by any person by request submitted to the Historic Review Board which will forward its recommendation to the City Council. The Historic Review Board shall consider the request at a meeting held in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 23-61(f) below. The City Council shall consider the request at the next regular meeting of the City Council following the meeting of the historic review Board at which the request was heard. Applications for designation of or changes to historic landmarks shall be on forms and shall contain the information required thereon as determined by the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in subsection 23-61(c) unless initiated by the Historic Review Board or City staff. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-59. - Review required by Historic Review Board or Historic Preservation Officer. 
(a)  No person or entity shall install, construct, reconstruct, alter, change, restore, remove, or demolish any Resource, structure or exterior architectural feature or other significant appurtenance of any historic landmark or of any building or structure located within the historic district unless and until such person or entity has completed review of his/her/its proposed changes by the Historic Review Board or the Historic Preservation Officer, and has obtained a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the further provisions hereof. 
(b)  Such review shall consist of the granting or denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness with regard to the subjects set forth in sections 23-62, 23-63, as applicable. With regard to the subject matters thereof, obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness is mandatory and compliance with its requirements is mandatory. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-60. - Certificates of Appropriateness. 
(a)  No exterior feature of any Resource, whether designated as a landmark or whether located in the historic district, shall be installed, constructed, reconstructed, altered, changed, restored, removed, or demolished, nor shall any new structure be constructed in the historic district until after a Certificate of Appropriateness of such work has been issued by the Board or by the Historic Preservation Officer as applicable. Additionally, neither a demolition permit nor a building permit may be granted for a property in the historic district or designated as a landmark unless the Board or Historic Preservation Officer issues a certificate of appropriateness. 
(b)  Certificates of Appropriateness shall be issued by the Board. Provided however, if the application sought to be approved under this article qualifies as an Insignificant Alteration (SEE DEFINITION OF INSIGNIFICANT ALTERATION ABOVE), an Administrative Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued by the Historic Preservation Officer as an administrative approval without review by the Board. 
(c)  Therefore: 
(1)  In reviewing, approving and denying applications for certificates, the Board and the Historic Preservation Officer shall seek to accomplish the purposes of this article. 
(2)  All decisions of the Board and Historic Preservation Officer shall be in writing and shall state the findings, recommendations or requirements. The same may appear in the written minutes of the Board's meetings. 
(3)  A certificate shall expire 12 months after its issuance and shall continue as long as work is not discontinued for a period of 12 months in which case a new certificate is required. 
(4)  An application for certificate of Appropriateness shall not be resubmitted for review sooner than 12 months following its initial review unless it is submitted with a significant change, or if the originally approved plans have changed significantly as determined by the Historic Preservation Officer with an additional fee. 
(5)  Certificates of Appropriateness may be issued for distinct and separate phases of an ongoing project. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-61. - Certificates; application and procedure. 
(a)  Application. The applicant shall submit to the Historic Preservation Officer application for certificate of appropriateness which includes data and information in writing which thoroughly describes the project as determined by the Historic Preservation Officer, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Name and signature of applicant and property owner.

(3)  Location of property which is the subject of the application. 
(4)  A detailed description of the nature of the proposed work. 
(5)  A description of the history of the property or the measures taken to determine the same, and how the proposed change will be in character with the architectural or historical aspect of the structure or site. 
(6)  Any circumstances or conditions concerning the property or financial hardship which may affect compliance with the article. 
(7)  Drawings and photographs of all sides of the Resource which would explain the proposed work. 
(8)  Color chips of the colors which will be used, and examples and/or samples of other materials requested to be used which are not original to the Resource. 
(b)  Completeness. The applicant shall submit all required data and information to the Historic Preservation Officer, not less than 14 days prior to the next scheduled regular meeting of the Board. The application shall not be accepted and processed until it is deemed complete by the Historic Preservation Officer, including sufficient description to adequately and completely convey the full effect of the work to be done. In cases which do not require Board review, the Historic Preservation Officer shall have at least five business days to review a completed application. 
(c)  Fee. An administration fee will be assessed to the applicant reflecting the cost to the City for processing the application. (See appendix A to this Code.) The application will not be deemed complete, nor will it be processed until such fee is paid in full. 
(d)  Insignificant alteration. If the Historic Preservation Officer determines that the application is for an Insignificant Alteration (SEE DEFINITION OF INSIGNIFICANT ALTERATION ABOVE), or if the Historic Preservation Officer receives an application to renew an expired certificate of appropriateness, he/she may, within 14 days, approve the application and issue or deny the certificate of appropriateness. The Design Guidelines for the City of Fredericksburg, The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and The Secretary of the Interior's Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, the Sign Ordinance will be used when assessing the application. These documents will be made available to the public in the office of the City secretary and/or Historic Preservation Officer on the City's website, and/or at the local public library. 
(e)  All other alteration. If the Historic Preservation Officer determines that the application does not qualify as an Insignificant Alteration, or for any other reason does not desire to act under subsection (d) above; he/she shall refer the application to the Board and call for a meeting of the Board to consider the Certificate of Appropriateness application. 
(f)  Time for approval. The Board shall hold a meeting to consider the application within 40 days after the receipt of a completed application. The applicant shall be given notice of the time and place of the meeting by regular mail to the applicant's address on the application or, if provided, solely to the email address of the applicant. Notice of the meeting and subject matter shall be posted in accordance with the Texas Open Meetings Act. The Board may hold any additional meetings within 60 days following submission of a completed application as may be necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this article. The applicant or his/her agent or representative, shall attend at least one meeting of the Board during which his/her application is considered, otherwise the Board shall not take action, and the application will be deemed to be incomplete and added to the agenda of the next regular meeting of the Board for up to two additional times, and if the applicant or his/her agent or representative fails to attend, then the application shall be deemed withdrawn. The Board shall make its determination and report the same to the Historic Preservation Officer within 60 days after receipt of a completed application unless the Board and the applicant mutually agree to extend the period of review. If action is not taken within 60 days after receipt of a completed application, (except as to demolition cases as set out below) it shall be deemed that the Board recommends approval of the application and the certificate of appropriateness will be issued. The certificate of appropriateness shall be issued within three days following the decision of the Board. 
(g)  The Historic Preservation Officer shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for administrative approvals within 14 days following receipt of a completed application. If it is not issued for whatever reason the same shall be presented to the Board and processed as a regular application. 
(h)  Special time period for demolition. Anything in this article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board shall make its determination within 120 days after receipt of a completed application for a permit to demolish a historic Resource, landmark or building within the historic district, a historic landmark or Resource outside the historic district, or to move a historic landmark, or to move a building (Resource) into or out of a historic district. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-62. - Criteria for approval of a certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  In determining the recommendation and action on an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Officer and historic review Board shall review and decide the appropriateness of the proposed work of the following with regard to: 
(1)  Removal, addition or modification of architectural detail. The distinguishing historic qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. Removal or modification of any historic material or distinctive architectural features may be accomplished upon issue of a certificate of appropriateness; however, this should be avoided when possible. Architectural features include, but are not limited to, exterior wall materials, windows, railings, decorative woodwork, masonry, or stone elements. 
(2)  Paint color and application. Traditionally, the base colors of Fredericksburg's buildings have been soft muted shades of greens, blues, whites, and tans. In order to continue the historic integrity of the buildings in the district, these colors continue to be acceptable today, and do not require review or issuance of a certificate. The Historic Preservation Officer shall determine whether the proposed color is within the approved list of colors, as outlined in the Fredericksburg Design Guidelines. If the Historic Preservation Officer determines the color is inconsistent with said guidelines, then the proposed color application will be referred to the Board for approval or denial. Base colors such as vibrant or "hot" shades, deep dark shades, and black shades are not acceptable. A certificate of appropriateness must be granted in advance of paint application. The painting of existing materials such as unpainted stone or unpainted masonry is prohibited. 
(3)  New construction in historic districts. The Board will review all new construction plans within historic districts in order to ensure visual compatibility with the surrounding buildings and environment in relation to design, height, gross volume, massing, scale, proportion, and setback in accordance with the Design Guidelines. 
(4)  Additional criteria for issuance of certificate of appropriateness. The Board will also consider and make determinations on the following additional criteria prior to the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. It will consider the following as to new construction as are applicable. 
a.  The proposed change will not negatively impact the general historic, cultural, unique, and architectural nature of the historic district or landmark. 
b.  The proposed change will not negatively impact exterior architectural features. 
c.  The proposed change to the general design, arrangement, texture, color, and material of the building, or structure, will be compatible with and not negatively impact the relation of such factors to similar features of buildings, or structures, in the district. This consideration shall not be the aesthetic appeal of the structure to the Board nor the proposed remodeling, but rather its conformity to the general character of the particular historic area involved. 
d.  The signage conforms to the general historic, cultural, and architectural character of the historic district or landmark and the City's Sign Ordinance. 
e.  The Design Guidelines for the City of Fredericksburg, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, the Secretary of the Interior's Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Sign Ordinance, will be used when assessing the application subject to the further requirements of all applicable city ordinances. These documents will be made available to the public in the office of the Historic Preservation Officer or on the City's website. 
f.  The importance of finding a way to meet the current needs of the property owner and the importance of approving plans that will be economically reasonable for the property owner to carry out. 
(b)  The decision of the Historic Preservation Officer or the decision of the Board, as applicable, are mandatory, and must be met in order to receive a certificate of occupancy upon completion of construction. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-63. - Demolition/removal. 
(a)  In addition to the requirements of obtaining Board approval for demolitions, all demolitions in the City of Fredericksburg which are required to have a demolition permit, will be reviewed by the Historic Preservation Officer prior to the issuance of a demolition permit by the Building Official of the City. This is to assure that a historic Resource is not inadvertently overlooked in the rating or landmark designation process. If the Historic Preservation Officer determines, with 14 days following the submission of a request to demolish that the Resource should be preserved, then the demolition permit will be abated for a period of 120 days. During such time, the Historic Preservation Officer shall process the Resource under the historic landmark or rating provisions of this Article, and if it is determined to be a historic landmark, or require rating or re-rating, then the provisions of section (b) below will be used to further process the demolition request. The application for demolition will contain the information and be on the forms described in section 23-61(a) above. No building permit will be issued for any demolition of a historic structure which is subject to regulation under Chapter 23 Article III, Historic Preservation of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Fredericksburg unless a building permit for the construction of the replacement structure at the same site is issued at the same time. 
(b)  In addition to the criteria specified in section 23-62, the following additional criteria will be used when reviewing and determining the recommendation and action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness with regard to demolition or removal or relocation, as applicable, of a historic landmark or a Resource within a historic district: 
(1)  The demolition, removal or relocation of a historic Resource with a rating of "high" or the demolition or removal of a historic Resource with a rating of "medium" in the Fredericksburg Historic Resource Survey is strictly prohibited. 
(2)  The demolition, removal or relocation of a Resource with a rating of "low," or of a historic resource not rated in the Fredericksburg Historic Resource Survey, may occur only when the Board issues a certificate of appropriateness for that express purpose. Refer to section 23-55 and the Fredericksburg Historic Resource Survey for a more detailed definition of the preservation priority rating system. 
(c)  As an exception to (b) above, any Resource with a rating of Medium or Low may be relocated within the same tract of land upon which it is located, or to a tract so close as to be considered essentially the same location, if permitted by the Board which must issue a certificate of appropriateness for such purpose, and the Board may place reasonable conditions and safeguards for the Resource when issuing its Certificate. 
(d)  As a further exception to (b) above, a resource may be demolished or removed if the Board determines that it is a hazardous or dangerous building, or that the requirements of section 23-64, economic hardship, below are met. 
(e)  The Design Guidelines for the City of Fredericksburg, The Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation and The Secretary's Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings will be used to guide the Board in decisions regarding issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or removal of a Resource, historic landmark or within the historic district when permitted. 
(f)  In the case of a demolition application, the Board shall affirmatively find that: 
(1)  Reasonable measures could not be taken to adaptively reuse, rehabilitate, or restore the Resource building or structure at its existing site; 
(2)  Reasonable measures have been taken to relocate the Resource to a new site first within the same property, secondly within the historic district (if applicable), or thirdly to an area that will be enhanced by the Resource or where the goals of this article will be furthered and that the same cannot reasonably be done; 
(3)  The condition of the Resource building or structure is such that it has been so altered or deteriorated that it has lost its value for promoting the goals of this article, and is no longer significant, and in such event that the condition is not due to demolition by neglect or action of the owner or another related person or entity; 
(4)  Plans for proposed new construction or other reuse of the property, and their effects on the historical, cultural, social, or architectural identity of the surrounding area will be positive and promote the goals of this article. 
(g)  In the case of a removal application, the Board shall affirmatively find that: 
(1)  Reasonable measures could not be taken to adaptively reuse, rehabilitate, or restore the Resource building or structure at its existing site; 
(2)  The Resource is no longer significant to the area in which it is situated; 
(3)  Reasonable measures have been taken to relocate the Resource within the same property, and that the same cannot reasonably be done; 
(4)  Reasonable measures have been taken to relocate the Resource within the historic district (if applicable), or that it will be relocated to an area that will be enhanced by the resource and where the goals of this article will be furthered; and 
(5)  That the condition is not due to demolition by neglect. 
(h)  In making the determination to permit demolition or removal of a historic Resource, the Board may place reasonable conditions on the same even if such conditions are not related to the mandatory requirements of this article but which are related to the demolition or removal, and to ensure compliance with the plans approved by the Board. The same may include, but is not limited to, the requirement that all conditions be fulfilled prior to issuance of a building permit for the original Resource's location. 
(i)  Prior to demolition, the Historic Preservation Officer may, as a condition of approval of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or removal, require the owner, at the owner's expense, to provide documentation of the subject Resources in accordance with the standards of the Historic American Building Survey. Such documentation may include photographs, floor plans, measured drawings, an archeological survey, or other information specified. 
(j)  The special time period for demolition as described in section 23-61(i) above shall apply to all requests under this section. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-64 - Economic Hardship. 
No Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition or removal as applicable, involving a claim of economic hardship may be approved by the Board, nor shall a demolition permit be issued by the city based upon economic hardship unless the Board finds: 
(1)  The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return in its current or rehabilitated state, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible, and 
(2)  The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return, and 
(3)  Earnest and reasonable efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed, and 
(4)  The property cannot be moved or relocated to another site, similar site or within the District. 
(5)  Reasonable return, for the purposes of determination of economic hardship shall include consideration of the following information, but is not limited thereto: 
a.  Purchase date price and financing arrangements; 
b.  Current market value; 
c.  Form of ownership; 
d.  Type of occupancy; 
e.  Cost estimates of demolition and post demolition plans for development;

h.  Costs and engineering feasibility for rehabilitation; 
i.  Property tax information; 
j.  Rental rates and gross income from the property; 
k.  Other additional information as deemed appropriate. 
(6)  Claims of economic hardship by the owner shall not be based on conditions resulting from: 
a.  Evidence of demolition by neglect or other willful and negligent acts by the owner; 
b.  Purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of purchase; 
c.  Failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs; 
d.  Failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants; 
e.  Failure to provide normal improvements or accommodations for tenants. 
(7)  That throughout the process, the applicant has consulted in good faith with the Historic Preservation Officer, local preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property. 
(Ord. No. 27-007, 7-5-2017)  
Sec. 23-65. - Prevention of demolition by neglect. 
(a)  Duty to maintain. All historic Resources landmarks and all significant buildings, objects, sites, and structures located in the historic district, shall be preserved against decay, deterioration, and kept free from certain structural defects by the owner thereof or such person, persons, or entities who may have custody or control thereof. Such owners, or other persons shall repair such building, object, site, or structure if it has any of the following defects: 
(1)  Deteriorated or inadequate foundations; 
(2)  Defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety; 
(3)  Members of walls or other vertical supports that split lean, list, or buckle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration;

(b)  Neglect. 
(1)  Determination of neglect. If the Board upon recommendation or presentation by the Historic Preservation Officer or a building official of the City or his or her designee, makes a determination that a Resource is being demolished or deteriorated by neglect, it shall direct the Historic Preservation Officer to notify the owner or owners of the Resource of this preliminary determination, stating the reasons therefor, and shall give the owner of record 30 days from the date of such notice to correct the defects or present to the Board a plan for remediation if the defect cannot be remedied within such 30-day period. 
(2)  Subsequent determination. If, within 30 days following such initial determination, the Board shall again determine that the resource is being demolished or deteriorated by neglect, it may direct the Historic Preservation Officer to file a complaint for a violation of a zoning ordinance of the City, against the owner or owners if the necessary repairs are not completed within 90 days of the second determination by the Board that the subject building or structure is being demolished or deteriorated by neglect. 
(3)  City stabilization. Additionally, the Historic Review Board may direct the Historic Preservation Officer to accomplish the repairs necessary to stabilize and protect the Resource. The City shall then pay therefor, and charge the expenses incurred in doing such work or having such work done or improvements made to the record owner of such Resource.

The City shall not unreasonably withhold, condition, or delay grant of approval of a licensed professional engineer, licensed in the State of Texas and employed or engaged by Applicant to undertake such engineering and field evaluation. City shall accept and rely on such documentation, but reserves the right to perform, or have a firm retained by City perform its own engineering and field evaluation. City's engineering requirements and determinations shall be within its reasonable discretion. 
(2)  As-built drawings. Within ten days following completion of installation of any Facilities or any relocation or enlargement of the same, Permittee, or any Person using in any way the City's Public Rights-of-Way, shall provide "as built" drawings and specifications to the City of the Facilities placed in, on, over, under, or above the City's Public Rights-of-Way. 
(3)  Specifications. All excavations, alterations, backfill, repairs, and other work must be made in conformance with any written specifications or requirements adopted by the City. The Director may allow modifications of a specification if unusual circumstances are present, the modifications would comply with the spirit and intent of the specification, and the modification would not adversely affect the public safety or interest. 
(4)  Boring and encasing. If the Director determines it is impractical to excavate within a street, all pipelines, conduits, or other crossings must be bored, tunneled, or drilled under the paved section, and, if required by the Director, the crossings must be encased in a manner approved by the Director. 
(5)  Damage to City streets. Any type of ditching equipment used on City streets must be equipped with street pads. All damage done to public right-of-way and other public property during the work must be repaired by the permit holder to City specifications. If the permit holder fails to make the repairs, the Director may make the repairs and charge the cost to the permit holder. 
(6)  Correction of defects. If a permit holder fails to properly restore the surface of the public right-of-way or other public property, abandons the work, or fails to correct a hazardous condition after notice to do so, the Director may take any action necessary to restore the right-of-way, complete the work, or correct the hazardous condition at the permit holder's expense. 
(7)  Bonds. For good cause, and if necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the Director may require as a condition to the issuance of a right-of-way work permit or before work begins under the permit, that the applicant or permit holder post a bond to insure the repair of streets or the completion of the proposed work or to ensure compliance with any other requirement of this article. 
(8)  Debris on public rights-of-way. During the work, the public right-of-way must be kept clean of excessive rubbish, earth, mud, rock, and other debris, to the satisfaction of the Director.

(4)  the concentration of people, animals, and vehicles at assembly points will not significantly impair proper fire and police protection or ambulance service to areas at or near such assembly points or the City or County as a whole; 
(5)  a Parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point of termination without unreasonable delays in route;

(7)  successful completion of all required pre-event inspections. 
(b)  The City Manager is authorized to interpret the requirements in Section 36-9(a), and has the authority to modify the same, to fit individual circumstances where the standard cannot be strictly met, is inapplicable to the specific Special Event, or if additional modifications are deemed necessary by individual City departments for the safe and orderly conduct of a Special Event. The City Manager is further authorized to require an Applicant to institute other safeguards or activities to protect the safety of the public from circumstances which may arise from a specific Special Event.

(2)  The Special Event, if held, would violate the Special Event Rules and Regulations, the Special Event Planning Guide, any City ordinance or any other applicable law; 
(3)  The City manager determines that there is a false or misleading statement or omission of material fact on a Special Event Application, and the same is not corrected within the time for submission of an application; 
(4)  The Applicant has violated this ordinance or has had a Special Event Permit revoked within the preceding 12 months; 
(5)  The Applicant fails to provide proof of a license or permit required by any City ordinance or other applicable law for the Special Event;

(3)  The City Manager, or other City Official in the absence of the City Manager as described above, may revoke a permit wherein a material false or misleading statement or omission of material fact on a Special Event Application is discovered after the Special Event Permit was issued, so that the terms of the permit would require significant revision or if the scope of the Special Event has so changed that the terms of the original permit require significant revision which presents an unreasonable burden on the City resources. 
(Ord. No. 2019-26, § 1, 9-3-2019)  
Sec. 36-11. - Appeal. 
(a)  If the City Manager denies the issuance of a Special Event Permit, or revokes an issued Special Event Permit, the Applicant shall promptly be notified in writing.

(b)  If a City Official other than the City Manager revokes an issued Special Events Permit, the Applicant shall promptly be notified in writing. Such written notice shall include the reasons for the decision to deny or revoke the Special Event Permit. The Applicant may appeal the denial or revocation to the City Manager which shall make a ruling on the appeal and attempt to resolve the issue if time permits prior to the event.

The standards established within this Subdivision Ordinance for dedication and construction of public facilities and infrastructure are based upon engineering studies and historical usages and demands by different categories of development. 
B.  Minimum Level of Service Necessary 
This Subdivision Ordinance identifies certain minimum requirements and sizes for utilities, roadways, parks, and other facilities that have been determined by the City Council to be necessary in order to provide the minimum level of service necessary to protect or promote the public health, safety, and welfare and to ensure the quality of life currently enjoyed by the citizens. 
1.  It is the intent of this Subdivision Ordinance that no development occur until, and unless, these minimum levels of service are met. 
2.  Therefore, each Subdivision in the City shall be required to dedicate, construct or upgrade required facilities and infrastructure to a capacity that meets these minimum levels. 
C.  Minimum Standards for Public Infrastructure 
1.  For each category of public infrastructure, a minimum standard of infrastructure has been developed based upon historic studies and construction projects of the City and other cities. 
2.  The minimum standards take into consideration the soil standards, the topographic configuration of the City, the use and impact analyses in developing standard specifications. 
3.  The minimum standards reflect the minimum level of facilities that can be built to meet the health, safety and welfare of the citizens.  
6.02. - Adequate Public Facilities

C.  Rough Proportionality and Fair Share Policy Statement 
1.  There is a direct correlation between the increased demand on public facilities that is created by a new development, and the City's requirements to dedicate Right-of-Way and Easements and to construct a fair and proportional share of Public Improvements that are necessary to offset such impacts such that new development does not negatively affect the City as a whole. 
2.  The City desires that a new development project contribute its fair and proportional share of such costs.

(c)  The Developer's proportional share of the street construction shall be determined by the Developer's engineer and approved by the Director of Public Works and Utilities. 
(d)  If the Developer disagrees with the Director of Public Works and Utilities' decision of rough proportionality (see Section 6.02.C Rough Proportionality and Fair Share Policy Statement for reference), then the Developer may file a Subdivision Proportionality Appeal (see Section 7.02 Subdivision Proportionality Appeal). 
c.  Existing Streets 
i.  Cases Where Existing Right-of-Way does not Meet Minimum City Standards 
(a)  Where Subdivisions are adjacent to existing streets and the Right-of-Way widths of those existing streets are less than the minimum Right-of-Way width as set out in this Subdivision Ordinance for all streets, the Developer may be required to dedicate on the plat the Right-of-Way width required adjacent to the land being platted to bring the existing street to Right-of-Way width as set out in this Subdivision Ordinance. 
(b)  In the case of a Subdivision that is served by existing streets, and the Right-of-Way widths of such streets do not meet the minimum requirements of subsection 6.12.F Street Design Criteria, the developer shall dedicate the following Right-of-Way, as appropriate to the situation as described below: 
(i)  One hundred (100) percent of the Right-of-Way necessary to bring the street into conformance with subsection 6.12.F Street Design Criteria for a local or collector street, whichever is needed to serve the development, when the Subdivision abuts both sides of the existing street; or 
(ii)  One-half of the Right-of-Way necessary to bring the streets into conformance with section 6.12.F Street Design Criteria for a local or collector street, whichever is needed to serve the development, when the Subdivision abuts only one side of the existing street.

ii.  Cases Where Additional Right-of-Way is Needed above the Minimum Standard 
Streets may currently exist by reasons of Plat, metes and bounds description, general description or by prescription. If the existing geometrical configuration does not address safety, design, topography, and traffic management considerations, then the City may require the dedication of additional Right-of-Way to address such. 
(a)  Adjacent to a platted Subdivision: 
The Right-of-Way dedication shall be based upon the distance from the platted Subdivision boundary. Reasonable geometric adjustments will be made to accommodate safety, design, topography, and traffic management considerations. 
(b)  Along a Right-of-Way described by a metes and bounds or a general written description: 
The Right-of-Way dedication shall be based upon the geometric centerline of the Right-of-Way as described. Reasonable geometric adjustments will be made to accommodate safety, design, topography, and traffic management considerations. All existing Right-of-Way dedication within the Subdivision shall be converted from "separate instrument" to a platted Right-of-Way by being a part of the Final Plat. 
(c)  Along a prescriptive Right-of-Way: 
The Right-of-Way dedication shall be based upon the apparent centerline of the existing pavement or of the travel way if unpaved. Reasonable geometric adjustments will be made to accommodate safety, design, topography, and traffic management considerations. The Developer shall indicate on the Preliminary Plat and Final Plat property lines and features which identify prescriptive Right-of-Way. These features may include fences, borrow ditches, utility lines, drainage improvements, limits of plowed or improved fields, etc. All existing prescriptive Right-of-Way dedications within the Subdivision shall be converted from prescriptive to a platted Right-of-Way by being a part of the Final Plat. 
2.  The Director of Development Services may grant a Minor Subdivision Waiver reducing the Right-of-Way standards found in Table 9: Minimum Street Design Criteria up to five (5) feet to accommodate development in existing neighborhoods (e.g., an existing street does not meet the current standard) or if unusual circumstances exist on the property or on adjacent property that make it difficult to comply with the Right-of-Way standard. 
E.  Street Classification Descriptions

a.  Local Streets distribute traffic to and from residences. 
b.  Local Streets are short in length and non-continuous to discourage through traffic. 
c.  A Local Street is a street used primarily for access to abutting property especially residential areas. Local Streets also provide secondary or minor access and circulation to community facilities (school, parks, etc.) and other traffic generators such a commercial and industrial areas. Local streets will be designated as Type A Local Street, Type B Local Street, Type ETJ Local Street, and Marginal Access Local Street based on the function they serve as described below. 
i.  Type A Local Street 
This type Local Street shall be used for primary and secondary access to single-family detached residential units or duplex residential units where such residential units comprise 75 percent of the abutting street frontage on both sides of the street of a particular block.

This type Local Street shall be used for primary and secondary access to all residential areas except those specified to be served by a Type A Local Street local street. Also, this street shall be used for secondary access and circulation to community facilities (schools, parks, etc.) and other traffic generators such as commercial and industrial areas. 
iii.  Type ETJ Local Street 
This type Local Street shall be used for primary and secondary access to all residential areas outside and not adjacent to the city limits, not served by city water and wastewater, and where Type A Local Street and Type B Local Street sections are inappropriate due to the rural character of the neighborhood and/or the lack of storm drainage facilities to tie into curb and gutter design. 
iv.  Marginal Access Local Street 
This type of Local Street is used to provide the primary means of access to abutting properties and protection from through traffic. Marginal Access Local Streets should be located parallel to and adjacent to an Arterial Street. 
v.  Private Street 
Private Streets are Local Streets that may be allowed in planned unit developments (PUDs) or the ETJ with homeowners' associations that maintain them. Unless otherwise approved through the PUD zoning process, Private Streets shall meet the minimum right-of-way and pavement widths and all other city construction standards for Type A Local Street and Type B Local Street, unless otherwise approved through the PUD zoning process, consistent with the location and nature of the subdivision and subject to approval by the Director of Development Services. The Director of Development Services may refer such approvals for private streets to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
vi.  PUD Local Street 
Street widths narrower than public Local Street standards may be allowed through the PUD zoning process in the zoning ordinance if adequate off-street parking is provided and emergency access is ensured to the satisfaction of the director. The PUD zoning option is not available in the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ). 
vii.  Type RR Local Street 
Similar in nature to the Type A Local Street, this type of street is associated only with the Rural Residential zoning district and shall be used for primary and secondary access to single family detached residential units, where excessive through traffic is not anticipated

3.  Visitor Entrance Design Standards 
At least one entrance to a subdivision with Private Streets shall be equipped for visitor access. In addition to meeting the above design standards, the visitor entrance shall be equipped with a call or code box located at least 50 feet from the boundary of the subdivision to provide for visitors calling in and automobile queuing. A turn-around space with a minimum outside radius of 30 feet shall be located between any call or code box and the access control device to allow vehicles denied access to safely exit onto public streets in a "headout" position.

6.14. - Residential Thoroughfare Screening 
A.  Purpose Statement 
The image of the City and its related influence on property values and the types of development that occur directly affect the public welfare of the City. With streets being the largest public land use, the image people experience when traveling City streets can have a substantial impact on the overall image of the City. This section (Section 6.14 Residential Thoroughfare Screening) is designed to create a positive visual image from City streets by providing quality screening options using landscaping, masonry, or fence materials. In addition to improving the City's image, these landscape screening options are intended to buffer residential uses from roadway noise to minimize sound and visual nuisances of roadway adjacency. 
B.  Required Screening 
Screening is required for all single-family detached, two-family, and townhome lots and subdivisions as follows: 
1.  Back of Lots 
The rear of all lots that back to an Arterial Street or Collector Street; and 
2.  Side of Lots 
The side of all lots that side to an Arterial Street or Collector Street. 
C.  Screening Plan 
1.  Preliminary Screening Plan 
A Preliminary Screening Plan shall be submitted for review and approval with the Preliminary Plat. 
2.  Final Screening Plan 
a.  A Final Screening Plan, including entry features and showing all elevations and materials, shall be submitted with the Construction Plans. 
b.  The Screening Plan shall be reviewed and considered for approval by the Director of Development Services prior to approval of the Construction Plans, and prior to scheduling a Pre-Construction Meeting (see Section 5.02 Pre-Construction Meeting). 
3.  City Design Standards 
a.  Screening walls and fences shall be designed in accordance with the City's codes. 
b.  Structural elements shall be sealed by a licensed professional engineer and approved by the City. 
4.  Timing of Installation and Inspection 
The timing and inspection of all required screening shall comply with Section 5.06 Inspection, Maintenance, and Acceptance of Public Improvements. 
D.  Screening Standards 
Required screening shall be construction in accordance with one of the following methods. 
1.  A solid masonry wall at least six (6) feet but not greater than eight (8) feet in height. 
2.  Cement fiberboard materials (commonly referred to as HardiePlank), may be used as masonry materials for screening.  
6.15. - Park Land Dedication 
A.  Purpose 
1.  The purpose of this section is to provide recreational areas and amenities in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of Subdivision development in the City. This section is derived from the ordinance enacted in accordance with the Home Rule powers of the City, granted under the Texas Constitution and statutes of the State of Texas including, without limitation, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 51.071 et seq. and 212.001 et seq. 
2.  It is hereby declared by the City Council that recreational areas, in the form of neighborhood parks and related amenities and improvements, are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide for the same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property of a residential Subdivision in the City, whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential areas. 
3.  Neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby, the standards for which are set forth in the latest Comprehensive Plan, as amended. The neighborhood parks shown within the zones on the map of the City, which is on file with the City, based upon the official latest Comprehensive Plan, as amended, shall be prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from the majority of residences to be served thereby within such zone. The cost of the neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks within such zones, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, the requirements listed in Subsection 6.15.D (Park Land Requirements) of this section are adopted to attain such purposes. 
4.  The dedications of land and fees collected from within the various Park Service Zones shall be utilized to create neighborhood parks within such Park Service Zone. 
B.  Process Overview 
Before a Plat Application may be submitted for review, the Developer shall gain the City Council's approval of the dedication required by this section. The prerequisite of the City Council's approval of the dedication before the submittal of a Plat Application is required because the City Council is not a part of the general platting approval process. Therefore, the only opportunity for the City Council to approve a park land dedication that best meets the community's vision is before a Plat Application is submitted. 
C.  Park Land Dedication Submittal Application and Approval 
1.  The Director of Development Services shall establish the Application Form and requirements (e.g., the size of map, the information to be shown, etc.) for the park land dedication Application and review the Application. The City Council shall have the authority to approve park land dedications. At the City Council's discretion, it may request a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission regarding the dedication requirement. 
2.  Proposed land dedications shall be presented as part of the Application. 
3.  The City Council may accept or reject the land offered by the Developer and require any dedication within Section 6.15.D (below). Some issues for consideration by the City may include: 
a.  Land is unusable or not compatible with the Comprehensive Plan. 
b.  Sufficient park area is already dedicated in the development area. 
c.  The area would be better served by expanding or improving existing parks. 
d.  Acquisition of the land is not in the best interest of the City. 
4.  Once the City Council has approved a dedication, a developer may submit a Plat Application. All subsequently related Plat Application shall conform to the City Council's approval. 
D.  Park Land Requirements 
1.  General requirements; dedication of land and payment of park development fee. 
a.  Dedication of Land or Payment in Lieu Required 
i.  Prior to a Plat being filed with the County, for a development of a residential area within the City and in accordance with the planning and zoning ordinances of the City, such Plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of one (1) acre of land for each 133 proposed dwelling units. In the event a Plat is not required, the dedication of land required under this section shall be met prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
ii.  Any proposed Plat submitted to the City for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section. The required land dedication of this section may be met by a payment in lieu of land where permitted by the City or required by other provisions in this section. 
iii.  The City Council declares that development of an area of less than five (5) acres for neighborhood park purposes is impractical. Therefore, if fewer than 665 dwelling units are proposed by a Plat filed for approval, the City Council may require the developer to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount, as provided in Subsection 6.15.D.2 (Cash in Lieu of Land) of this section. 
b.  Park Development Fee Required 
i.  In addition to the required dedication of land as set forth in Subsections 6.15.D.1.a.i and 6.15.D.1.a.ii of this section, there shall also be a park development fee paid to the City as a condition to subdivision Plat approval. Such park development fee shall be set from time to time by ordinance of the City Council sufficient to provide for the development of amenities and improvements on undeveloped park land within the relevant zone at the then current costs as determined by the City Council, to meet the standards for a neighborhood park to serve the area in which the subdivision is located. The fee may vary from Park Service Zone to Park Service Zone, and may be set below actual development costs. Unless and until changed by an ordinance amendment of the City Council, the park development fee shall be calculated on the basis of $300.00 per dwelling unit. 
ii.  In lieu of payment of the required park development fee, a Developer shall have the option to construct the neighborhood park amenities and improvements. All plans and specifications for the construction of such amenities and improvements must be reviewed and approved by the City. The developer shall financially guarantee the construction of the amenities and improvements, and the City must approve the same, prior to the filing of a Plat in the case of platted subdivisions. Once the amenities and improvements are constructed, and after the City has accepted such amenities and improvements, the developer shall dedicate, by Plat, such amenities and improvements to the City. 
c.  Land Considerations 
i.  In instances where land is required to be dedicated, the City shall have the right to accept or reject the dedication and to require a cash payment in lieu of land, in the amount provided under subsection 6.15.D.2 (Cash in Lieu of Land) of this section, if the City determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain for the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential for that area would be better served by expanding or improving existing neighborhood parks. 
ii.  When two or more developments will be necessary to create a neighborhood park of sufficient size in the same area, the Planning and Zoning Commission, with final approval by the City Council at the time of Preliminary Plat approval, will work with the developers to define the optimum location of the required dedication within the respective Plats. Once a park site has been determined, adjacent property owners who develop around the park site shall dedicate land and cash to the existing site unless otherwise determined by the City Council, and shall take the existence of such park into consideration in the design of its site with respect to access to the park, sidewalks and the like. This provision is applicable even if the adjacent property is not in the Park Service Zone for that park. 
iii.  In the event the City determines that the area of proposed development or construction contains a location that is desirable for a neighborhood park, but the required land dedication for such proposed development or construction is not sufficient to provide the land necessary, the following provisions will apply: 
(a)  The Developer shall negotiate in good faith with the City to sell the additional land to the City. Approval of the subdivision Plat or building permit, as the case may be, may be delayed by the City for up to 275 calendar days past the time for approval set forth in the City's Zoning Ordinance to accommodate such negotiation. 
(b)  As part of such negotiated price for the land, the City will be permitted to offer any or all of the following to the Developer: 
(i)  Double credit for both land dedication and park development fees; 
(ii)  Consideration of developer/owner's desires with respect to the type of park development or amenities planned for the park; 
(iii)  Alteration of open space requirements for the subdivision or development; 
(iv)  Offset against any other capital improvements required by City ordinance for the development; 
(v)  Commitment on the part of the City to develop the park within a specified period of time; or 
(vi)  Any other reasonable concession by the City with respect to its development ordinances. 
iv.  In the event condemnation is necessary, such incentives (above) shall not apply. 
2.  Cash in Lieu of Land 
a.  A Developer responsible for land dedication under this section may be required, at the City Council's option, to meet the dedication requirements in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land, in the amount set forth in Subsection 6.15.D.2.b. Such payment in lieu of land shall be made prior to filing the Final Plat for record, or prior to the issuance of a building permit where a Plat is not required. 
b.  The cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall be met by the payment of a fee set from time to time by ordinance of the City Council sufficient to acquire neighborhood parkland or to expand or improve existing neighborhood parks within the relevant zone. Unless and until changed by the City Council, such fee shall be computed on the basis of $200.00 per dwelling unit. The City Council may review the fee from time to time, and the new fee established shall be based upon its determination of land costs in the respective Park Service Zones, for fees pertaining to each zone, or in the City generally and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, if the fee is uniform throughout the City. The fee may vary from zone to zone, and may be set below the actual costs determined. 
c.  A cash payment in lieu of land dedication, as set forth in Subsection 6.15.D.2.b, does not relieve the Developer of its obligation to pay the park development fee set forth in Subsection 6.15.D.1.b.i. The cash payment in lieu of land dedication is in addition to the required park development fee. 
d.  The City may from time to time decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development. If the City does purchase park land in a park service area, subsequent park land dedications for that zone may be in cash only, the calculation of which is set forth in Subsection 6.15.D.2.b. Such cash payment is in addition to the payment of the required park development fee. 
3.  Special Fund; Right to Refund 
a.  All funds collected by this dedication process will be deposited in the City's Park Development Fund. The funds for each Park Service Zone are used solely for the purchase or leasing of parkland and the development of the same within the relevant zones. Such funds may be commingled for administrative purposes. All expenditures from the Fund will be reviewed and approved by the City Council. 
b.  The City shall account for all sums paid into the Park Development Fund with reference to the individual Plats involved. Any monies paid into the Fund must be expended by the City within ten years from the date received by the City. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis in a particular Park Service Zone. If not so expended within the ten-year period, the then owners of the property within such zone, or the then owners of property contributing to such fund, will, on the last day of such period, be entitled to a refund of the remaining fees. The current owners of the property within the Subdivision must request such a refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right is waived. 
4.  Additional Requirements 
a.  Any land dedicated to the City under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses. The following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable: 
i.  Any area primarily located in the 100-year floodplain. 
ii.  Any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders the same unusable for organized recreational activities. 
The above characteristics of a park land dedication area may be grounds for refusal of any Plat. 
b.  Drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the channel is to remain more or less in its natural state or constructed in accordance with City engineering standards, if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel, and if not less than five acres of the site is above the 100-year floodplain, or if the dedication is in excess of ten acres, not more than 50 percent of the site is to be included in the 100-year floodplain. 
c.  Each park must have ready access to a public street. 
d.  Unless provided otherwise in this section, an action by the City shall be by the City Council. 
e.  Properties within any Preliminary Plat approved prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, or building permit issued, as applicable, shall be exempt from the requirements set forth in this section; however, when such preliminary approval expires, any resubmission of such plat shall meet the requirements of this section. 
E.  Waiver of Dedication Requirements for Affordable HousingApartmentsMulti-family Residential. Park land dedication requirements, both dedication of land and payment of the development fee, are waived for any unit of rental housing within an apartment developmentmulti-family residential which qualifies as Affordable Housing under 42 U.S. Code Section 12745 (a), and for which Federal Tax Credits have been granted, under the following conditions: 
1.  An application for such waiver shall be filed with the City Development Department on forms promulgated by the Director of Development. 
2.  Proof that the housing units qualify for rental under 42 U.S. Code Section 12745 (a), and that the Federal Tax credits for the same have been granted for the specific number of qualifying units must be submitted along with the application. 
3.  The units must continue to qualify for rental under said U.S. Code section for thirty years, and the City shall file a statement to such affect in the Deed Records of Gillespie County, Texas. In the event the units are not so maintained for the thirty year period, the City will be paid for the fees waived, and the then owner of the property shall be responsible therefor, and the same shall constitute a lien against the property for which the waivers were granted. The Director will apply the cash in lieu of dedication of land criteria and the park development fee in effect at the time of the application to determine the amount of fees waived for each qualifying unit for which a fee is waived. 
4.  With regard to an apartment development containing both qualifying and non-qualifying units, the waiver of dedication and fees will be determined on a percentage basis which the fee for the number of qualifying units bears to the total fee which would be payable if there were no qualifying units. The Director will fairly determine this percentage in the event park land is dedicated for the non-qualifying units. 
F.  Park Land Dedication Requirements. Both dedication of land and payment of the development fee are waived for any unit of owner-occupied housing, or rental housing below, which qualifies as Workforce Housing under the following conditions: 
1.  An application for such waiver shall be filed with the City Development Department on forms promulgated by the Director of Development. 
2.  Proof that the housing units qualify as Workforce Housing must be submitted along with the application. Workforce Housing for the purposes hereof are: 
a.  Houses, which include townhouses and condominiums, which are sold or rented to persons who will occupy the house as his, her or their primary residence the total sales price of which is no more than ninety percent (90%) of the mean home price for home sales within the City of Fredericksburg for the year previous to that of the year of the sale. The mean home price will be that established by the Gillespie County Board of Realtors or if the same is unavailable, the Director of Development will use a comparable method to establish the mean home price. 
b.  Houses, which include townhouses and condominiums, which are financed to the borrower, if financed, must meet FHA financing guidelines with regard to interest rates, costs of the loan, closing costs and all other fees to the borrower. 
3.  That the sale occur on or before June 30, 2016.

(b)  There are five Drought Response Stages for the City of Fredericksburg: 
Stage 1 - Mild Water Shortage 
Stage 2 - Moderate Water Shortage 
Stage 3 - Severe Water Shortage 
Stage 4 - Critical Water Shortage 
Stage 5 - Emergency Water Shortage 
Each stage will be triggered and terminated based upon the City Manager's evaluation of the severity of three criteria: 1) on the Local Drought Index, 2) on high service pumping capacity for pumps that transfer water from the City's well fields or other sources to its distribution system and 3) on the decrease in well field production capacity. 
Various stages are triggered based on the stage of the Local Drought Index, the percentage of time the well fields are being pumped to provide water supply and the loss of pumping capacity from the high service pump stations. The Local Drought Index is comprised of four data points: 1) the average water levels from the two City wells where heaviest pumpage occurs for municipal and irrigation demands, 2) average daily flow from the Pedernales River measured from a consistent designated gauging station, 3) the prior ten-month cumulative rainfall amounts recorded by the City at Lady Bird Johnson Park, and 4) the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index for the Edwards Plateau. The Index values, and generally corresponding, Drought Response Stages are: 
Local Drought Index 	Drought Stage 
-1 	Stage 1  Mild 
-2 	Stage 2  Moderate 
-3 	Stage 3  Severe 
-4 	Stage 4  Critical

Additional Special Site and Development Regulations: 
1.  All Entry Corridor Standards and Guidelines shall apply to development within the MU-1 District, with the following modifications: 
a.  New designs shall be compatible with the design traditions of the established neighborhoods and regional Texas Hill Country aesthetic. It is not the intent of these guidelines to require that new buildings copy older building styles. Therefore, use traditional building forms and broader similarities of design in order to be compatible with existing buildings in the area that reflect the traditional context. 
b.  If a shed roof or flat roof design is used, a parapet wall shall be added to screen the roof. 
c.  When making transitions to lower density areas, modulate the mass of the building to relate to smaller buildings. 
d.  Faux windows and similar details are not appropriate articulation. 
e.  Signs shall integrate into building and site design so they do not appear as an afterthought. 
f.  Attached signs shall be located above the building entrance, storefront opening, or at other locations that are compatible with the architectural features of the building. 
g.  The front door shall connect to the sidewalk along the entry corridor. 
h.  Light fixture style and location shall be compatible with the building's architecture, site design and landscape design. Decorative fixtures are highly recommended and where warranted, may be required. Light fixture style shall be consistent throughout the project. 
i.  Light fixtures shall be located facing away from adjacent sites (particularly residential parcels) so that the light does not spill-over onto abutting properties. Parking and building light fixtures shall be cut-off luminaries that have less than 90 degree cut-off so that the light is not emitted horizontally or upward. 
j.  All roof-top equipment shall be screened from entry corridors, side streets, plazas and parks. 
k.  Parking shall be located behind buildings or on the side. Parking in front of buildings may be permitted, subject to a Conditional Use Permit as provided for in section 5.400. 
2.  Shared access for pedestrians and vehicles shall be provided between properties and uses. 
3.  Pedestrian circulation will be given priority over vehicular access.

7.  Residential density for townhomes, condominiums and multi-family dwellings may be increased by 25 percent if utilized above the ground floor level and combined with other permitted uses. 
8.  Outdoor storage shall be prohibited.

Sec. 3.810. - MU-2: MIXED USE - CORRIDOR. 
Intent 
This zone represents an effort to change the typical pattern of strips of underperforming commercial development that often line highways and arterials. Rather than limiting the properties along major entry corridors to commercial uses, this category offers a variety of higher density residential and mixed use opportunities. The policy of allowing this mix of uses along major roadways supports a change in development from a pattern of older commercial structures to new projects with a variety of uses, including mixed use within an individual building project or building.

Sec. 5.481. - Suspension and Revocation. 
Upon violation of any applicable provision of this ordinance or, if granted subject to conditions, upon failure to comply with conditions, a Conditional Use Permit shall be suspended after thirty (30) days written notification to the owner of a use or property subject to a Conditional Use Permit. 
Discontinuance. A conditional use permit is automatically terminated upon a change in use, upon discontinuance, being defined as non-operation or non-use for 365 successive days. Discontinuance may be, but not required to be, evidenced by termination of utility service, the failure to maintain regular hours of operation, the utilization of the premises for other purposes, abandonment or by other reasonable means. 
Upon failure to start construction or establish a use within two (2) years of approval of a conditional use permit.  
Sec. 5.490. - Prior Special Permits and Covenants. 
A use legally established pursuant to a Specific Use Permit prior to the date of adoption of these Zoning Regulations shall be deemed a pre-existing conditional use and shall be permitted to continue, provided that it is operated and maintained in accord with any conditions prescribed at the time of its establishment. 
Alteration or expansion of a pre-existing specific use shall be permitted only upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit as prescribed in these regulations, provided that alterations not exceeding $2,500 in value as determined by the Director of Planning and Building, shall be without the granting of a Conditional Use Permit.

Sec. 5.500. - BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. 
The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers: 
Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the Zoning Property Development Regulations and Sign Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provision of the Zoning Regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the Zoning Regulations shall be observed and substantial justice done.

Sec. 5.600. - VARIANCE PROCEDURE. 
This procedure is intended to provide relief from the terms of the Zoning Property Development Regulations and Sign Ordinance when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, the strict application of the Zoning Property Development Regulations and Sign Ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification, and to ensure that any adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and the district in which such property is situated.

Existing and proposed parking, loading and traffic and pedestrian circulation features, both on the site and any off-site facilities or improvements related to or necessitated by the proposed use. 
The Director of Planning and Building may request additional information necessary to enable a complete analysis and evaluation of the variance request, and a determination as to whether the circumstances prescribed for the granting of a Variance exist. 
The application shall be accompanied by a fee established by the City Council. A single application may include requests for Variances for more than one regulation applicable to the same site, or for similar Variances on two or more adjacent parcels with similar characteristics.  
Sec. 5.620. - Report of the Director of Planning and Building.

Sec. 5.640. - Action by the Board of Adjustment. 
The Board of Adjustment shall act upon the application not more than twenty (20) days following the close of the public hearing on a Variance.

The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to grant a Variance.  
Sec. 5.650. - Findings. 
Basic Criteria. The Board of Adjustment may grant a Variance if it makes affirmative findings of fact on each of the following criteria: 
The Zoning Regulations applicable to the property do not allow for a reasonable use. 
The plight of the owner of the property is due to unique circumstances existing on the property, and the unique circumstances were not created by the owner of the property and are not merely financial, and are not due to or the result of general conditions in the zoning district in which the property is located. 
The variance will not alter the character of the area adjacent to the property, will not impair the use of adjacent conforming property and will not impair the purposes or regulations to the Zoning District in which the property is located. 
Parking: Additional Criteria. The City Council may grant a Variance to a regulation prescribed by this ordinance with respect to the number of off-street spaces or loading facilities required if it makes findings of fact that the following additional criteria are also satisfied: 
Neither present nor anticipated future traffic volumes generated by the use of the site or the uses of sites in the vicinity reasonably require strict or literal interpretations and enforcement of the specific regulation. 
The granting of the Variance will not result in the parking or loading of vehicles on public streets in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of traffic of the streets. 
The granting of the Variance will not create a safety hazard or any other condition inconsistent with the objectives of this ordinance. 
The Variance shall run with the use or uses to which it pertains, and shall not run with the site.  
Sec. 5.652. - Signs: Additional Criteria. 
The Board may grant a variance to a regulation prescribed by the Sign Ordinance with respect to the placement of signs, the height of signs or the area of signs if it affirmatively finds each of the following: 
That a sign is being replaced. For the purposes of this Section, replacement shall include the erection of a new or different sign due to the removal of another sign for any reason, including the change of name of a business whether from change of ownership, business being conducted, or otherwise, the change of a sign for a continuing business containing the same or different information as the sign being replaced, and the replacement of signs due to damage or vandalism. 
That all structures on the property for which the sign is proposed that would impede the replacement of a sign were constructed prior to February 17, 1986. 
That it is impractical to abide by existing placement, height or area regulations due to the placement, size of construction of existing structures in relationship to the physical characteristics of the site. For purposes of illustration, physical characteristics may include topography of the site or surrounding sites, structures on surrounding sites, traffic conditions, street layouts and existing natural vegetation. 
That the other types of signs which are permitted by this Ordinance cannot practically be used. In making this determination of practicality, the Board may consider 
The undesirability of altering a historic site to accommodate a sign which would be permitted with no variance under this Ordinance; or 
That alternatives permitted by this Ordinance would involve extensive reconstruction of structures; or 
That alternatives permitted by this Ordinance are prohibitively expensive; or 
That alternatives permitted by this Ordinance will not effectively identify the subject of the sign. 
That the proposed sign has been reviewed by the Historic Review Board if applicable. 
That the proposed variance is as close to the requirements of the sign ordinance as is feasible.  
Sec. 5.660. - Effective Date of Variance. 
A decision of the Board of Adjustment on a Variance shall be effective immediately.  
Sec. 5.670. - Lapse of Variance.

A Variance subject to lapse may be renewed by the Board for an additional period of one year, provided that prior to the expiration date, a written request for renewal is filed with Board. 
The Board may grant or deny any application for renewal.  
Sec. 5.671. - Suspension and Revocation. 
Upon violation of any applicable provision of this ordinance, or, if granted subject to conditions, a Variance shall be suspended after thirty (30) days written notification to the owner of the use or property to the Variance.  
Sec. 5.680. - Variance to Run With Land or Structure.

Sec. 5.690. - Variance Appeal Procedure. 
Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department or board of the City may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board of Adjustment.  
Sec. 5.700. - ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCEDURES.

Sec. 6.110. - Continuance of a Nonconforming Use. 
Residential Districts 
Enlargement. A non-conforming use shall not be enlarged, expanded, extended or changed. 
Conversions. A non-conforming use may be continued as the same classification, or may be changed to a use of a more restricted classification upon approval of a conditional use permit. If it is changed to a use in a more restricted classification or to a conforming use, it cannot be changed back to its original non-conforming use. For purpose of this paragraph, the phrase "same classification" means: uses permitted in the same district; a "more restricted classification" means: use in a district having more restricted use (i.e., C-2 vs. C-1); and provided that: 
The new use is similar to or less intensive than that of the old use in terms of noise generated, outdoor storage, customer activity and impact on other conforming uses in the area, and that the new use comply with the parking requirements of this ordinance as applicable to newly established uses. 
Termination. 
If a non-conforming use or any portion thereof is voluntarily discontinued for a period of 90 days, any future use of such land or portion thereof shall be in conformity with the regulations of the district in which such land or portion thereof is located. 
Non-conforming use is terminated upon a change in use other than as provided herein. 
Non-conforming use is terminated upon destruction of a structure occupied by a non-conforming use unless it is permitted to be rebuilt as provided herein. 
Other Districts 
Enlargement. A non-conforming use may be enlarged within the boundary of the lot in which the non-conforming use has legally operated upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit (section 5.400). 
Provided, however, a Conditional Use Permit shall not be required, and the enlargement may occur, upon submission and approval of a Site Plan if the enlargement involves only a one-time increase in the size of the building in which the same use is operated of not more than 25 percent. 
Any enlargement or extension, whether requiring a Conditional Use Permit or not, shall be required to come into in compliance with all city ordinances, codes, or policies and development regulations which may apply to the property (examples without limitation: landscape, parking, curb cuts, setbacks), and the non-conforming use may be continued only for so long as the property remains in compliance with all applicable City Ordinances and Codes, including those prohibiting nuisances. All Existing non-conforming single family residential uses may be enlarged without the necessity of obtaining a Conditional Use Permit. 
Conversions. A non-conforming use may be continued as the same classification, or may be changed to a use of a more restricted classification upon approval of a conditional use permit. If it is changed to a use in a more restricted classification or to a conforming use, it cannot be changed back to its original non-conforming use. For purpose of this paragraph, the phrase "same classification" means: uses permitted in the same district; a "more restricted classification" means: use in a district having more restricted use (i.e., C-2 vs. C-1); and provided that: 
The new use is similar to or less intensive than that of the old use in terms of noise generated, outdoor storage, customer activity and impact on other conforming uses in the area. 
The new use complies with the parking requirements of this ordinance as applicable to newly established uses. 
Termination. A nonconforming use is terminated under the following conditions: 
Upon a change in use other than as provided herein. 
Upon discontinuance, being defined as non-operative or non use for a period of at least 365 successive days. Discontinuance may be, but is not required to be, evidenced by termination of utility service, the failure to maintain regular hours of operation, the utilization of the premises for other purposes, abandonment or by any other reasonable means. 
Upon destruction of a structure occupied by a nonconforming use except if it is permitted to be rebuilt as provided herein. 
Replacement. If a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire, the elements or other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. In the case of partial destruction of a nonconforming use not exceeding 75 percent of its tax roll assessed value, reconstruction will be permitted but the size or function of the nonconforming use shall not be expanded. 
(Ord. No. 23-007, 5-20-2013; Ord. No. 24-024, 12-1-2014)  
Sec. 6.120. - Continuance of Nonconforming Structures. 
Subject to all limitations herein set forth, any nonconforming structure may be occupied and operated and maintained in a state of good repair, but no nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or extended. 
A nonconforming structure in which only permitted uses are operated may be enlarged or extended if the enlargement or extension can be made in compliance with all the provisions of this chapter established for structures in the district in which the nonconforming structure is located. Such enlargement shall also be subject to all other applicable city ordinances. 
Termination of nonconforming structures: 
Damage to structures. The right to operate and maintain any nonconforming structure shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the nonconforming structure is damaged in any manner and from any cause whatsoever and the cost of repairing such damage exceeds 75 percent of the tax roll assessed value of such structure on the date of such damage. 
Obsolescence of structure.

Sec. 7.400. - MEASURE OF DISTANCES GENERALLY. 
Distances between structures, or between a structure and any property line, setback line, or other line or location prescribed by the Zoning Regulations shall be measured to the exterior face of the nearest wall or vertical support of the structure. Where a structure does not have a vertical wall or support, the point of measurement shall be as determined by the Director of Planning and Building, consistent with the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and the provisions of the Building Code.  
Sec. 7.500. - HEIGHT REGULATIONS. 
Height limitations are established to ensure that buildings and structures shall not exceed heights generally compatible with purposes of the district and other uses therein, and shall not unnecessarily impact upon the privacy, views, or desirability of development of adjoining sites.  
Sec. 7.510. - Measurements of Height. 
Building. The height of a building shall be measured from the average of the highest and lowest grade adjacent to the building, to the highest point of the coping of a flat roof, deck line of a mansard roof, or to the height of the highest gable on a pitched or hipped roof. 
Building Segment. The height of buildings having visually distinct segments, such as stepped or terrace construction or building segments connected by lower portions of the structure, shall be measured separately for each segment of the building. 
Linear Structures and Features. The height of linear features, such as fences, wall, hedges, screen plantings or line features shall be the average height measured from grade to the highest portion of such feature at all points along the feature. For purposes of applying maximum or minimum requirements, a linear feature which has an average height for its entire length in conformity with such requirements and does not exceed the requirement by more than fifteen percent (15%) at any point shall be deemed to comply.  
Sec. 7.520. - Permitted Exceptions to Height Limits. 
The following structures and features may exceed the maximum height for the district in which they are located, subject to limits specified herein: 
The following structures may exceed the height limit of any district by not more than fifteen percent (15%), or such height as may be necessary to comply with generally accepted engineering practices for stacks and vents, or any applicable Federal or State law, regulation, guideline or order, whichever is greater: 
Parapet walls, chimneys, vents and mechanical or safety features such as fire towers, stairways, elevator penthouses, heating and cooling equipment and protective covers.

Sec. 7.530. - Fences, Walls and Visibility. 
All fences, walls, shrubs, trees, signs or other obstructions shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
(a)  All fences, walls, and hedges, located in front of the minimum required front yard line as specified herein, shall not be constructed or maintained to a height exceeding four (4) feet above the grade of the lot. 
(b)  All fences and walls located to the rear of the minimum required front yard setback shall not exceed eight feet in height. Fences or walls which conform to the minimum front, side and rear yards for buildings may be erected to any maximum height specified for a building on the lot or tract where such fence or wall is located 
(c)  In addition to the provisions of (a) and (b) above, the following will apply to corner lots. 
No fence, wall, shrub, tree, sign or other obstruction shall encroach into the area hereinafter defined as the twenty-five (25) foot visibility triangle. The limbs and foliage of trees existing as of April 1, 2009, may remain if an unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between three (3) feet and seven (7) feet in height from the road surface allowing for a four (4) foot visual clearance is maintained. 
The twenty-five (25) foot visibility triangle is derived by measuring back twenty-five (25) feet along the curb (or edge of paved street if there is no curb) from the street corner of both streets, or other rights of way, that forms the point of intersection of the projection of the curb lines (or street paving if there is no curb) from the property. When both distances are measured, they will create two sides of the triangle. Then both sides of the triangle shall be connected by a line between both measured points. This completes the third side of the triangle and gives a line of angle to follow. All fences, walls, shrubs, trees, signs or other obstructions shall be located behind the measured triangle. 
All fences, walls, shrubs, trees, signs or other obstructions shall be located behind the measured triangle. Only grass and/or groundcover will be permitted inside the triangle. 
 
A.  Front yard set back is determined by the recorded lot orientation, not by address or orientation of structure. 
B.  Maximum height for the front yard fence is [four feet] (4'). This includes any gates, arbors, entrances or other structures built into the fence. 
C.  Maximum fence height other than the front yard is eight [feet] (8'). 
D.  Fences and landscaping on corner lots must adhere to the Twenty-five[-foot] (25') triangle requirement. As shown above, a fence shall be built on an angle. There shall not be any landscaping within the triangle area, other than ground cover and/or grass. 
(d)  Vegetation on or within the Right-of Way, overhanging the paved street area, shall be maintained at a vertical clearance of fourteen (14) feet.

(Ord. No. 18-014, § 7.610, 12-1-2008)  
Sec. 7.700. - LOT COVERAGE REGULATIONS. 
Lot coverage limitations are established to ensure that building coverage and impervious surface coverage of each lot are compatible with the nature of uses allowable in each district, with environmental objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, and to avoid overcrowding of sites with buildings and paved or impermeable surface materials.  
Sec. 7.710. - Measurement. 
Building coverage of a lot shall be deemed the total horizontal area of all buildings and roofed or covered spaces on the lot, expressed as a percent to total lot area. Eaves and roof overhangs extending not more than three (3) feet from the supporting walls or members of a building shall not be counted as building coverage.

Development regulations and design standards are intended to ensure the usefulness of parking facilities, protect the public safety and, where appropriate, to mitigate potential adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.  
Sec. 7.820. - Basic Regulations: Vehicle Parking/Loading & Unloading. 
Off-street parking facilities shall be provided for any new building constructed for any new use established. Off-street parking facilities shall be provided for any addition or enlargement of an existing building or use, and for any change of occupancy or manner of operation that would result in additional parking spaces being required, provided that the additional parking shall be required only for such addition, enlargement, or change and not for the entire building or use. 
Facilities being used for off-street parking on the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance shall not be reduced in capacity to less than the number of spaces prescribed, nor altered in design or function to less than the minimum standards prescribed in the Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations. 
For sites with more than one use and for adjacent sites served by a common parking facility, the parking requirement shall be the total number of spaces required for each site or use, except as adjusted pursuant to Section 7.850. 
Parking facilities constructed or substantially reconstructed subsequent to the effective date of the Zoning Regulations, whether or not required, shall conform to the design Standards set forth in Section 7.860. 
All required facilities shall be maintained for the duration of the use requiring such areas. Such facilities shall be used exclusively for the temporary parking of passenger automobiles, motor vehicles, or light trucks not exceeding one ton in capacity, and shall not be used for the sale, display, or storage of merchandise, or for the storage or repair of vehicles or equipment. 
All required parking facilities shall be located on the same site as the use for which such facilities are required, except as authorized pursuant to Section 7.850. 
No use shall be required to provide more spaces than prescribed by these regulations or prescribed by the Director of Planning and Building in accordance with these Zoning Regulations, or prescribed pursuant to a Conditional Use Permit or a Variance. Where parking spaces are provided in excess of such requirements, the spaces may be considered as meeting the requirement for another use pursuant to Section 7.850. 
Head in parking which requires backing onto a public street, that is, parking which does not provide off-street space for turning a vehicle, is prohibited except in the R-2, R-3 and C-1 districts upon local streets only, provided that such parking does not exceed five (5) spaces and is located at least sixty (60) feet from any intersection of such local street and an arterial or collector street. Such parking shall be considered off-street parking. 
Uses or changes in use requiring three (3) or less off-street parking spaces in the CBD Zoning District shall be exempt from providing off-street parking. In the case of expansions of use, the normal parking requirements hereof will apply to the entire property, and the parking spaces exempted under this Subsection I as well as any additionally required ones will be provided at the time of expansion. 
Adequate loading and unloading facilities shall be provided onsite. Loading and unloading of commercial vehicles or customer vehicles on residential streets is prohibited. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Table 7.863, a minimum of five (5) parking spaces shall be provided for any single industrial use located individually on a site and served by a separate parking facility, and a minimum of ten (10) parking spaces shall be provided for any two or more industrial uses located on the same site and served by a common parking facility. 
There shall be no off-street parking requirement for any use occupying a historic structure as defined and listed site in the Fredericksburg Historic Resource Survey. Expansions and enlargements shall be subject to all provisions of Section 7.800.  
Sec. 7.825. - Special Provisions Applicable To Central Fredericksburg. 
A.  Special parking requirements shall apply within designated portions of Central Fredericksburg in order to further enhance the unique historical character and discourage inharmonious parking facilities in such historical districts or on sites occupied by historic structures and to reduce intrusion on pedestrian-oriented street frontages by parking facility access. 
B.  The Special parking requirements and provisions in this Section shall apply to all areas of blocks 15, 16, 21, 22, 27, 28, 33, 34, 42, 43, 47, 48, 52, 53, 57, 58, 67 and 68 of the Fredericksburg Addition, and which is further described as those blocks bordered by Austin Street, San Antonio Street, Elk Street and Bowie Street. 
C.  Special Provisions. 
1.  For those businesses which construct their own off-street, off-premises parking, the distance to the parking lot may be extended fifty percent (50%) in addition to the provisions in Section 7.850. 
2.  When any existing building is: (1) converted to another use; or (2) has the usable floor area within the existing building perimeter enlarged, rehabilitated or remodeled, without enlarging said building perimeter, then said building conversion or improvement shall not require additional off-street parking, other than the number of existing off-street parking spaces which are utilized by said building. 
3.  For new buildings or expanded building space, the following uses shall provide fifty percent (50%) of the off-street parking requirements of Table 7.863. 
4.  The provisions as provided herein shall not apply for sites where a historic structure is removed and a new building built. 
5.  The Special Parking Provisions shall not apply to properties utilized as Bed and Breakfasts, hotels, motels, or other lodgings. 
(Ord. No. 25-017, 9-21-2015; Ord. No. 2019-10, § 1, 4-15-2019)  
Sec. 7.830. - Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements. 
Parking facilities for each use shall be provided in accordance with the minimum requirements prescribed in Table 7.863. 
Where the application of Table 7.863 results in a fractional requirement, a fraction of 0.5 or greater shall be resolved to the higher whole number. 
For the purposes of this section, requirements shall be based on gross floor area, but shall not include enclosed or covered areas used for off-street parking or loading. 
Where requirements are established on the basis of seats or person capacity, the Standard Building Code provisions applicable at the time of determination shall be used to define capacity. 
Facilities requiring accessibility to the handicapped shall provide parking spaces as determined by the Standard Building Code.  
Sec. 7.840. - Parking for Compact Cars. 
In each parking facility of fifty (50) or more spaces, a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) and a maximum of forty percent (40%) of the spaces may be designed and reserved for small or compact cars. Spaces for compact vehicles shall be located in a manner affording desirability and usability equivalent to standard spaces. Compact parking spaces shall be located in groups of not less than five (5) contiguous spaces, and shall be identified by appropriate directions and marking.  
Sec. 7.850. - Off Site or Remote Parking. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve (by the Site Plan Review) location of a portion of the parking required for a use on another site, pursuant to this section. 
Off site parking shall be located within 300 feet of the use which it serves, measured as the shortest practical walking distance from the nearest off site parking space to the nearest entrance to the building or use which it serves. 
In determining whether to approve off site parking, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall consider all relevant factors, including: 
The location of the use and the proposed off site parking. 
Existing and potential parking demand created by other uses in the vicinity. 
The characteristics of the use, including employee and customer parking demand, hours of operation and projected convenience and frequency of use of the off site parking. 
Adequacy, convenience and safety of pedestrian access to off site parking. 
Traffic patterns on adjacent streets, and proposed access to the off site parking. 
The report and recommendation of the Director of Planning and Building and the Director of Public Works. 
The Commission may require such guarantees as it deems necessary to ensure the continued availability and usability of any off site parking. 
Handicapped parking spaces shall not be located in an off site parking facility.  
Sec. 7.860. - Design Standards. 
Standards. Design standards are established by this section to set basic minimum dimensions and guidelines for design construction, and maintenance of parking and loading facilities. 
Parking Space Dimensions. The following basic dimensions shall be observed for parking spaces. 
Each standard parking space shall consist of a rectangular area not less than 8.5 wide and 18.5 feet long. Each compact parking space shall consist of a rectangular area not less than 7.5 feet wide and 15.0 feet long. Each space shall have a vertical clearance of not less than 7.5 feet. Each space shall be independently accessible. 
Each parking space designated for use by the handicapped shall consist of a rectangular area not less than 12.5 feet wide and 18.5 feet long, shall have a vertical clearance not less than 7.5 feet, shall be located in an area not exceeding a two percent (2%) slope, and shall be located near and convenient to a level or ramp entrance accessible to handicapped persons. Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be signed and restricted for use by the handicapped only. 
Each parking space shall have adequate drives, aisles, and turning and maneuvering areas for access and usability, and shall at all times have access to a public street or alley. 
Parking Facility Design. Minimum parking facility design standards are illustrated in Table 7.862. Additional supplemental guidelines and standards for parking facility design, internal layout, acceptable turning radii and pavement slope, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and other design features may be adopted by resolution of the Planning and Zoning Commission, upon recommendation of the Director of Planning and Building. 
Paving and Drainage. The following basic standards shall be observed: 
In all districts parking and loading facilities shall be an all weather surface. Materials may be pervious (see Appendix D for impervious coverage requirements). All parking and loading facilities shall be appropriately marked with lines, buttons, or other approved markers. 
All parking facilities shall be graded and provided with permanent storm drainage facilities, meeting the construction specifications set by the City Engineer. Surfacing, curbing and drainage improvements shall be sufficient to preclude free flow of water onto adjacent properties or public streets or alleys and to provide adequate drainage. 
Curbing shall be provided along the parking facility area for all streets upon which it fronts. 
Safety Features. Parking facilities shall meet the following standards: 
Safety barriers, protective bumpers or curbing, and directional markers shall be provided to ensure safety, efficient utilization, protection of landscaping and prevention of encroachment onto adjoining public or private property. 
Visibility of and between pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists shall be ensured when entering individual parking spaces, when circulating within a parking facility and when entering and exiting a parking facility. 
Internal circulation patterns, and the location and traffic directions of all access drives, shall be designed, designated and maintained in accordance with accepted principles of traffic engineering and traffic safety. 
All ingress and egress shall be constructed in accordance with Section G, Access Standards. 
Lighting. Lights provided to illuminate any parking facility or paved area shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed to reflect away from any residential use. 
Access Standards. 
The width of a residential access from a public street to an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area shall not exceed twenty-one (21) feet. Exception: A residence with an attached three car garage may have up to thirty-one (31) feet. 
The width of a commercial, industrial, or civic use access, from a public street to an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area, shall not exceed forty (40) feet. 
No more than one access shall be permitted for any street frontage up to two hundred (200) lineal feet except that single family residential lots located in residential zoning districts are permitted two accesses provided the lot has a minimum of one hundred (100) feet of street frontage along the side of the lot which is to contain two accesses. Properties situated at the corner of two intersecting public streets shall provide a minimum corner clearance calculated as street frontage divided by five (5), but in no case less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
No more than two (2) accesses shall be permitted for any street frontage over two hundred (200) lineal feet but less than six hundred (600) lineal feet of street frontage. The distance between access or from the corner of two intersecting public streets shall provide a minimum separation as calculated by street frontage divided by five (5), but in no case more than one hundred (100) feet. 
Any frontage over six hundred (600) lineal feet is considered a special design requiring special engineering review and determinations, and more than two (2) accesses may be permitted only if deemed appropriate by the Planning and Zoning Commission (or the Director of Planning and Building if the development plan need not to be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission). 
Existing developed properties that do not have street curbs and street curbs are planned to be constructed, and a single driveway or two (2) driveways clearly exist (i.e.: each drive has a specific location and separate function) then the requirements as provided herein shall not apply. In no case shall there be more than two (2) accesses for frontage less than two hundred (200) feet. The second driveway shall be closed at the time of curbing if it imposes or creates a potential hazard to vehicular or pedestrian traffic as determined by the Director of Planning and Building. 
The above standards shall be applicable to any property constituting a separate tract or platted lot or which has or will be developed jointly or under one site plan. 
Refuse Collection and Storage. 
All businesses shall provide suitable trash and refuse storage areas which are designed and constructed to prevent view from the street and to prevent refuse from being displaced about the site, into adjacent properties or public right-of-way and to permit safe, easy removal of refuse by truck or hand.

Sec. 7.900. - LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING REGULATIONS. 
The purpose of landscaping and screening requirements is to improve certain set-back and yard areas, including off-street vehicular parking and open-lot sales and service areas, for all uses other than single-family, duplex, triplex or four-plex residential uses, and to aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, ground water recharge and storm water runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement, and to protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of surrounding neighborhoods.  
Sec. 7.910. - Specific Definitions. 
The following specific definitions shall apply to the landscaping and screening regulations contained in this Ordinance. 
Landscaping. Landscaping shall consist of any of the following or combination thereof: material such as, but not limited to grass, ground covers, shrubs, flowers, vines, hedges, trees, native plant materials, planters, brick, stone or natural forms, water forms, aggregate or other landscape features, but not including the use of smooth concrete or asphalt. The use of brick, stone, aggregate or other inorganic materials shall not predominate over the use of organic plant material. 
Shrubs. Self-supporting, woody species as normally grown in Gillespie county. 
Dripline. The periphery of the area beneath a tree that would be encompassed by perpendicular lines dropped from the furthermost edges of the crown of the tree.  
Sec. 7.920. - Landscaping Requirements. 
Landscaping requirements for certain yard areas and off-street parking, and other vehicular use areas (other than single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex residential uses) are as follows: 
a.  All areas used for the display or parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not (herein referred to as "off-street parking areas"), and all areas upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use (hereinafter referred to as "other vehicular use areas"), including, but not limited to, activities of a drive-in nature such as filling stations, grocery stores, banks and restaurants shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements herein provided. Exceptions include: (1) Areas used for parking or other vehicular uses under, on, or within buildings; (2) Parking areas and other vehicular use areas serving One-Family, Duplex, Triplex, or Fourplex uses as normally such residential areas are voluntary landscaped; and (3) Expansion and changes on the use of existing improved properties requiring an increase in off-street parking spaces and/or vehicle use area of less than twenty-five percent (25%) more than the number of off-street parking spaces existing at the time of the proposed expansion or change in use. 
b.  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in a good workmanship like manner and according to accepted good planting procedures with the quality of plant materials as herein described. All elements of landscaping, except plant material other than hedges, shall be installed so as to conform to all other applicable ordinances or City Codes. Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular encroachment as herein provided. Landscaping may be installed within the next planting season if the time of development is an inappropriate time to plant, but all landscaping must be installed no later than one year from date of occupancy of the property. 
c.  Maintenance. The owners, tenants and their agents, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping provided for under this ordinance. All landscaping shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. All landscaped areas shall be provided with either: (1) a readily available water supply with at least one outlet located within one hundred (100) feet of all plant material maintained; or (2) an underground sprinkler system. Landscaped areas adjacent to pavement areas shall be protected with curbs or equivalent barricades. 
d.  Plant Material. 
1.  Trees. Trees shall be species having an average mature spread of crown of at least (15) feet and having a trunk(s) which can be maintained in a clean condition over five (5) feet of clear wood. Trees having an average mature spread crown less than fifteen (15) feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a fifteen (15) foot crown spread. Tree species shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1½) inch diameter. 
2.  Shrubs and Hedges. Shrubs shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) inches in height when measured immediately after planting. Except as provided for herein, hedges shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, and solid visual screen within a reasonable time after planting. 
3.  Vines. Vines shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches in height immediately after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens, or walls to meet physical barrier requirements as herein specified. 
4.  Ground Covers. Ground covers used in lieu of grass in whole or in part shall be planted in such a manner as to present appearance and reasonably complete coverage within three (3) months after planting. 
5.  Lawn Grass. Grass areas shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns in Fredericksburg. Grass areas may be sodded, plugged, sprigged, or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. In areas where other than solid sod or grass seed is used, rye grass seed shall be sown for immediate effect and protection until further coverage is otherwise achieved. 
e.  Required Landscaping Adjacent to Public Right-of-Way. 
On the site of a building or open lot use providing an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area, where such area will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or structure from any abutting right-of-way, excluding dedicated alleys, there shall be provided landscaping between such area and such right-of-way, as follows: 
A strip of land at least five (5) feet in depth located between the abutting right-of-way and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area which is exposed to an abutting right-of-way shall be landscaped. Such landscaping shall include one tree for each fifty (50) lineal feet or fraction thereof of right-of-way (street) frontage. Such trees shall be located between the abutting right-of-way and off-street parking area or other vehicular use area and shall be planted in a planting area of at least twenty-five (25) square feet with each dimension at least (5) feet in length. In addition, a hedge, wall, or other durable landscape barrier of at least two (2) feet in height shall be placed along the perimeter of such landscaped strip. If such durable barrier is of non-living material, for each ten (10) feet thereof, one shrub or vine shall be planted abutting such barrier but need not be spaced ten (10) feet apart. Such shrubs or veins shall be planted along the street side of such barrier unless they are of sufficient height at the same time of planting to be readily visible over the top of such barrier. The remainder of the required landscaped areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape treatment, excluding paving. 
All property other than the required landscaped strip lying between the right-of-way and off-street parking area or other vehicular use area shall be landscaped with grass or other ground cover. 
Necessary access from the public right-of-way through all such landscaping shall be permitted to service the parking or other vehicular use areas. 
f.  Perimeter Landscaping Related to Abutting Properties. 
On the site of a building or structure or open lot use providing an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area, where such areas will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or structure from abutting property, that portion of such area not so screened shall be provided with a wall, fence, hedge or other durable landscape barrier not greater than eight (8) feet in height, nor less than three and one-half (3½) feet in height to form a continuous screen between the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area and such abutting property. Such landscape barrier shall be located between the common lot line and the off-street parking areas or other vehicular use areas are accomplished. 
If such barrier consists all or in part of plant materials, such plant materials shall be planted in a planting strip of not less than two and one-half (2½) feet in width. 
In addition, one tree shall be provided for each seventy-five (75) lineal feet of such landscape barrier or fractional part thereof. Such trees shall be located between the common lot line and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area. Each such tree shall be planted in at least twenty-five (25) square feet of planting area with each dimension at least five (5) feet in length. Each such planting area shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape material, excluding paving, in addition to the required tree. 
The provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable in the following situations: 
Where a property line abuts a dedicated alley, or to those portions of the property that are opposite a building or other structure, located on the abutting property. 
Where a proposed parking area or other vehicular use abuts an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier on an abutting property, said existing barrier may be used to satisfy the landscape barrier requirements of this subsection, provided that said existing barrier meets all applicable standards of this Ordinance and protection of hedges against vehicular encroachment is provided. 
Where the abutting property is zoned for business uses, only the tree provision with its planting area as prescribed in this subsection shall be required; however, the number of trees may be reduced to one (1) tree for each one hundred twenty-five (125) lineal feet or fractional part thereof. 
g.  Parking Area Interior Landscaping. 
Off-street parking areas shall have at least ten (10) square feet of interior landscaping for each parking space, excluding those spaces abutting a perimeter for which landscaping is required by other sections hereof and excluding all parking spaces which are directly served by an aisle abutting and running parallel to such a perimeter. In addition, other vehicular use areas shall have one (1) square foot of landscaped area for each one hundred (100) square feet or fraction thereof of paved area for the first 50,000 square feet, excluding the first 5,000 square feet of paved area, plus one (1) square foot of landscape area for each two hundred (200) square feet or fraction thereof of paved area for all paved area over 50,000 square feet; provided, however, in areas zoned for industrial use these requirements shall be reduced by 50%. 
Where the property contains both parking areas and other vehicular use areas, the two types of areas may be separated for the purposes of determining the other vehicular use first multiplying the total number of parking spaces by four hundred (400) and subtracting the resulting figure from the total square footage of the paved area. Each separate landscaped area shall contain a minimum of fifty (50) square feet, with each dimension at least five (5) feet in length, and shall include at least one (1) tree having a clear trunk at least five (5) feet in height, with the remaining area adequately landscaped with shrubs, ground cover or other authorized landscaping material not to exceed three (3) feet in height. 
The total number of trees shall not be less than one (1) for each one hundred (100) square feet or fraction (over one-half) thereof of required interior landscaped area. 
Such landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving. 
In other vehicular use areas where the strict application of this subsection will seriously limit the function of said area the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved area, including such perimeters which may be adjacent to a building on the site. Such interior landscaping that is relocated as herein provided shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements of subsection 7.920e. of this Ordinance. 
The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any interior landscaped area where said area is at least three and one-half (3½) feet in depth adjacent to the abutting parking space and protected by wheel stops or curbing. Two (2) feet of said landscaped area may be part of the required depth of each abutting parking space. 
Parking lot storm drainage shall be designed so as to direct water from paved areas to the landscaped areas to allow absorption into the permeable ground prior to discharge into the Public Street or storm drainage system. This should be accomplished in a manner not likely to result in erosion. 
h.  Sight Distance for Landscaping Adjacent to Public Right-of-Way and Points of Access. 
When an access intersects a public right-of-way, all landscaping within the triangular areas described below shall be placed so as to provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between three (3) feet and seven (7) feet in height from the street level. Trees which have limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-visibility area described above may be allowed within the triangular area or allowed to protrude into the triangular area if they are otherwise located so as not to create a traffic hazard. No landscaping, other than grass or ground cover, shall be located within three (3) feet from the edge of any access or street pavement. 
The triangular areas above referred to are: 
The area of property on each side of an access way which is within a triangle two sides of which are each fifteen (15) feet in length, one measured along the access way from the point of its intersection with the public street curb (or street pavement edge if there is no curb) and the other measured along the curb (or street pavement if there is no curb) from its intersection with the access way, and the third side of the triangle being a line connecting the ends of the two (2) other sides. 
 
Landscape Preservation. The existing natural landscape, especially plants, shrubs and trees native to the area, shall be preserved to the extent reasonable and feasible. Indiscriminate clearing or stripping of natural vegetation is prohibited. Landscape to be removed or retained shall be reviewed as part of the site plan approval process by the Planning and Zoning Commission or as part of the building permit process by the Director of Planning and Building in the event that site plan review is not required. No landscaping may be removed before approval of the site plan or building permit. The criteria to be applied by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by the Director of Planning and Building as appropriate, as typographical constraints on design, drainage, ingress and egress, utilities and other factors reasonably related to health, safety and welfare of the public, the nature and quality of the landscaping installed to replace existing natural landscaping and such other factors as may be relevant and proper. 
Protection of Trees. 
No person or entity shall remove, contribute to the removal or endanger any tree having a trunk circumference of thirty inches (30") or more, measured four (4) feet above natural grade level which is situated within the boundaries of the area to which the landscape requirements apply as set out in Section 7.900 above, without a tree removal permit from the Director of Planning and Building. Removal and endangerment include uprooting, severing the main trunk of the tree or any act which may reasonably be expected to cause the tree to die including without limitation damage inflicted upon the root system by machinery, storage or materials or soil compaction; substantially changing the natural grade above the root system or around the trunk; excessive pruning; paving with concrete asphalt or other impervious materials in a manner which may reasonably be expected to kill the tree, or a lack of adequate protection during the construction process. 
Trees which are designated on an approved site plan or an approved building permit for removal are exempt from the requirement of a removal permit. 
The Director of Planning and Building shall issue a removal permit for all trees that are, in his determination, so located as to prevent reasonable access to the property or to prevent reasonable use of the property, that constitute a hazard to life or property which cannot be reasonable mitigated without removing the tree, if the tree is dying, dead or diseased to the point that it constitutes a danger to other trees or that it cannot be reasonably be restored to sound condition. Approval for removal is automatically granted ten (10) working days after the application is filed, if not denied during such time. 
Planting a replacement tree or trees or other landscaping may be required as a condition of approving an application for removal of a protected tree if there is adequate space for additional landscaping than is required of a new development under this Ordinance. 
If a tree is removed without a permit or in the determination of the Director of Planning and Building, dies due to injury, endangerment or improper planting, the tree shall be replaced with a tree of similar species, trunk size and height. If a replacement tree is not available or cannot be transplanted the owner shall submit an alternative plan for additional landscaping to the Director of Planning and Building for approval. All replacement shall be completed within twelve (12) months after removal of the protected tree. 
The Director of Planning and Building may rely on the certification of a qualified arboriculturist in making any of the determinations required of him or her in this section.
