found to be a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. No animal which, at the time of the acts complained
of, was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, or its owner or
owner's property, shall be found to be a dangerous dog or a vicious dog.
The owner of any animal found to be a dangerous dog shall, within 10 days of such finding, obtain
a dangerous dog registration certificate from the local animal control officer for a fee of $50 in
addition to other fees that may be authorized by law. The local animal control officer shall also

tag at all times. All certificates obtained pursuant to this subdivision shall be renewed annually for
the same fee and in the same manner as the initial certificate was obtained.

and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on the property; and

electronic implantation.

indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked structure of sufficient height and design to prevent its
escape or direct contact with or entry by minors, adults, or other animals. The structure shall be
designed to provide the animal with shelter from the elements of nature. When off its owner's

decision of the Building Official required by Subsection (b) above. When an appeal is perfected,
the Building Code Board of Appeals shall schedule a hearing for a specified time and place within
30 days of the filing of the appeal. At the hearing, after hearing such testimony and examining

noting such appeal shall not be required to comply with the notice as served, it may modify the
directions in the notice and require compliance with the modified notice.
The decision of the Building Official shall be final in cases of emergency which, in his opinion,
involve imminent danger to human life or health by reason of the existence of an unsafe building,
wall or structure. He shall promptly cause any such unsafe building, wall or structure or portion
thereof to be made safe or removed. For this purpose, he may at once enter such building or

requirements thereof or who shall erect, construct, alter or repair a building or structure in violation
of an approved plan or directive of the building or code official or of a permit or certificate issued
under the provisions of this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not
more than $2,500. Each day that a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
If the violation concerns a residential unit and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of the
conviction, the court shall order the violator to abate or remedy the violation in order to comply
with the Code. Except as otherwise provided by the court for good cause shown, any such violator
shall abate or remedy the violation within six months of the date of conviction. Any person
convicted of a second offense committed within less than five years after a first offense under this
chapter shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500. Any person

pursuant to this subsection and sets a time by which such hazard must be abated, each day the
hazard remains unabated after the time set for the abatement has expired shall constitute a
separate violation of this chapter. Upon a reasonable showing to the court by a landlord as defined
in Code of Virginia, § 55-248.4, that such landlord is financially unable to abate the lead-base
paint hazard, the court shall order any rental agreement related to the affected premises
terminated effective 30 days from the entry of the court order. For the purposes of the preceding
sentence, termination of the rental agreement shall not be deemed noncompliance by the landlord
as described in Code of Virginia, § 55-248.21.

Reinspection fees. Whenever the Building Official shall determine that a second or additional
inspection trip is necessary due to the failure of an owner, contractor or subcontractor to properly
correct faulty work or whenever an inspection has been requested before the work to be inspected
has been completed to the degree required; or whenever the inspector cannot obtain reasonable
access to the work to be inspected, the inspector shall assess a service charge of $20. Such
charge shall be chargeable to the holder of the permit covering such work and shall be paid prior

Permit extension and suspension. Any permit issued shall become invalid if the authorized work is
not commenced within six months after issuance of the permit; or if the authorized work is
suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time of commencement of the work;
the failure to complete enough work to schedule an inspection during any six-month period may
be grounds for finding that work has been abandoned or suspended; however, permits issued for
building equipment such as plumbing, electrical and mechanical work shall not become invalid if
the building permit is still in effect. Upon written request, and for good cause shown, the Building
Official may grant one or more extensions of time not to exceed six months per extension. Such
request shall be in writing and submitted prior to the permit becoming invalid. The fee shall be $20
per extension.
Fees based on construction valuation. Where the provisions of this section require the payment of

issuance of any permit.
Refunds of fees. The Building Official may authorize the refunding of any permit fee paid pursuant
to this section upon application by the person who paid such fee under the following conditions:
If an applicant requests in writing the cancellation of a permit prior to the start of construction
or requests for inspections, the permit fees, less a service charge of $20 and the plan review
fee, if applicable, shall be refunded.
If an applicant requests in writing the cancellation of a permit after the work authorized by the
permit has begun and inspections have been made, the permit fees, less a $20 service
charge, a $20 charge for each inspection made and the plans review fee, if applicable, shall
be refunded.

Article IV. Buildings and Other Structures Harboring Illegal
Drug Use
§ 6-48. Findings.
[Ord. of 3-22-1999(1)]
The City Council finds that there is an increasing use of real property within the City for criminal
violations of state laws governing controlled substances. The Council also finds that such use
continues despite law enforcement efforts of the City police, with repeated offenses being
committed at the same properties.
The Council further finds that this problem has deleterious effects on the quality of life in the
neighborhoods in which it occurs, diminishes the property values of other neighborhood
properties, is detrimental to public safety and increases the cost of law enforcement in the City.
Therefore, the Council finds it to be in the public interest to authorize and empower the
appropriate City officials to take corrective action to abate drug blight on real property in the City in
cases in which property owners fail to take corrective action within the period set forth below.

property, such as removal, repair or securing of any building, wall or structure.
DRUG BLIGHT
A condition existing on real property which tends to endanger the public health or safety of City
residents and is caused by the regular presence of the property of persons under the influence of
controlled substances or the regular use of the property for the purpose of illegally possessing,

§ 6-50. Enforcement procedures.
[Ord. of 3-22-1999(1)]
In the event that there exists drug blight on certain real property in the City despite law
enforcement efforts to prevent such blight, the Chief of Police or designee of the chief shall
execute an affidavit, citing Code of Virginia, § 15.2-907, affirming (i) that drug blight exists on the
property and in the manner described therein; (ii) that the City has used due diligence without
effect to abate the drug blight; and (iii) that the drug blight constitutes a present threat to the
public's health, safety or welfare.
This affidavit shall be submitted to the Building Official requesting that the last known owner of the
property be notified of the drug blight by regular mail sent to the address of said owner as it
appears in the assessment records of the City.
The Building Official shall send out by regular mail a notice, with a copy of the affidavit, to the
owner of record at such address advising that (i) the owner has up to 30 days from the date
thereof to undertake corrective action to abate the drug blight described in the affidavit and (ii) the
City will, if requested to do so, assist the owner in determining and coordinating the appropriate
corrective action to abate the drug blight described in the affidavit.
If no corrective action is taken by the owner within such thirty-day period, the Building Official shall
send a second notice by regular mail to the owner at the address used in the first notice stating a
date, no earlier than 15 days after the mailing of the second notice, after which the City may
commence corrective action to abate the drug blight on the property. This second notice shall also
reasonably describe the corrective action contemplated to be taken by the City.
Upon receipt of the second notice the owner shall have a right, upon notice given to the City within
no more than 15 days of receipt of such second notice, to seek equitable relief from an
appropriate court, and the City shall initiate no corrective action while a proper petition for relief is
pending before a court of competent jurisdiction.
If the City undertakes corrective action with respect to the property after complying with the notice
requirements set forth above, the costs and expenses thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by
the owner of such property and may be collected by the City as taxes are collected.
Every charge authorized by this article with which the owner of any such property has been
assessed and which remains unpaid shall constitute a lien on said property with the same priority
as liens for unpaid local taxes and enforceable in the same manner as provided in Code of
Virginia, § 58.1-3940 et seq. and § 58.1-3965 et seq.
If the owner of such property takes timely corrective action pursuant to this article, and the City
determines that the drug blight is properly abated as verified by a final written report prepared by
the Building Official and approved by the Chief of Police, then the proceedings shall promptly be
terminated, there shall be no charge or cost to the owner and the owner shall be immediately
notified in writing of the satisfactory closing of the abatement proceedings. The closing of a
proceeding shall not bar the City from initiating a subsequent proceeding if the drug blight recurs.
Nothing in this article shall be construed to abridge or waive any rights or remedies of an owner of
property in law or in equity.

The City of Franklin hereby designates the Department of Public Works as the plan-approving
authority.
The program and regulations set forth by reference in this section are available for public
inspection at the office of the Director of Public Works.
§ 9-5. Application for plan approval.
[Ord. of 3-13-2000; amended 7-14-2008]
Except as provided in Subsection (c) or § 9-6, no person may engage in any land-disturbing
activity in the City until such person has submitted to the Department of Public Works an erosion
and sediment control plan for such activity and until such plan has been approved by the
Department of Public Works. Where land-disturbing activities involve lands under the jurisdiction
of more than one local control program, an erosion and sediment control plan, at the option of the
applicant, may be submitted to the Board for review and approval rather than to each jurisdiction
concerned. Where the land-disturbing activity results from the construction of a single-family
residence, an agreement in lieu of a plan may be substituted for an erosion and sediment control
plan if executed by the plan-approving authority.
No agency or department authorized under any other ordinance or law to issue building or other
permits for activities involving land-disturbing activities covered by this chapter may issue such
permits unless the applicant submits with the application a copy of an approved erosion and
sediment control plan or a permit from the Department of Public Works indicating approval of such
plan.
The standards contained within the "Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations," the
Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended, are to be used by the applicant
when making a submittal under the provisions of this chapter and in the preparation of an erosion
and sediment control plan. The plan-approving authority, in considering the adequacy of a
submitted plan, shall be guided by the same standards, regulations, and guidelines. When the
standards vary between the publications, the state regulations shall take precedence.
Where the land-disturbing activity will result from the construction of a single-family residence, an
agreement in lieu of a plan may be substituted for an erosion and sediment control plan. If a
violation occurs during the land-disturbing activity, then the person responsible for carrying out the
agreement in lieu of a plan shall correct the violation and provide the name of an individual holding
a certificate of competence as provided by Code of Virginia § 10.1-561[1] of the Virginia Erosion

harvested is reforested in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 10.1-1100 et seq., or is converted to
bona fide agricultural or improved pasture use as set forth in Code of Virginia, § 10.1-1163B;
Agricultural engineering operations, including, but not limited to, the construction of terraces,
terrace outlets, check dams, desilting basins, dikes, ponds not required to comply with the
provisions of the Dam Safety Act (Code of Virginia § 10.1-604 et seq.), ditches, strip cropping,
lister furrowing, contour furrowing, contour cultivating, land drainage and land irrigation;
Repair or rebuilding of the tracks, rights-of-way, bridges, communication facilities and related
structures and facilities of a railroad company;
Disturbed land areas less than 5,000 square feet in size;
Installation of fence and sign posts, utility poles and other posts and poles;
Shore erosion control projects on tidal waters, when the projects are approved by local wetland
boards, the Marine Resources Commission or the United States Army Corps of Engineers; and
Emergency work to protect life, limb or property and emergency repairs, provided that if the landdisturbing
activity would have required an approved erosion and sediment control plan if a
nonemergency, then the land area disturbed shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the directives of the Department of Public Works.
§ 9-7. Submission and approval of plans; bonds and permits.
[Ord. of 3-13-2000; amended 7-14-2008]

reference in the City erosion and sediment control program. Where the land-disturbing activity
results from the construction of a single family residence, an agreement in lieu of a plan executed
by the owner and an authorized representative of the Department of Public Works may be
substituted for an erosion and sediment control plan, and the permit fee shall be waived.
A certified plan reviewer in the Department of Public Works shall review such plans for compliance
with the standards incorporated by reference in the City erosion and sediment control program.
The Department of Public Works, within 45 days of submission of the plans, shall approve such
plan, if it is determined that the plan meets the requirements of the City erosion and sediment
control program and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan certifies that such person
will properly perform the erosion and sediment control measures included in the plan and will
conform to the provisions of this chapter. If no formal action has been taken within 45 days, the
plan shall be deemed approved and the person submitting the plan is authorized to proceed with
the proposed land-disturbing activity.
In the event that the plan is disapproved, the applicant shall be notified in writing, within 45 days of
its submission, of the disapproval, the reasons therefor and the changes that would be required for
approval.
When a land-disturbing activity will be required of a contractor performing construction work
pursuant to a construction contract, the obtaining of a permit under this chapter, together with the
required plan submissions, shall be the responsibility of the person owning the property. In
addition, as a prerequisite to engaging in the land disturbing activities shown on the approved
plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall provide the name of an individual
holding a certificate of competence, to the program authority as provided by § 10.1-561 of the
Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law,[1] who will be in charge and responsible for carrying
out the land-disturbing activity. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of
competence prior to engaging in land-disturbing activities may result in revocation of the approval
of the plan, and the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties
provided in this chapter. However, the plan-approving authority may waive the certificate of
competence requirement for agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a single-family
residence. If a violation occurs during the land-disturbing activity, then the person responsible for
carrying out the agreement in lieu of a plan shall correct the violation and provide the name of an
individual holding a certificate of competence, as provided by § 10.1-561 of the Virginia Erosion
and Sediment Control Law.[2] Failure to provide the name of an individual holing a certificate of
competence shall be a violation of this chapter.

Prior to the issuance of a permit for a land-disturbing activity by a department of the City, the
owner of the property or an agent of the owner shall execute and file with such department a
performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit or any combination thereof to ensure
that measures could be taken by the issuing department at the permittee's expense should the
permittee fail, after proper notice, within the time specified, to initiate or maintain appropriate
conservation action which may be required of the permittee by the approved plan. The amount of
the bond or other security for performance shall not exceed the total of the estimated cost to
initiate and maintain appropriate conservation action based on the unit price for new public or
private sector construction in the City and a reasonable allowance for estimated administrative
costs and inflation, which shall not exceed 25% of the estimated cost of the conservation action. If
such department takes such conservation action upon such failure by the permittee, the said
department may collect from the permittee for any additional cost should the amount of the
reasonable cost of such action exceed the amount of the security held. Any performance bond
with surety or letter of credit utilized hereunder shall be approved by the City Attorney and shall
guarantee that the required control measures will be properly and satisfactorily undertaken and
maintained.

After approval of the plan is obtained and the required performance bond, cash escrow or letter of
credit is filed or the applicant has a fully executed agreement in lieu of a plan, a permit for the
land-disturbing activity may be issued, which permit shall be valid for a period of one year from the
date of issuance. The permit shall reserve a right of entry by certified inspectors to conduct
inspections of the measures being taken to control erosion and sediment resulting from the landdisturbing
activities. The permit may be extended for additional periods by written approval of the
issuing department, upon receipt of evidence of reasonable progress toward completion of the
approved project and current compliance with all the conditions of the plan.
An approved plan may be changed by the Department of Public Works in the following cases:
Where an inspection has revealed that the plan is inadequate to satisfy applicable
regulations; or
Where the person responsible for carrying out the approved plan finds that, because of
changed circumstances or for other reasons, the approved plan cannot be effectively carried
out, and proposed amendments to the plan, consistent with the requirements of this chapter,
are agreed to by the Department of Public Works and the person responsible for carrying out
the plan.
Within 60 days of the achievement of adequate stabilization of the land-disturbing activities in
accordance with the plan or amended plan, the bond, cash escrow or letter of credit, or the
unobligated or unexpended portion thereof, shall be either refunded to the applicant or terminated.
Variances. The plan-approving authority may waive or modify any of the standards that are
deemed to be too restrictive for site conditions, by granting a variance. A variance may be granted
under these conditions:
At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance to become part of the
approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant shall explain the reasons for
requesting variances in writing. Specific variances which are allowed by the plan-approving
authority shall be documented in the plan.
During construction, the person responsible for implementing the approved plan may request
a variance in writing from the plan-approving authority. The plan-approving authority shall
respond in writing, either approving or disapproving such a request. If the plan-approving
authority does not approve a variance within 10 days of receipt of the request, the request
shall be considered to be disapproved. Following disapproval, the applicant may resubmit a
variance request with additional documentation.
§ 9-8. Inspections; notice of noncompliance; revocation of permit.
[Ord. of 3-13-2000; amended 7-14-2008]
The administrator shall provide for periodic inspections of the land-disturbing activity by certified
inspectors within the Department of Public Works or in the office of the Building Official and may,
in appropriate cases, require monitoring and reports from the person responsible for carrying out
the plan to ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures
required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sediment. The owner, permittee or
person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection.
If the administrator determines that there is a failure to comply with the plan, notice shall be served
upon the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan by registered or certified mail to
the address specified in the permit application or in the plan certification or by delivery at the site
of the land-disturbing activities to the agent or employee supervising such activities. Where the
administrator serves notice, a copy of the notice shall also be sent to the department issuing the
land-disturbing permit. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the plan and

shall specify the time within which such measures should be completed. Upon failure to comply
within the time specified, the permit may be revoked, and the permittee or person responsible for
carrying out the plan shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties
provided herein.
Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from a certified
inspector, the administrator may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as
specified in Subsection (b) above, issue an order requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing
activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken
or, if land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan or any required permits,
requiring that all land-disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any required
permits are obtained.
Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger of causing harmful erosion
of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the commonwealth, or where
the land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan or any required permits,
such an order may be issued whether or not the alleged violator has been issued a notice to
comply as specified in Subsection (b) above. Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after
the alleged violator has failed to comply with the notice to comply.
The order referenced in Subsections (c) and (d) above shall be served in the same manner as the
notice to comply and shall remain in effect for seven days from the date of service pending
application by the City or the alleged violator for appropriate relief to the Circuit Court of
Southampton County. If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved plan or all required
permits within seven days from the date of service of the order, the administrator may issue an
order to the owner requiring that all construction and other work on the site, other than corrective
measures, be stopped until an approved plan and all required permits have been obtained. Such
an order shall be served upon the owner by registered or certified mail to the address specified in
the permit application or the land records of the City.
The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the Circuit Court of Southampton County. Any
person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey an order issued by the administrator or
his designee may be compelled in a proceeding in said court to obey same and to comply
therewith by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate remedy. Upon completion and approval of
corrective action or upon obtaining an approved plan or any required permits, the order shall
immediately be lifted. Nothing in this section shall prevent the administrator from taking any other
action specified in this chapter.
§ 9-9. Erosion impact areas.
[Ord. of 3-13-2000; amended 7-14-2008]
The City Council may designate areas in the City which shall be classified as erosion impact
areas. Any such designation and classification shall be deemed to be a component of the City's
erosion and sediment control program.
Consistent with the City's erosion and sediment control program and in order to prevent further
erosion, the administrator may require the approval of a conservation plan for any erosion impact
area. If required, the owner must submit the conservation plan. Such plan shall be subject to all
review, bonding, inspection and enforcement provisions of this chapter which apply to erosion and
sediment control plans.

Final decisions of the Department of Public Works or the administrator under this chapter shall be
subject to review by the Southampton County Circuit Court, provided that an appeal is filed within 30
days from the date any written decision adversely affecting the rights, duties or privileges of the person
engaging in or proposing to engage in land-disturbing activities.
§ 9-12. Violations or exceeding scope of approval.
[Ord. of 3-13-2000; amended 7-14-2008]
Any person who engages in or causes any regulated land-disturbing activity without first receiving
plan approval and a permit for such activity as prescribed by this chapter shall be in violation of
this chapter, and such person shall be subject to civil penalties set forth below in § 9-13.

chapter or who exceeds the scope of approval of any such plan shall be in violation of this chapter,
and such person shall be subject to civil penalties set forth below in § 9-13.
§ 9-13. Penalties, injunctions and other legal actions.
[Ord. of 3-13-2000; amended 7-14-2008]
The civil penalty for any one violation of this chapter shall be $100, except that the civil penalty for
commencement of land-disturbing activities without an approved plan shall be $1,000. Each day
during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. In no event
shall a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts result in civil
penalties which exceed a total of $3,000, except that a series of violations arising from the
commencement of land-disturbing activities without an approved plan for any site shall not result
in civil penalties which exceed a total of $10,000.
A civil action for a violation of this chapter shall be brought by the administrator or a certified
inspector, who shall issue a summons for the collection of the civil penalty. The case shall be
heard in the City of Franklin General District Court. In such action, the City shall have the burden
of proof to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission or
finding of liability shall not be a criminal conviction for any purpose. Any civil penalties assessed
by the court shall be paid into the City treasury; except that where the violator is the City or its
agent, the court shall direct that the penalty be paid into the state treasury.

The administrator or the owner of property which has sustained damage or which is in imminent
danger of being damaged may apply to the Southampton County Circuit Court to enjoin a violation
or threatened violation of this chapter without the necessity of showing that an adequate remedy
at law does not exist; however, an owner of property shall not apply for injunctive relief unless:
He has notified, in writing, the person who has violated the City's erosion and sediment
control program and the City that a violation of the said program has caused, or creates a
probability of causing, damage to his property; and
Neither the person who has violated the said program nor the City has taken corrective action
within 15 days of such notice to eliminate the conditions which have caused, or create the
possibility of causing, damage to his property.
In addition to any civil penalties provided under this chapter, any person who violates any
provision of this chapter may be liable to the City or the Board, as appropriate, in a civil action for
damages.
Without limiting the remedies which may be obtained in this section, any person violating or failing,
neglecting or refusing to obey any injunction, mandamus or other remedy obtained pursuant to
this section shall be subject, in the discretion of the court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000
for each violation. A civil action for such violation or failure may be brought by the City with
reference to property located in the City. Any civil penalties assessed by the court shall be paid
into the City treasury; except that where the violator is the City or its agent, the court shall direct
that the penalty be paid into the state treasury.

§ 9-20. Submission and approval required.
[Ord. No. 102, 2-14-1977; amended 7-14-2008]
No person shall engage in any land-disturbing activity until such person has submitted to the City
Manager four copies of an erosion and sedimentation control plan for such land-disturbing activity
and until such plan has been reviewed and approved by the City Manager.
In accordance with the procedure set forth by § 10.1-563(E) of the Code of Virginia,[1] any person
engaging in the creation and operation of wetland mitigation banks in multiple jurisdictions, which
have been approved and are operated in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance,

Chapter 12. GAMBLING
§ 12-1. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this section:
GAMBLING DEVICE
Any device, machine, paraphernalia, equipment or other thing, including books, records and
other papers, which are actually used in an illegal gambling operation or activity; and
Any machine, apparatus, implement, instrument, contrivance, board or other thing, including
but not limited to those dependent upon the insertion of a coin or other object for their
operation, which operates, either completely automatically or with the aid of some physical act
by the player or operator, in such a manner that, depending upon elements of chance, it may
eject something of value or determines the prize or other thing of value to which the player is
entitled; however, the return to the user of nothing more than additional chances or the right to
use such machine is not deemed something of value; and further, machines that only sell, or
entitle the user to, items of merchandise of equivalent value that may differ from each other in
composition, size, shape or color, shall not be deemed gambling devices.
Such devices are no less gambling devices if they indicate beforehand the definite
result of one or more operations, but not all the operations; nor are they any less
gambling devices because, apart from their use or adaptability as such, they may also
sell or deliver something of value on a basis other than chance.
ILLEGAL GAMBLING
The making, placing or receipt of any bet or wager in this City of money or other thing of value,
made in exchange for a chance to win a prize, stake or other consideration or thing of value,

uncertain or a matter of chance, whether such game, contest or event occurs or is to occur inside
or outside the limits of this City.
OPERATOR
Any person who conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs or owns all or part of an illegal
gambling enterprise, activity or operation.
§ 12-2. Illegal gambling generally.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any person who illegally gambles shall be guilty of a
Class 3 misdemeanor. If an association or pool of persons illegally gamble, each person therein shall

§ 12-3. Winning by fraud.
If any person, while gambling, cheats or by fraudulent means, wins or acquires for himself or another
money or any other valuable thing, he shall be fined not less than five nor more than 10 times the
value of such winnings. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this
chapter.
§ 12-4. Permitting gambling to continue in one's premises.
9/11/2020 City of Franklin, VA Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/FR3551?guid=FR3551&children=true 106/511

activity, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

custody or use of any gambling device, believing or having reason to believe that the same is to be
used in the advancement of any illegal gambling activity. A violation of any provision of this section
shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor.
§ 12-7. Forfeiture of money, gambling devices, etc., seized from
illegal gambling enterprise.
All money, gambling devices, office equipment and other personal property used in connection with an
illegal gambling enterprise or activity, and all money, stakes and things of value received or proposed
to be received by a winner in any illegal gambling transaction, which are lawfully seized by any City
police officer or which shall lawfully come into his custody shall be forfeited to the City by order of the
court in which a conviction under this chapter is obtained. Such court shall order all money so forfeited
to be paid over to the City and, by order, shall make such disposition of other property so forfeited as
the court deems proper, including award of such property to any City or state agency or charitable
organization for lawful purposes, or in case of the sale thereof, the proceeds therefrom to be paid over
to the City. Such forfeiture shall not extinguish the rights of any person without knowledge of the illegal
use of such property who is the lawful owner or who has a lien on the same which has been perfected
in the manner provided by law.
§ 12-8. Certain acts not deemed "consideration" in prosecution
under chapter.
In any prosecution under this chapter, no consideration shall be deemed to have passed or been given
because of any person's attendance upon the premises of another; his execution, mailing or delivery of
an entry blank; his answering of questions, verbally or in writing; his witnessing of a demonstration or
other proceeding; or any one or more thereof, where no charge is made to, paid by, or any purchase

§ 12-10. Same  Games of chance in private residences.

conducted in a private residence, provided such private residence is not commonly used for such
games of chance and there is no operator, as defined in § 12-1.

§ 15-13. License requirement.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996; amended by Ord. of 12-11-2000; Ord. No. 2005-4, 2-28-2005; 2-22-2010]
Every person engaging in this jurisdiction in any business, trade, profession, occupation or calling
(collectively hereinafter "a business"), as defined in this article, unless otherwise exempted by law,
shall apply for a license for each such business if (i) such person maintains a definite place of
business in this jurisdiction; (ii) such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does
maintain an abode in this jurisdiction, which abode for the purposes of this article shall be deemed
a definite place of business; or (iii) there is no definite place of business but such person operates
amusement machines, is engaged as a peddler or itinerant merchant, carnival or circus as
specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3717, 58.1-3718, or 58.1-3728, or is a contractor subject to
Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715, or is a public service corporation subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-
3731. A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business. A person engaged
in two or more businesses or professions carried on at the same place of business may elect to
obtain one license for all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are
satisfied: (i) each business or profession is licensable at the location and has satisfied any
requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of this jurisdiction; (ii) all
of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate, or, if subject to different tax
rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and
(iii) the taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the
nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts.
Each person subject to a license tax shall apply for a license prior to beginning business if he was
not subject to licensing in this jurisdiction on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later
than March 1 of the current license year if he had been issued a license for the preceding license
year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Revenue.

(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not based on gross receipts. If
the tax is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before March
1, except that for businesses beginning after February 1 of any year, the tax shall be paid on or
before the expiration of 30 days after the commencement of business.
The Commissioner of Revenue may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90 days, in which to
file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension shall be conditioned upon the
timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the
correct tax at the end of the extension together with interest from the due date until the date paid
and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the
circumstances, a penalty of 10% of the portion paid after the due date.
A penalty of 10% of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the failure to
pay the tax by the appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the
Commissioner of Revenue if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties
may be assessed if the Commissioner of Revenue determines that the taxpayer has a history of
noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the Commissioner of
Revenue, if the application and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the
understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by
the taxpayer, there shall be no late penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of
tax by the Commissioner of Revenue is not paid within 30 days, the Treasurer may impose a 10%
late payment penalty. The penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the
official who assessed them, if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to
demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure
was due to events beyond his control.
"Acted responsibly" means that: (i) the taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a
prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the
business; and (ii) the taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as
requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable
impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure
once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered.
"Events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of records
due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the
person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in
good faith upon erroneous written information from the Commissioner of Revenue, who was
aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous
information.
Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due date until the date paid
without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of
additional or omitted tax by the Commissioner of Revenue is found to be erroneous, all interest
and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall
be refunded, together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date,
whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any tax paid under this article from the
date of payment or due date, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or
other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at a rate of 10% per year commencing on the
first day of the month following the due date of the tax.
No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the
conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, in
the event of such adjustment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than 30
days from (i) the date of the payment that created the refund; or (ii) the due date of the tax,
whichever is later.

[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this chapter is measured by gross receipts, the gross
receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the
exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within this jurisdiction. In the case
of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer
location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such
activities are initiated, directed, or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications
of business shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows:
The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which
his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of
business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or
controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715.
The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of
business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not
occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales
solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house
subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by
the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchases goods, wares
and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two
or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different
measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper
measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality.
The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the
definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the
property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business
at which the rental of such property is managed.
The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of
business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of
business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or
controlled.
Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or
impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed
under the general rule and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment
agreement, except as to circumstances set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3709, the gross
receipts of the businesses shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the
basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless
some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such
definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another
jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this jurisdiction solely because the other jurisdiction does not
impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other
jurisdiction.
Agreements. The Commissioner of Revenue may enter into agreements with any other political
subdivision of Virginia concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among
definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by this agreement
shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business
affected by this agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross
receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in
which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to,
result in taxes on more than 100% of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected
jurisdictions, the Commissioner of Revenue shall make a good faith effort to reach an
apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved.

§ 15-15. Limitations and extensions.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed
pursuant to this chapter, both the Commissioner of Revenue and the taxpayer have consented in
writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the
expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the Commissioner of Revenue shall assess the
local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license
year and the six preceding years.
The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code
of Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has
been extended pursuant to this subdivision, two years after the final determination of an appeal for
which collection has been stayed pursuant to § 15-16(b) or 15-16(d), or two years after the final
decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984, or similar law for which
collection has been stayed, whichever is later.
§ 15-16. Appeals and rulings.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
Any person assessed with a licensing tax under this chapter as the result of an audit may apply
within 90 days from the date of the assessment to the Commissioner of Revenue for a correction
of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer,
audit period, remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the
taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The assessor may hold
a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional
information and documents, further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and
equitable determination of the applications. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct.
The Commissioner of Revenue shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a
determination to the taxpayer setting forth his position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit
shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the
specific procedure to be followed in the jurisdiction (e.g., the name and address to which an
application should be directed).
Provided an application is made within 90 days of an assessment, collection activity shall be
suspended until a final determination is issued by the Commissioner of Revenue, unless the
Commissioner of Revenue determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the
taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest
shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of § 15-13(f), but no further penalty shall be
imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding
that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires (i) to depart quickly from the locality, (ii)
to remove his property therefrom, (iii) to conceal himself or his property therein, or (iv) to do any
other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the
tax for the period in question.
Any person assessed with a license tax under this chapter as a result of an audit may apply within
90 days of the determination by the Commissioner of Revenue on an application pursuant to § 15-
16(a) to the Tax Commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The Tax Commissioner shall
issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless
the taxpayer and the Commissioner of Revenue are notified that a longer period will be required.
The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1821, and
9/11/2020 City of Franklin, VA Ecode360

(b)
the Tax Commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to Code of
Virginia, § 58.1-1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the Commissioner of
Revenue may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984.
However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the Tax
Commissioner is erroneous. Neither the Tax Commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be
made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the Tax Commissioner
has ruled on it.
On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the Tax Commissioner under § 15-16(c), the
Commissioner of Revenue shall further suspend collection activity, until a final determination is
issued by the Tax Commissioner, unless the Commissioner of Revenue determines that collection
would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant
information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of
§ 15-13(f), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term
"jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in § 15-16(b).
Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of the tax to a specific
situation from the Commissioner of Revenue. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all
the relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of
the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or
the factual situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A
written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if (i) there is a change in the law, a court
decision, or (ii) the Commissioner of Revenue notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or
interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling
which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which
such ruling was in effect.
§ 15-17. Recordkeeping and audits.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
Every person who is assessable with a license tax shall keep sufficient records to enable the
Commissioner of Revenue to verify the correctness of the tax paid for the license years assessable
and to enable the Commissioner of Revenue to ascertain what is the correct amount of tax that was
assessable for each of those years. All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be
open to inspection and examination by the Commissioner of Revenue in order to allow the
Commissioner of Revenue to establish whether a particular receipt is directly attributable to the taxable
privilege exercised within this jurisdiction. The Commissioner of Revenue shall provide the taxpayer
with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office, if the records are maintained
there. In the event the records are maintained outside this jurisdiction, copies of the appropriate books
and records shall be sent to the Commissioner of Revenue's office upon demand.
§ 15-18. Exclusions and deductions from "gross receipts."
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
General rule. Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not include any amount not derived
from the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary
course of business or profession.
The following items shall be excluded from gross receipts:
Amounts received and paid to the United States, the Commonwealth or any county, City or
town for the Virginia retail sales or use tax, or for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on
cigarettes, for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels.

Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent
that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts
receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the
creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business).
Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the business to its customer.
Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the obligor.
Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the
creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon the sale of a capital asset.
Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by the licensee. A rebate
or other incentive offered to induce the recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a
person other than the offeror, and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration
of the sale of goods and services shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the licensee,
but shall be included in the licensee's gross receipts together with any handling or other fees
related to the incentive.
Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution and for which no
consideration is received and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory,
whether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes.
Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a licensable business not
classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank
accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the
investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the
licensed privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, late fees and similar income
attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular course of
business.
The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases that would otherwise be
taxable:
Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to a United States federal
or state government entity provided that such property was purchased within two years of the
sale to said entity by the original purchaser who shall have been contractually obligated at the
time of purchase to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This
deduction shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply only to the original cost of the
property and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not apply to any of the tangible
personal property which was the subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a
state or federal government entity in accordance with the original contract obligation.
§ 15-19. Minimum license for separate places of business.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
Any person prosecuting a business in more than one place of business and keeping one set of records
for the accumulated transactions may take out a minimum license on each location, other than the
main place of business, and may enter as a deductible item, on the application for a license for the
main place of business, the amount of sales for which a license or licenses have been issued for the
other place or places of business.

In addition to all other lawful means of ascertaining the amount of any license tax, the Commissioner of
Revenue or any duly sworn deputy may propound interrogatories to the applicant and use such other
evidence as such officer may procure. Such interrogatories shall be answered under oath by the
person or entity desiring to do or doing business in the City.
§ 15-21. Estimates to determine tax for beginners, etc.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
For the purpose of ascertaining the license tax to be paid by any person beginning a new
business, employment or profession, and whose license tax is based on gross receipts, gross
sales, gross purchases, gross commissions, gross contracts or orders, the licensee shall, in good
faith, estimate the basis for measuring the license tax between the date of issuance of the license
and the 31st day of December of that license year.
The calculation of gross receipts for license tax purposes shall be either on a cash or accrual
basis; provided, however, that the basis used must coincide with the system of accounts used by
the taxpayer and the method employed by the taxpayer for federal and state income tax purposes.
The license tax of every person who was licensed at a definite place of business within the City for
only a part of the next preceding license year shall be computed for the then current license year
on the basis of an estimate of the amount of gross receipts, gross sales or gross purchases which
the licensee will make throughout the then current license year.
Every underestimate under this section shall be subject to correction by the Commissioner of
Revenue, whose duty it shall be to assess such licensee with such additional taxes as may be
found to be due after the close of the license year on the basis of gross receipts, gross sales,
gross purchases, gross commissions or gross contracts or orders. In case of overestimate, the
Commissioner shall order a refund in the amount of the overpaid tax.
§ 15-22. Assessment of tax and issuance of license generally.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996; amended by Ord. No. 2005-4, 2-28-2005; 2-22-2010]
The Commissioner of Revenue shall assess each applicant for a license or other person of whom a
license is required by this chapter with the license tax required by this chapter, and, upon receipt of
payment of the required tax, shall issue a license, signed by the Commissioner of Revenue, to
prosecute the business, employment, profession or thing to be done therein named, which license
shall not be valid or effective unless and until the tax required shall be paid to the Treasurer, as
collector of City taxes and levies, and such payment shall be shown on the license.
§ 15-23. Certificates prerequisite to issuance or validity.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
Prior to the issuance of any license under this chapter, the Commissioner of Revenue shall require
the applicant to furnish a valid zoning certificate issued by the zoning administration.
If a business is one for which a license can be granted only on the certificate of a court or other
officer, then such license shall not be issued as valid or effective until such certificate shall be
obtained.

[Ord. of 12-9-1996; amended by Ord. No. 2005-4, 2-28-2005; 2-22-2010]
Whenever the Commissioner of Revenue shall ascertain that any person should be assessed with
any additional license tax or taxes, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, he or she shall
thereupon assess such person with the additional tax and shall transmit a copy thereof to the
Treasurer.
In the event the additional license tax assessed under this section is not paid within 30 days after
such assessment, the Treasurer shall proceed to collect the same in the same manner and with
the same authority as all other taxes are collected, together with penalty and interest as provided
in this chapter.
§ 15-25. Proration of tax generally.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
In the event any person required to pay a license tax under the provisions of this chapter, where the
tax is not measured by gross receipts, gross sales, gross purchases, gross commissions, gross
contracts or orders, or graduated in any other way, shall begin any business, occupation or profession
after January 1 of the license year, the license tax shall be prorated on a monthly basis, one-twelfth of
the annual license tax to be assessed for each month or portion thereof for the remainder of the
license year, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
§ 15-26. Proration required when person, firm, or corporation
permanently ceases to engage in business, trade, profession or
calling.
[Ord. of 12-9-1996]
In the event that a person or entity ceases to engage in a business, trade, profession, occupation or
calling within the City during a year for which a license tax based upon gross receipts has already been
paid, the taxpayer shall be entitled upon application to a refund for that portion of the license tax based
upon gross receipts already paid, prorated on a monthly basis so as to ensure that the licensed
privilege is taxed only for that fraction of the year during which it is exercised within the City. The City
shall remit refunds in the ensuing fiscal year and shall offset against such refund any amount of pastdue
taxes owed by the same taxpayer. This refund shall not be required for those license taxes based
upon a flat fee or minimum flat tax.
§ 15-27. Display of license.

made, and after notice to the owner at his last-known address and to the holder of any lien of
record in the office of the State Division of Motor Vehicles against the motor vehicle, trailer or

vehicle, trailer or semitrailer is determined, by three disinterested dealers or garagemen, to be less

private sale or junked.

a first offense, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt, upon motion of the defendant, may
defer further proceeding and place the defendant on probation pending completion of a plan of
community service work. If the defendant completes the community service work as the court
prescribes, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him. Such
discharge and dismissal procedure under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and
operates as a conviction only for the purposes of applying this article in subsequent proceedings.
If the defendant fails or refuses to complete community service as ordered by the court, the court
may make final disposition of the case as otherwise provided. Any fine imposed pursuant to
conviction of a minor for violation of this section shall be assessed against the minor and such
minor's parents or legal guardian.
Community service work prescribed by the court under Subsection (b) shall include, to the extent
feasible, the repair, restoration, or replacement of any damage or defacement to property within

Definitions as used in this section:
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANT A JUSTIFIABLE AND REASONABLE ALARM OR
IMMEDIATE CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF PERSONS OR PROPERTY IN THE VICINITY
Circumstances in which specific and articulable facts, taken together with rational inferences
from those facts, reasonably warrant a finding that a breach of the peace is imminent, the
public safety is threatened or that there otherwise exists a strong likelihood of unlawful
behavior.
TO LOITER
To stand idle, loaf, hang around, linger, lag behind or walk about aimlessly.
TO PROWL
To move about or wander in a predatory or stealthy manner or as if in search of prey.
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual
for law-abiding persons, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or
immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm or
concern is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law
enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or endeavors to conceal himself or any object in his
possession or in close proximity to him.
Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement
officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity
to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him to identify himself and
explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if
the law enforcement officer did not comply with this procedure, or if it appears at trial the
explanation given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would have
dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or permit any motor vehicle to become an abandoned
motor vehicle as defined herein in the City. In any prosecution for a violation hereof proof that the
defendant was, at the time that the vehicle was found abandoned, the owner of the vehicle shall
constitute in evidence a rebuttal presumption that the owner was the person who committed the
violation. Such presumption, however, shall not arise if the owner of the vehicle provided notice to
the department, as provided in Code of Virginia, § 46.2-604, that he had sold or otherwise
transferred the ownership of the vehicle.
A summons for a violation of this section shall be executed by mailing a copy of the summons by
first class mail to the address of the owner of the vehicle as shown on the records of the
department. If the person fails to appear on the date of return set out in the summons, a new
summons shall be issued and delivered to the sheriff for service on the accused personally. If the
person so served then fails to appear on the date of return set out in the summons, proceedings
for contempt shall be instituted.

than $500. If any person fails to pay any such penalty, his privilege to drive a motor vehicle on the

highways of the state shall be suspended as provided in Code of Virginia, § 46.2-395. All penalties
collected hereunder shall be paid into the state treasury to be credited to the literary fund as
provided in Code of Virginia, § 46.2-114.
The City Manager, or designee, may take or cause to be taken into custody any abandoned motor
vehicle, may have the commissioner of revenue make a determination as to whether the motor
vehicle is operable or inoperable as defined hereinabove, and may dispose of such abandoned
motor vehicle. In this connection the City may employ its own personnel, equipment and facilities
or hire independent contractors for the purpose of removing, preserving and storing abandoned
motor vehicles.
When the City takes an abandoned motor vehicle into custody, the City Manager, or designee,
shall within 15 days notify the owner of record of the motor vehicle and all persons having security
interests in the vehicle of record that it has been taken into custody. The notice shall state the
year, make, model and serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle; set forth the location of the
facility where it is being held; and inform the owner and any persons having security interests of
their right to reclaim it within 15 days after the date of the notice, after payment of all towing,
preservation and storage charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody. The notice shall
state that the failure of the owner or persons having security interests to reclaim the vehicle within
the time provided shall constitute a waiver by the owner and all persons having security interests
of all right, title and interest in the vehicle, and shall further constitute consent to the sale of the
abandoned motor vehicle at a public auction.
If records of the department contain no address for the owner or no address of any person shown
by the department's records to have a security interest, or if the identity and addresses of the
owner and all persons having security interests cannot be determined with reasonable certainty,
notice by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City shall be sufficient to
meet all requirements of notice pursuant to this section as to any person who cannot be notified
pursuant to the foregoing provision of this section. Notice by publication may contain multiple
listings of abandoned motor vehicles. Any notice of this kind shall be within the time requirements
prescribed by this section for the notice by mail and shall have the same contents required for a
notice by mail.
The consequence of failure to reclaim an abandoned motor vehicle shall be set forth in any notice
given under this section.
In the event the owner of an abandoned motor vehicle wishes to reclaim such vehicle before it is
disposed of, such owner shall pay a $50 removal fee to the City or the towing fee, not to exceed
$50, and storage fee of any agent of the City who has towed and stored the vehicle.
If an abandoned motor vehicle is not reclaimed as provided above, the City Manager, or designee,
shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 46.2-617, sell it or cause it to be sold at
public auction. The purchaser of the motor vehicle shall take title to the motor vehicle free of all
liens and claims of ownership of others, shall receive a sales receipt at the auction, and shall be
entitled to apply for and receive from the department a certificate of title and registration card for
the vehicle. The sales receipt from the sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of transferring
the vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and in that case no further
titling of the vehicle shall be necessary. From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor
vehicle the City or its authorized agent shall reimburse itself for the expenses of the auction, the
cost of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle which resulted from placing the abandoned
motor vehicle in custody, and all notice and publication costs incurred pursuant to this section. Any
remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the abandoned motor vehicle
or any person having security interests therein, as their interests may appear, for 90 days, and
then be deposited into the general fund of the City.
Notwithstanding Subsection (a) above, any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or part thereof shall
be considered abandoned and may be reported by the garagekeeper to the City if it has been left
in a garage for more than 10 days or for more than 10 days beyond the period when the vehicle

persons having security interest of record therein to reclaim the vehicle within 15 days of the
notice. Any abandoned motor vehicle left in a garage may be taken into custody by the City in
accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the notice and sale
provisions set forth in this section. If, however, the vehicle is reclaimed, the person reclaiming it, in
addition to the other charges required to be paid, shall pay the reasonable charges of the
garagekeeper unless otherwise provided by contract. If the vehicle is sold pursuant to the
provisions of this section, any garagekeeper's charges shall be paid from, and to the extent of, the
excess of the proceeds of sale after paying the expenses of the auction, the costs of towing,
preserving and storing the vehicle which resulted from placing the vehicle in custody and all notice
and publication costs.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, any inoperable motor vehicle, trailer,
semitrailer or part of a motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer or semitrailer which has been taken into
custody pursuant to this section may be disposed of to a demolisher without the title and without
the notification procedures otherwise required by this section. The demolisher, on taking custody
of the inoperable motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, shall notify the department on forms and in
the manner prescribed by the commissioner.
When an inoperable abandoned motor vehicle left on property in the City has been disposed of
under Subsection (l) above, the City Manager, or designee, shall notify the department of such
demolition on forms provided by the department for reimbursement under Code of Virginia, § 46.2-
1207, and shall deposit any reimbursement received into the general funds of the City.

is required, and, after July 1, 2014, a stormwater management plan or an executed agreement in

disturbance. Upon the development of an on-line reporting system by the Department, but no later
than July 1, 2014, a VSMP authority shall be required to obtain evidence of VSMP permit
coverage where it is required prior to providing approval to begin land disturbance. The VSMP
authority shall act on any permit application within 60 days after it has been determined by the
VSMP authority to be a complete application. The VSMP authority may either issue project
approval or denial and shall provide written rationale for the denial. The VSMP authority shall act
on any permit application that has been previously disapproved within 45 days after the
application has been revised, resubmitted for approval, and deemed complete. Prior to issuance
of any approval, the VSMP authority may also require an applicant, excluding state and federal
entities, to submit a reasonable performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any
combination thereof, or such other legal arrangement acceptable to the VSMP authority, to ensure
that measures could be taken by the VSMP authority at the applicant's expense should he fail,

required of him by the permit conditions as a result of his land-disturbing activity. If the VSMP
authority takes such action upon such failure by the applicant, the VSMP authority may collect
from the applicant the difference should the amount of the reasonable cost of such action exceed
the amount of the security held. Within 60 days of the completion of the requirements of the permit
conditions, such bond, cash escrow, letter of credit, or other legal arrangement, or the
unexpended or unobligated portion thereof, shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated.
These requirements are in addition to all other provisions of law relating to the issuance of permits
and are not intended to otherwise affect the requirements for such permits.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the following activities are exempt per § 62.1-

preceding the tax year for which such taxation is sought, apply to the Commissioner of the
Revenue for the classification, assessment and taxation of such property for the next succeeding
tax year on the basis of its use, under the procedures set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3236. (In
any year in which a general reassessment is being made, such application may be submitted until
30 days have elapsed after the notice of increase in assessment is mailed or 60 days preceding
the tax year, whichever is later.).
Such application shall be on forms provided by the Department of Taxation of the commonwealth
and supplied by the Commissioner of the Revenue, and shall include such additional schedules,
photographs and drawings as may be required by the Commissioner of the Revenue. A separate
application shall be filed for each parcel on the land book. A parcel is deemed to be a separate

conveyance necessitated by governmental action or condemnation of a portion of any land
previously approved for taxation on the basis of use assessment under this division.
An application fee of $25 shall accompany each application under this section.
No application for assessment based on use shall be accepted or approved if, at the time the
application is filed, the tax on the land affected is delinquent. Upon the payment of all delinquent
taxes, including penalties and interest, the application shall be treated in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
The owner of any parcel of real estate which has been approved for special assessment as
provided for in this division shall revalidate such application annually if the continuation of such
special assessment is desired. Application for such revalidation shall be made with the
Commissioner of the Revenue at least 60 days preceding the tax year for which such taxation is
sought. No fee shall be charged for such revalidation.
Continuance of assessment based on use shall depend on continued use of the real estate in the
use for which classification was granted, continued timely payment of real estate taxes, and
compliance with other requirements of this division.
§ 27-64.3. Determination by the Commissioner of the Revenue.

The owner of any real estate liable for roll-back taxes shall, within 60 days following a change in
use, report such change to the Commissioner of the Revenue on such forms as may be

[8-8-2011]
The City has created various incentives pursuant to Virginia Code § 59.1-543 that apply to many
aspects of beginning a new business or improving or expanding an existing business in the City. The
incentives, subject to amendment without notice, are as follows:
Discounted purchase price of City-owned industrial land. The City is the owner of the undeveloped
land located in Pretlow Industrial Park. This industrial park is one of the three designated
enterprise zones. The City will offer a discount on the purchase price of land up to a maximum of
10 acres of land by a new business or existing business, provided the business makes an
investment in building improvements and machinery and tools equaling $500,000 or more as
follows with example market pricing:
Investment Range Price Per Acre
$500,000 to $1,000,000 $25,000
$1,000,001 to $5,000,000 $15,000
$5,000,001 to $10,000,000 $5,000
$10,000,001 or more $0
Building rehabilitation incentive. The City will offer an exemption from the increase in real estate
taxes for 10 years for renovations in excess of $5,000 to existing buildings over 15 years of age
with no prior improvements. The City will offer a grant equal to the initial increase in the real estate
tax related to the increase in value of renovation improvements over the value of existing
improvements before the renovation. The increased real estate taxes will be assessed and paid by
the business when complete, and the City will give a grant equal to the tax within 60 days after the
end of the fiscal year, provided no other taxes are owed to the City.
Machinery and tool tax rebate. This incentive applies to all three enterprise zones in the City. If a
new business or an existing business makes an investment in building improvements and
machinery and tools equaling a minimum of $150,000 and provides hourly employment wages at
an average of 150% of the federal minimum wage, then the City will rebate 50% of the machinery
and tools taxes paid to the City for a period of five years. The rebate will be paid annually within 60
days after the end of the fiscal year, provided no other taxes are owed to the City.
Reduced electric utility tax rebate.

zones in the City. If a new business or existing business makes an investment in building

employment for at least five people, then the City will rebate certain administrative land use
development fees normally due to the City. The rebates will be paid within 60 days after the end of
the fiscal year, provided no taxes are owed to the City and after the certificate of occupancy or
final inspection, whichever comes later, has been issued by the Director of Community
Development. Fees eligible for rebate are as follows: subdivision plat review, site plan review,
erosion and sediment control plan review, stormwater management plan review, water and sewer
connections, electric administrative connection, and all permit fees associated with the

administrative staff for up to five persons while a facility is under construction or renovation. After
three months, the normal rental fee will be charged and a signed lease will be required. If free
temporary office space is not available in the Incubator Building, then the City will assist in
searching for available short-term space for lease.
Workforce hiring and screening services. This incentive applies to all three enterprise zones in the
City. The Paul D. Camp Community College Workforce Development Center is located in the City.
Contained within the Workforce Development Center is the One-Stop Job Center. The One-Stop
Job Center will provide complimentary assistance with job posting, applicant screening and testing

business or an existing business makes an investment in building improvements and land and
machinery and tools equaling a minimum of $500,000 and creates new employment for at least 10

obtained from Franklin Southampton Economic Development as well as the Office of Community
Development. The enterprise zone administrator shall require the business to provide
documentation establishing that it has met the requirements for the receipt of local enterprise zone
incentives. Failure to provide requested documentation shall result in a denial of the application for
local incentives.
The eligible business firm must maintain all investment requirements during the incentive period,
including the number of jobs created and required wage rates. If, at any time and for whatever
reason, the business firm eliminates or reduces the required investment, the incentive will be

Except in emergency cases involving the imminent risk of pollution of the City water supply, the
Building Official shall give 10 days' written notice to the owner or occupant of the affected
premises or to a responsible agent of his intention to terminate the water service. The Building
Official shall afford to the owner, occupant or agent a hearing on the question of whether water
service shall be terminated. This hearing shall be scheduled and conducted in a manner so that,
to the maximum extent feasible, the inconvenience and burden on the owner, occupant or agent
shall be minimized. The hearing shall take place before the Building Official himself or a
designated principal assistant. The Building Official shall not terminate the water service to the
premises in question, if he finds as a fact that:
The owner, occupant or agent has presented clear, convincing and credible evidence that
there are no cross-connection hazards within the subject premises; and
No purpose of this article would be served by conducting an on-site inspection of the
premises.
In all cases, the hearing provided by this subsection shall be scheduled within the ten-day
period immediately following the giving of written notice to the owner, occupant or agent.
Upon a showing of good cause, the Building Official may grant a reasonable continuance of
the hearing so scheduled, but the Building Official nevertheless shall retain the right to
terminate the water service at the expiration of the ten-day notice period if, in his discretion,
public health considerations require such action. The Building Official shall, in all cases,
render his decision immediately after the taking of all evidence at the hearing or as soon
thereafter as may be practicable, but in no case later than 24 hours following the termination
of the taking of evidence. The Building Official shall cause his findings of fact and disposition
of the case to be reduced to writing and shall preserve the same in his files for a period of
one year. The hearing itself before the Building Official shall be tape recorded or preserved
by other appropriate means. Should the owner, occupant or agent desire a copy of the tape,
the Building Official shall cooperate with him in undertaking to reproduce the same at the
expense of the owner, occupant or agent. In all cases, the Building Official shall exercise the
utmost care to preserve the integrity of the original tape.
In emergency circumstances, where the Building Official has reasonable cause to believe that a
cross-connection hazard exists in the subject premises and such hazard jeopardizes the integrity
or the purity of the City water supply, he shall forthwith terminate the water service to the subject
premises. The Building Official shall thereafter immediately afford the owner, occupant or agent
the notice and opportunity to be heard pursuant to the procedures set forth in Subsection (b). In all
cases where the Building Official shall summarily terminate water service as provided under this
subsection, he shall act with dispatch in notifying the owner, occupant or agent and shall exercise
the utmost diligence in scheduling a prompt hearing on the matter.

prevent contamination from nonpotable liquids, solids or gases, either harmful or benign, being
introduced into the potable water supply through cross-connections or any other piping connections to
the system. This shall be accomplished by protecting every water outlet from the potable water system
which poses a possible cross-connection. Wherever such outlets cannot be protected in accordance
with the minimum air gap, a mechanical device shall be utilized to prevent backflow from

used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform
to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of
the City. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No.
9 shall apply.
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the
basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the
public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means
and discharged to the building sewer. Where basements are in existence at the time of adoption of
this article [February 10, 1986] and are connected to existing septic tanks, and in the opinion of
the City Manager it is impractical to connect by gravity to the public sewer, the basement building
drains may continue to discharge to the septic tank until such time as there is failure of the tank or
tile field, at which time the basement flow shall be lifted by approved means to the public sewer.
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains,
or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in
turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of
the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the City or the
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice
No. 9 and in accordance with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Code BOCA Basic Plumbing. All
such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. A cleanout shall be installed by the owner
at the property line.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the City Manager when the building sewer
is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be inspected and
approved by the City prior to use.

Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the City Manager they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or
any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not
be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the City Manager and shall be so located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.
In case of stoppage in the main sewer, the City shall remove the obstruction. If the stoppage
occurs in a building sewer, the City will clean the building sewer from an existing cleanout at the
property line and repair that portion of any defective sewer within the street right-of-way. Where no
building sewer cleanout exists at the property line, the City will install a cleanout at the owner's
expense.

[Ord. of 2-10-1986]
The City Manager will endeavor within reasonable limits to eliminate or remedy violation without
resorting to discontinuance of the user's discharge. However, if those informal efforts have been
unsuccessful, the City Manager is authorized to revoke the discharge permit and terminate service to a
user. The City Manager shall not revoke a discharge permit and terminate service to a user without first
delivering to the user written notice of such proposed revocation and termination. The notice shall state
the reason or reasons of the revocation and may allow a reasonable time for satisfactory compliance to
meet the wastewater constituents and/or characteristic limitation(s) that are being violated. Nothing in
this article is intended to deter, hinder or stop the City Manager from taking immediate action to
terminate service to a user when there is imminent risk or great danger to the wastewater facilities.
§ 30-87. Show-cause hearing.
[Ord. of 2-10-1986]
The City Manager may direct any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show cause
before the City Council why such discharge should not be discontinued. A notice shall be served on
the offending party, specifying the time and place of a hearing, such time to be not less than five days
from the date of the notice, to be held by the City Council regarding the violation and directing the
offending party to show cause why an order should not be issued directing the discontinuance of such
discharge. The City Council shall conduct the hearing and take the evidence. At any public hearing,
testimony taken before the City Council must be under oath and recorded. The transcript so recorded
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the
usual charges therefor. After the City Council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the
user responsible for the discharge, directing that, within a specified time period, the discharge shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment works, facilities or devices shall have been installed, or
existing treatment works, facilities or devices, if adequate, are properly operated, or such other action
is taken as the City Council may deem necessary. Any user, aggrieved by any order or other action of
the City Council, shall have a right to judicial review thereof by the circuit court having jurisdiction by an
appropriate petition to such court filed within 30 days of the date of the order of the City Council.
§ 30-88. Court proceedings.
[Ord. of 2-10-1986]
If any user discharges sewage, industrial waste or other wastes to the wastewater facilities under the
jurisdiction of the City contrary to any order of the City Council, the City may commence an action by
proceeding in the circuit court having jurisdiction where the discharging facilities are located for the
purpose of having the discharge stopped.
§ 30-89. Penalties.
[Ord. of 2-10-1986]
A violation of any provision of this article shall constitute a Class 4 misdemeanor. Each day's
continuance of such violation shall constitute a separate offense. The penalties so imposed, plus
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses of litigation, are recoverable by the City.
§ 30-90. Injunctive relief.
[Ord. of 2-10-1986]

§ 6-6. Off-site and related improvements.
[Added 3-24-2008]
A proposed subdivision or development shall be so designed as to have no appreciable
detrimental effect upon the functioning of the existing system of water, sewerage and drainage
facilities and improvements in the area. A subdivider shall provide all those improvements
necessary to ensure that the water, sewerage and drainage demands created by the subdivision
or development are properly serviced.
Where the city has established a water and sewer improvement plan and/or a drainage
improvement plan for an area having related and common water and sewer and/or drainage
conditions, and water and sewer or drainage before improvements are constructed to serve the
demands generated by subdivisions and developments within that area, each subdivider whose
project will be served by such improvements may be required as a condition of subdivision or
development approval to pay its pro rata share of the cost of providing such improvement. Such
share shall be based upon the impact which a subdivision or development has upon the rate of
flow of water, sewerage or drainage through such improvements, with such impact expressed as a
percentage of the total rate of flow such improvements are intended to serve. That percentage
shall then be applied to the total cost of designing and installing such improvements to determine
the value of the pro rata share required.
Once an improvement plan has been established for an area through the adoption of the City of
Franklin Master Water and Sewer Plan, approval of all subdivisions and developments within the
area shall be subject to the compatibility of the subdivisions or developments with such plan,
including construction and utilization of water, sewer and drainage improvements by such
subdivisions or developments in accordance with the terms of the plan.
Where a subdivider constructs such improvements designed to service other subdivisions or
developments as provided for in an established water, sewer or drainage improvement plan and
the cost of constructing such improvements exceeds the value of the subdivider's pro rata
obligations as determined by the city pursuant to this section, any subsequent subdivider utilizing
such improvements, in accordance with such plan shall reimburse the subdivider constructing
such improvements for the cost of such construction in accordance with the degree to which such
subdivider utilizes such improvements as determined by the city in accordance with the Pro Rata
Policy and Procedure.

§ 2.10. Sexually oriented businesses.
[Amended by Ord. of 6-12-2000(1)]
Intent. It is the intent of the city council to adopt regulations restricting the location and public
visibility of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect and preserve the quality of life, of its
citizens, its neighborhoods and its commercial districts based upon the following findings:
Areas where children could be expected to walk, patronize or play, such as parks and
playgrounds, should be free of such uses as being detrimental to their growth, character and
safety.
Such uses should not be located in close proximity to residential areas, because of the
possibility of such uses leading to increased levels of criminal activity in such places,
imperilment of the safety of the residents and reduction in property values.
Such uses should not be located in close proximity to churches and other religious
institutions, because they may have an adverse effect upon the attendance and ministry of
same.
Such uses should not be located in close proximity to schools or day care centers, because
they may distract children from their educational endeavors, and the presence of patrons of
such establishments may imperil the safety and welfare of children attending school or being
cared for in a day care center.
The location of more than one sexually oriented business in any particular area of the city
would have a deleterious effect upon the neighborhood, other businesses in the area and the
property values of the properties located in that area.
Definitions. For the purpose of this section the following words, terms and phrases shall have the
following meanings:

administrator determines that the applicant has failed at some previous time to comply with the
standards, conditions or terms of any previously issued zoning certificate.
The temporary use zoning certificate for a temporary use may be conditioned upon such special
requirements as the zoning administrator may determine are necessary to achieve the purposes
of this ordinance and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
A temporary use zoning certificate may be revoked if any of the provisions of this section or any of
the conditions imposed on such certificate are violated.
Subject to the specific regulations and time limits that follow and other applicable regulations of
the district in which the use is permitted, the following temporary uses are permitted with a
temporary use zoning certificate:
Sale of Christmas trees and greenery, pumpkins and other seasonal items is permitted when
operated or sponsored by charitable or civic organizations or governmental agencies in
business zoning districts; provided, however that any such use shall require the specific prior
approval of the zoning administrator on the basis of the adequacy the parcel size, parking
provisions and traffic access and the absence of undue adverse impact on other properties.
Such use shall be limited to a period not to exceed 45 days. Display of Christmas trees and

shown; provided, however that containers for construction debris may only be placed on city
streets and rights of way with the permission of the zoning administrator. A temporary use zoning
certificate is not required for such trailers. Whenever feasible, such facilities shall not be located in

it is located and shall not be located within the sight distance triangle as described in § 2.8 of this
ordinance.

ARTICLE X. B-1 Neighborhood Business District Use
Regulations
§ 10.1. Purpose of the district.
[Amended 11-26-2012 by Res. No. 2012-10]
Pursuant to the general purposes of this chapter, the intent of the B-1 neighborhood commercial district
is to provide for neighborhood commercial development primarily serving the needs of the residents
within the district and the surrounding neighborhood and related uses including those public and semipublic
uses and accessory uses as may be necessary to serve those businesses and residents. It is
also the intent of this chapter to preserve and enhance the established character of older mixed use
commercial and residential neighborhoods in the city by ensuring that infill development, as well as
redevelopment, will be consistent with the predominant existing development pattern of such
neighborhoods. The district regulations incorporate form-based provisions that are designed to
preserve the urban nature and sustainability of such neighborhoods as characterized by a mixture of
detached and attached dwellings of two stories in height with a distinct orientation to the street, and
situated on small lots with narrow yards, minimal setbacks from the streets and minimal interruption of
the street frontages by open spaces, driveways, parking areas or accessory buildings visible from the
streets. The district regulations are also intended to encourage traditional neighborhood development,
as well as improvement and efficient use of older commercial-style buildings by enabling by right and
through the conditional use permit process, mixed use developments, commercial uses that are limited
in location, type and scale and are intended to provide for the convenience of neighborhood residents
within walking distance and to avoid traffic, parking congestion, noise and other impacts that typically
result from uses that draw patrons from outside a neighborhood.

stations and convenience stores.

Development prior to approval of any subdivision plat.
The declaration shall detail how the association shall be organized and administered, how the
common areas and facilities are to be operated and maintained and how the owners of individual
properties are to be assessed for their share of operation and maintenance of the common areas
and facilities.
All common areas and facilities within a development shall be preserved for their intended
purposes as expressed in the approved master plan.
All deeds conveying interests in common open space and recreational facilities located within the

§ 15B.9. Development and Preservation of Common Areas.
All common open space and recreational facilities shall be fully improved by the Developer at a
proportionately equivalent or greater rate than the construction of residential structures and shall
be preserved for their intended purpose as expressed in the approved master plan.
All property within the PUD shall remain under single ownership of the Developer(s) until
appropriate provisions have been made that insure satisfactory operation and ongoing
maintenance of all open space, recreational and common space areas within the PUD. No
property may be leased or sold until the Director of Community Development provides written
confirmation that such provisions have been made.
§ 15B.10. Procedure to Obtain Approval of Residential Planned
Unit Development.
Any person who wishes to have property rezoned to a Residential Planned Unit Development
District shall initiate such proposed rezoning pursuant to § 28.2 of this ordinance, and if such
development involves the subdivision of land, by the concurrent submission of a preliminary
subdivision plat in accordance with § 5-2 of the subdivision ordinance.
In addition to the submissions required for rezoning and subdivision of the subject property the
applicant must submit to the Director of Community Development eight copies of a Master Plan of
the development in order for the city staff to review it and determine whether it is in compliance
with the standards set forth in this Article. The master plan shall be constituted by a site plan
submitted in accordance with Article XXIV of this ordinance and such additional data as may be
required for determining whether the plan is in compliance with the standards and provisions of
this Article.
Directors of city departments shall review the master plan and report their findings to the Director
of Community Development who, prior to consideration of the plan by the Planning Commission,
shall prepare a report, a copy of which shall be delivered to the applicant and the Planning

The planning commission shall recommend approval or disapproval of the master pl1an and the
rezoning and forward such recommendations to city council. The planning commission shall
indicate that approval of the site plan and any subdivision of property is contingent upon approval
of the master plan and rezoning by city council.
Final consideration of the master plan shall be concurrent with and a part of the consideration of
the rezoning request to city council.
In the event that city council rezones any property in the city to a residential PUD, the zoning
administrator shall indicate such designation on the official zoning map of the city.
Minor changes to or deviations from an approved master plan may be approved by the majority
vote of a Committee, consisting of the Director of Community Development, the member of the
Planning Commission and the member of City Council representing the Ward or Wards in cases
where the property is located in more that one Ward in which the PUD is located (the
"Committee"), without going through the procedure set forth in this section, if conditions arise
which merit such changes or deviations. The request for changes or deviations must be supported
by graphic and other information necessary for appropriate evaluation of the request. For the
purpose of this section, minor changes or deviations refer to changes of location and design of
buildings, other structures, streets, parking, recreation facilities, open space, landscaping or
similar details which do not materially alter the character or concept of the approved master plan.
In the event that the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that requested changes or
deviations in the master plan are something more than minor changes to, or deviations from the
master plan, the owner of the development may apply for permission to amend the approved
master plan following the same procedure as set forth in this section.
§ 15B.11. Phasing of the Planned Unit Development.
Nothing within this Article is intended to prevent the development from proceeding in stages or phases,
provided that the following conditions are met:
The proposed stages or phases will be identified and delineated in the Master Plan.
All data required for the total PUD must be provided for each phase.
Each phase must conform to the Master Plan as approved or amended.
Each stage or phase must include useable open space areas, landscaped and available for use,
approximately equivalent to the pro-rata share of the total open space approved for the PUD.
§ 15B.12. Termination of the Zoning District.
If the present, or any future, owner of the planned unit development does not comply with the
approved plans for the planned unit development, and after certification of such to the City Council
by the Zoning Administrator, the remaining undeveloped property shall revert to the underlying
zoning classification and be subject to all requirements and restrictions of the underlying district.
If development pursuant to an approved planned unit development has not begun within two (2)
years after date of approval of the plan by the City Council, the approved planned unit
development shall become null and void and the regulations of the underlying zoning district shall
be applicable to the property.
Prior to completion of the planned unit development, the owner of undeveloped portions of the
planned unit development may file with the zoning administrator a certificate of intent to
discontinue development of such undeveloped portions, stating a date after which such

ARTICLE XVI. Mobile Home Regulations
§ 16.1. Permitted mobile home location.
All residential mobile homes shall be located in a mobile home court, which has received a conditional
use permit and which conforms with the requirements of the following section. No such mobile home
outside of an approved mobile home court shall be stored, kept or used in any manner or connected to
utilities, except those mobile homes being offered for sale and not inhabited.
§ 16.2. Minimum standards for mobile home courts.
Each lot provided for the occupancy of a single mobile home unit shall have an area of not less
than 5,000 square feet and width of not less than 50 feet. No park shall be permitted an average
density of mobile home lots of more than eight per acre. Each mobile home court shall provide an

ARTICLE XVII. Cluster Zoning
§ 17.1. Intent.
The intent of this article is to allow the development of a cluster subdivision in residential zoning
districts other than R-1A general residence. It provides for a variation of lot sizes, but does not allow an
increase in the overall density that would normally be allowed in these districts. This article is intended
to: encourage the preservation of environmentally sensitive lands; prevent soil erosion by permitting
development according to the nature of the terrain and soils; provide larger open areas with greater
utility for rest and recreation; provide for natural buffer areas along streets and highways; and,
encourage more attractive and economic subdivision design.

§ 17.6. Lot area, lot width and yards.
Individual lots in a cluster subdivision shall be exempt from the minimum lot area, lot width and
yard requirements for residential districts. Side and rear yards may be reduced to zero provided
that easements or covenants establish the rights of the two abutting properties where the main
structures are to be constructed on or within five feet of a property line. Such easements or
covenants shall establish the rights of each affected owner to gain access to each owner's
structure for the purpose of performing essential maintenance and service.
Lots on the perimeter of the subdivision may be required to follow the normal lot areas, lot width
and/or yard requirements for the residential districts.
The required lot area, lot width and yards shall be as shown on the approved final subdivision plat,

of Franklin Subdivision Ordinance.
§ 17.7. Cluster subdivision density.
For a cluster subdivision, the number of lots for the entire parcel shall not exceed the number of lots
per acre permitted in the zoning district in which they are located and only net acreage may be used to
calculate the number of lots. Net acreage shall be calculated based on existing land conditions, as
specified in the following chart. Twenty percent shall be subtracted from the net acreage so calculated
to allow for street right-of-way, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the zoning
administrator that the proposed street rights-of-way will be less than 20 percent of the calculated net
acreage.

Except as otherwise provided, the number of employees shall be compiled on the basis of the
maximum number of persons employed on the premises at one time on an average day or
average night, whichever is greater. Seasonal variations in employment may be considered by the

same parking requirements, the minimum parking spaces required and maximum parking spaces
permitted shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
If circumstances justify either a reduction or increase in the number of parking spaces from the

or use served, or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, such parking
space shall be established by a recorded covenant or agreement as parking space to be used in
conjunction with the principal use and shall be reserved as such through an encumbrance on the
title of the property to be designated as required parking space such encumbrance to be valid for
the total period the use or uses for which the parking is needed are in existence.

regulations of this ordinance are satisfied. Such single family dwelling shall not be deemed to be
nonconforming.
[Amended 8-28-2006]
Any lot of official record at the time of enactment of this ordinance in the R-2 district, which is
owned separately from any adjoining property and which is at least 50 feet wide, may be used for
two-family dwellings, provided that the minimum area per family and side yard requirements set
forth in this ordinance for two-family dwellings in the R-2 district are met.
In any R district that is built up, the front yard for a new building shall not be less than the average
of the front yards on either side thereof if there are buildings on both sides and either one or both
encroaches over the front setback line but if there is a building on one side only, then the front
yard for a new building shall not be less than the front yard for the existing building if that building
encroaches over the front setback line provided that in either case no front yard in any R-district
shall be less than 15 feet in depth.
Yard measurement. Front yards, on all lots and side yards on corner lots shall be measured from
the established right-of-way line for each street as determined by the official major street plan of
the City of Franklin, except where such line may be modified or supplemented by any officially
adopted street widening or location plan of the City of Franklin or the State of Virginia, an attested
copy of which has been or may be filed with the city engineer, in which case, the latter shall
control. On streets not covered by the foregoing rule, said yards shall be measured from the
existing right-of-way line, except that for the purpose of this ordinance, no street shall be
considered as having an established right-of-way less than 50 feet wide.
Projections into yards. Architectural features may project into required yards as follows:
Cornices, canopies, eaves, chimneys or other architectural features may extend not more
than 36 inches into a front, rear or street side yard.
Terraces, decks, steps uncovered porches and landings, not more than three feet above the

conditions, may project into a side yard along an interior side lot line, up to one-fifth of the
required side yard width, but no more than three feet in any case.
Side yard variations. Variations to side yard requirements are required or allowed as follows:
On a narrow lot or record at the time of enactment of this zoning ordinance, owned separately
from any adjoining property, the side yards may be reduced in proportion to the width of the
lot, provided that no required side yard may be reduced to less than five feet except for
interior townhouse side yards.
On a corner lot which adjoins in the rear, either directly or across an alley, the side yard of
another yard in a residential district, the least width of a side yard along the side street line of
such corner lot shall be one-half of the required front yard for the lot in the rear, provided that
this exception shall not operate to reduce the buildable width of a lot of record at the time of
the enactment of this ordinance to less than 20 feet.
Any structure in the required rear yard of a corner lot which adjoins in the rear, either directly
or across an alley, the side yard of another lot in a residential district shall meet the full front

feet.
If a structure fronts or rears upon a sideyard, such sideyard shall be increased in width to at
least 20 feet, and there shall be no reduction in the rear yard.
On a lot less than 100 feet deep, of official record at the time of enactment of this ordinance and
owned separately from adjoining property to the rear, the rear yard may be reduced to 40 percent
of the lot depth, but to no less than 15 feet in any case.
Along any district boundary line, a lot in the less restricted district which sides upon such boundary
shall have a side yard equal to the side yard required in the more restricted district.
Where a court is provided for the purpose of furnishing light and air to rooms in which persons are
to live, sleep or work, except storage rooms, such court shall be an outer court, open on at least
one side and shall have at least the following dimensions:
Dwelling and other buildings in R districts, the least width shall be the sum of the heights of
building wings opposite one another or a minimum of 50 feet.
Non-dwelling structures in B or M districts, two-thirds of the sum of the heights of building
wings opposite one another or a minimum of 40 feet.
In all cases, the maximum depth shall be one and one-half times the width.
In any residential district requirements for accessory structures shall be as follows:
Accessory structures located in any part of a rear yard may not exceed 30 percent of the
areas of the required rear yard.
Accessory structures may not exceed 18 feet in height.
Accessory structures located in a rear yard shall be set back at least three feet from any rear
lot line or from any side lot line except for interior side lot lines of townhouses and at least six
feet from any alley except if such structure is more than 12 feet in height, it shall be set back
at least ten feet from any rear lot line, from any alley or from any side lot line except for
interior side lot lines of townhouses.
On a corner lot any accessory structure in the rear yard shall be set back as far away from the
adjacent street as the principal structure except that such structure in the required rear yard of
such corner lot shall observe the full front yard setback required for the lot in the rear of the
corner lot.
Accessory structures located in a front or side yard shall be set back as far from the front and
side lines as the principal structure must be.[1]

of structures set forth in the articles governing each district and to the allowable variations to the height
regulations.
§ 20.2. District area and measurement.
The aircraft approach (AA) district shall measure 1,000 feet in width at the end of the runway and
centered thereon, fanning out to a width of 4,000 feet at a distance of 10,000 feet from the end of the
runway.
§ 20.3. Height regulations.
Within the aircraft approach district, the maximum height of any building or structure shall not exceed
one percent of its distance from the end of a runway. This height restriction shall apply within a
distance of 5,000 feet of the end of the runway.
ARTICLE XXI. Floodplain Regulations
§ 21.1. General provisions.
Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of life and property, the creation of
health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the
extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the
impairment of the tax base by:
Regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in combination with other
existing or future uses, activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases in
flood heights, velocities, and frequencies.
Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within
districts subject to flooding.
Requiring all those uses, activities, and development that do occur in flood-prone districts to
be protected and/or flood proofed against flooding and flood damage.
Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazards.
Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Franklin
and identified as being in the 100-year floodplain by the Federal Insurance Administration.
Compliance and liability.
No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated,
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this article and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which
apply to uses within the City of Franklin.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of
study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
article does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district, or that land uses permitted
within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages.

This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Franklin or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any article currently in effect in floodprone
districts. However, any underlying ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent that its provisions are more restrictive than this article.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this article shall
be declared invalid for any reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions
of this article. The remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect; and for this purpose, the
provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable.
Penalties.
Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this article or
directions of the zoning officer or any other authorized employee of the City of Franklin made
pursuant thereto shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $10.00
nor more than $1,000.00. Each day that a violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense.
In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved, including an action in
equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation or, or noncompliance with this article shall not exclude the violation or
noncompliance to permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or
remedy such violations or noncompliances within a reasonable time. Any structure
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or relocated in noncompliance with this article
may be declared by the city council of the City of Franklin to be a public nuisance and
abatable as such. Flood insurance may be withheld from structures constructed in violation of
this article.
§ 21.2. Definitions.
BASE FLOOD/100-YEAR FLOOD  A flood that, on the average, is likely to occur once every 100
years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of occurring each year, although the flood may occur in any

§ 21.3. Establishment of zoning districts.
[Amended by Ord. of 7-22-2002(1)]
Description of districts.
Basis of districts. The various floodplain districts shall include areas subject to inundation by
waters of the one 100-year flood. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the
Flood Insurance Study for the City of Franklin prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated September 4, 2002.
9/11/2020 City of Franklin, VA Ecode360

(a)
The floodway district is delineated, for purposes of this article, using the criterion that
certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one 100-
year flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot
at any point. The areas included in this district are specifically defined in the abovereferenced
flood insurance study and shown on the accompanying flood boundary and
flood map or flood insurance rate map.
The flood-fringe district shall be that area of the 100-year floodplain not included in the
floodway district. The basis for the outermost boundary of the district shall be the 100-
year flood elevations contained in the flood profiles of the above-referenced flood
insurance study and as shown on the accompanying flood boundary and floodway map
or flood insurance rate map.
Overlay concept.
The floodplain districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying
districts as shown on the official zoning ordinance map, and as such, the provisions for
the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
Any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the floodplain districts and those
of any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the
floodplain districts shall apply.
In the event any provision concerning a floodplain district is declared inapplicable as a
result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying
provisions shall remain applicable.
Official zoning map. The boundaries of the floodplain districts are established as shown on the
flood boundary and floodway map and flood insurance rate map which is declared to be a part of
this article and which shall be kept on file at the office of the City of Franklin Building Official.
District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the
city council of the City of Franklin where natural or manmade changes have occurred and/or
where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for such change.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance
Administration.
Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain
districts shall be made by the zoning officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of
any of the districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The
person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so
desires.
§ 21.4. District provisions.
General provisions.
Permit required. All uses, activities, and development occurring within any floodplain district
shall be undertaken only upon the issuance of a zoning permit. Such development shall be
undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of this article and with all other
applicable codes and ordinances. Such as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code and
the City of Franklin Subdivision Ordinance. Prior to the issuance of any such permit, the
zoning officer shall require all applications to include compliance with all applicable state and
federal laws. Under no circumstances shall any use, activity, and/or development adversely

In an expansion to an existing manufacturing home park or subdivision; or
In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured
home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood;
Shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation
collapse and lateral movement.
Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of
paragraph (a)(4)a. above of this subsection shall be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation;
or

applicable codes and ordinances.
Design criteria for utilities and facilities.
Sanitary sewer facilities. All new or replacement sanitary sewer facilities and private package
sewage treatment plants (including all pumping stations and collector systems) shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharges
from the systems into the flood waters. In addition, they should be located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage and impairment.
Water facilities. All new or replacement water facilities shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and be located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damages.
Drainage facilities. All storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of surface
waters without damage to persons or property. The systems shall ensure drainage away from
buildings and onsite waste disposal sites.
The city council of the City of Franklin may require a primarily underground system to
accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less
frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans.
The facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent
properties.

Utilities. All utilities, such as gas lines, electrical and telephone systems being placed in floodprone
areas should be located, elevated (where possible), and constructed to minimize the
chance of impairment during a flooding occurrence.
Streets and sidewalks. Streets and sidewalks should be designed to minimize their potential
for increasing and aggravating the levels of flood flow. Drainage openings shall be required to
sufficiently discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
§ 21.5. Variances: Factors to be considered.
In passing upon applications for variances in the 100-year floodplain the board of zoning appeals shall
satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and
consider the following additional factors:
The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by
encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity
within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the 100-year flood elevation.
The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others.
The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent
disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owners.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in
the foreseeable future.
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for the area.
The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters
expected at the site.
The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this article.
The board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation
pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for
technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities,
and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters.
Variances in the 100-year floodplain shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has
determined that the granting of such will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in
flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense, and will not

(d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or
ordinances.
Variances in the 100-year floodplain shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has
determined that such a variance will be the minimum required to provide relief from any hardship
to the applicant.
The board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance in the 100-year floodplain in
writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the 100-year flood
elevation (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance.
A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions, including
justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances in the 100-year floodplain which are
issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administrator.
§ 21.6. Existing structures in floodplain districts.
A structure or use of a structure or premises which lawfully existed before the enactment of these
provisions, but which is not in conformity with these provisions, may be continued subject to the
following conditions:
Existing structures in the floodway district shall not be expanded or enlarged unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed expansion would not result in any increase in the 100-year
flood elevation.
Any modifications, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure
and/or use located in any floodplain area to an extent or amount of less than 50 percent of its
market value, shall be elevated and/or floodproofed to the greatest extent possible.
The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure
and/or use, regardless of its locations in a floodplain area, to an extent or amount of 50 percent or
more of its market value shall be undertaken only in full compliance with the provisions of this
article and the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code.
This ordinance shall be effective from the date of its adoption.

Council.
§ 21A.6. COA procedure.
Application for a COA shall be made by the owner of the building, structure, or land, or by the
owner's representative. If by the owner's representative, the application shall include written
authorization from the owner. Such application shall include the COA cover form produced by the
City and all required supporting information listed on the form; the form is available at City Hall or
on the City's website.
If the application consists solely of Minor Work items, as defined in § 21A.06 (j), the Commission
Secretary shall review the application within seven (7) working days of receipt and issue a COA if
the Secretary finds that the work is architecturally compatible as defined by the guidelines
approved by City Council. If the Commission secretary cannot issue a COA because the
application does not meet the Guidelines, the Commission secretary shall advise the applicant of
such and allow the applicant to revise or amend the application appropriately. If the applicant
chooses, the applicant can elect to send the original application to the Commission for review.
Any COA application for exterior alterations which are shown, through adequate documentation, to
have been approved for a tax credit under either the federal rehabilitation tax credit program or the
similar Virginia state tax credit program may also be reviewed and approved by the Commission
secretary. A completed COA application form must still be filed with any required supporting
documentation in addition to the documentation demonstrating approval for federal or Virginia
state rehabilitation tax credits for the same work. If the Commission secretary cannot issue a COA
because the application does not meet the Guidelines, the application shall be heard by the
Commission at its next hearing provided that a complete application was submitted ten (10)
business days before the next hearing, excluding the day of the hearing.

If the application includes any Major Work, the entire application shall be heard by the
Commission at its next hearing provided that a complete application was submitted ten (10)
business days before the next hearing, excluding the day of the hearing. The Commission
secretary shall place complete applications on the appropriate agenda in the order in which the
applications are received. A sign shall be posted at the property which is the subject of the
application, at least seven (7) days prior to the Commission's meeting, identifying the time, date,
place, and nature of the application which has been scheduled for a hearing.
In reviewing applications, the Commission shall employ established criteria in accordance with the
Guidelines. The Commission shall approve applications that are found to be architecturally
compatible with Historic Landmarks or Historic Overlay Zoning Districts, as defined by the
Guidelines. The Commission shall not consider interior arrangement and shall not make any
requirements except for the purpose of preventing developments that are not architecturally
compatible with Historic Landmarks or Historic Overlay Zoning Districts. Paint color shall not be
regulated.
The Commission shall either approve a COA, with or without conditions, or deny a COA within
thirty days of the first hearing of the application. The Commission shall state all reasons for
disapproval in writing. The time period for a decision on a certificate of appropriateness may be
extended by mutual agreement between the applicant and the Commission.
In the case of a denied COA application, an applicant cannot submit a substantially similar
application for the same property for one (1) year. An applicant may request a rehearing of an
application if the Commission determines that proper COA procedures were not followed.
The COA shall be a standardized form signed by the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, or Secretary
of the Commission. The COA shall state the specific exterior changes that will result from the
proposed work for which the application has been made and shall state that those changes are
approved by the Commission. A COA shall be valid for six (6) months from the date of its
issuance. If the work is not begun within six (6) and thereafter diligently pursued, a new COA shall
be obtained prior to the commencement of work.
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary repair and maintenance of any
exterior elements of any building or structure. Ordinary repair and maintenance is work done to
prevent deterioration or to replace parts of a building, structure, sign, or exterior architectural
feature with equivalent materials in order to correct any deterioration, decay of or damage to any
such building, structure, sign, or exterior architectural feature. Ordinary repair and maintenance is
work that results in no exterior change in appearance, or material.

§ 21A.8. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Commission may appeal such decision to the City
Council, provided that the appeal is filed within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the
Commission's decision, by submitting a written notice of appeal to the Zoning Administrator,
setting forth the grounds for the appeal. The appeal shall stay the decision of the Commission
pending the outcome of the appeal to the Council, except that the filing of the petition shall not
stay the decision of the City Council if the decision denies the right to raze or demolish a historic
landmark, building, or structure. The Council may consult with the Commission in relation to any
appeal and may require documentation of any Commission decision prior to hearing the appeal.
The City Council may affirm, reverse or modify the Commission's decision and shall notify the
Director of Community Development of its action.
Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the City Council may appeal to the local circuit court
by filing a petition at law, setting forth the alleged illegality of the City Council's action, within thirty
(30) days after the final decision is rendered by the City Council. The filing of the petition shall stay
the decision of the City Council pending the outcome of the appeal to the court, except that the
filing of the petition shall not stay the decision of the City Council if the decision denies the right to
raze or demolish a historic landmark, building, or structure.
In addition to the right of appeal hereinabove set forth, the owner of a historic landmark, building,
or structure, the razing or demolition of which is subject to the provisions in § 21A.5(c), shall, as a
matter of right, be entitled to raze or demolish such landmark, building, or structure provided that:
The owner has applied to the governing body for such right,
The owner has for the period of time set forth in the same schedule hereinafter contained and
at a price reasonably related to its fair market value, made a bona fide offer to sell the
landmark, building, or structure, and the land pertaining thereto, to the City or to any person,
firm, corporation, government, or agency thereof, or political subdivision or agency thereof,
which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to preserve and restore the landmark,
building, or structure and the land pertaining thereto, and
No bona fide contract, binding upon all parties thereto, shall have been executed for the sale
of any such landmark, building, or structure, and the land pertaining thereto, prior to the
expiration of the applicable time period set forth in the time schedule hereinafter contained.
Any appeal which may be taken to the court from the decision of the City Council, whether
instituted by the owner or by any other proper party, notwithstanding the provisions heretofore
stated relating to a stay of the decision appealed from shall not affect the right of the owner to
make the bona fide offer to sell referred to above. No offer to sell shall be made more than
one year after a final decision by the governing body, but thereafter the owner may renew his
request to the governing body to approve the razing or demolition of the historic landmark,
building, or structure. The time schedule for offers to sell shall be as follows: three months
when the offering price is less than $25,000; four months when the offering price is $25,000
or more but less than $40,000; five months when the offering price is $40,000 or more but
less than $55,000; six months when the offering price is $55,000 or more but less than

§ 22.1. Purpose.
It is hereby determined that the regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of
signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities without difficulty
and confusion, to prevent wasteful use of natural resources in competition among businesses for
attention, to prevent hazards to life and property, to assure the continued attractiveness of the
community, and to protect property values.
It is the purpose of this section to coordinate the type and placement of signs within the different
land use zones; to recognize the commercial communication requirements of all sectors of the
business community; to facilitate maintenance; to allow for special purpose signs; and to
guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate recordkeeping and consistent
enforcement. These things shall be accomplished by regulation of the posting, displaying,
erection, use and maintenance of signs. No sign shall be permitted as either a main or accessory
use except in accordance with the provisions of this section. It is further determined that signs
which are not lawfully erected or maintained under the provisions hereof are not consistent with
customary sign usage, are an abuse thereof, and are an unwarranted invasion of the rights of
legitimate business interests and of the public.
The regulations for signs have the following specific objectives:
To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained so that the public
safety is protected and traffic safety is maintained;
To allow and promote positive conditions for sign communication while at the same time
promoting an attractive business environment;
To reflect and support the desired character and development patterns of the Comprehensive
Plan and the various zoning districts;
To allow for adequate, effective, and aesthetic signs in commercial and industrial zones and
prevent over concentration of signage; and
To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected.
§ 22.2. In general.
Injuring, installing or removing handbills or public notices. It shall be unlawful for any person to put
up, pull down, write on, cut or otherwise injure or deface any handbill or other public notice of any
kind posted on any public bulletin board without the consent and permission of the property owner.
Affixing advertisements to trees, utility poles and street signs. No person shall in any manner affix
any advertisement, handbill or other public notice to any publicly owned tree, utility pole, traffic or
street sign or pole or in any manner injure the same. Any city employee may, at the direction of his
or her immediate supervisor, remove and discard such advertisements.
Existing nonconforming signs. Any sign valid under the laws of the State of Virginia and the City of
Franklin in place and in use prior to October 10, 1989 shall be exempt from the provisions of this
section until such time as said signage is structurally altered, enlarged, changed in shape, moved
or replaced. This exemption does not apply to window signs or portable signs in business areas.
§ 22.3. Sign standards.
Definitions and advertising permitted.

A building mounted sign is a sign which is visible from a public street or place and
which is attached to or derives its major support from a wall, roof or fence and
includes, but is not limited to, the following: an awning sign, canopy sign, marquee
sign, projecting sign, roof sign, fence sign and wall sign. Signs painted on exterior
building walls shall be considered building mounted signs. Sign area of building
mounted signs shall be measured within a continuous perimeter enclosing the entire
display face of the sign, including background, framing, trim, molding and other
borders, but excluding supports and uprights unless such supports or uprights are
designed as an integral part of the display for the purpose of illustration or attraction
or unless they are illuminated. Where a sign consists of two identical parallel faces
which are set back to back and located not more than 24 inches from each other,
only one side of such sign shall be used in computing the area. The area of signs
with more than two faces, or with faces which are not parallel or not within the same
plane with each other shall be the sum of the area of all the sign faces. The area of a
cylindrical sign shall be computed by multiplying one-half the circumference by the
height of the sign. Where individual letters, characters or figures are mounted using
a building facade as a background, the area of such sign shall be determined by
computing the sum of the area within the outer perimeter of each individual character
or figure comprising the total message, symbol or advertisement. Computational
methodology to determine sign area is set forth below this section in figures (1) and
(2).
The maximum sign area for building mounted signs shall not exceed one square foot
of building mounted sign area for each lineal foot of building frontage facing a public
street or a public access easement not to exceed a total of 100 square feet in area
facing each public street, except that no sign shall be required to be less than 15
square feet in area. For buildings housing more than one tenant, the sign area for
each tenant shall be considered separately, but the total square footage may not
exceed the standard set forth hereinabove.
The maximum sign area for building mounted signs located in the "Downtown
Service Tax District" as designated in § 27-136 of the City Code shall not
exceed two square feet of building mounted sign area for each lineal foot of
building frontage facing a public street or a public access easement not to
exceed a total of 100 square feet in area facing each public street, except that
no sign shall be required to be less than 15 square feet in area. For buildings
housing more than one tenant, the sign area for each tenant shall be considered
separately, but the total square footage may not exceed the standard set forth
hereinabove.
Where building frontage is on more than one public street or a public access
easement, the frontage on the sides of the building facing the public streets or public
access easements shall be used to calculate the permitted sign area for that
particular building front.
Where the rear of the building faces a parking lot, additional signage shall be
allowed on the rear of the building, not to exceed one square foot of building
mounted sign area for each lineal foot of building width facing the parking lot, not to
exceed a total of 100 square feet in area, except that no sign area shall be required
to be less than 15 square feet in area. For buildings housing more than one tenant,
the sign area for each tenant shall be considered separately, but the total square
footage may not exceed the standard set forth hereinabove.
In all zoning districts the maximum square footage of building mounted signs set
forth in b. and d. above may be increased by .25 square foot for each lineal foot of
building frontage in excess of one hundred (100) lineal feet.

In B-3, M-1 and M-2 zoning districts, if a building frontage facing a public street
towards which a sign is oriented is more than one hundred (100) linear feet, the
square footage area of signs may be increased as follows:
If the building is 100 feet or more but less than 150 feet from the street  an
increase of 25 percent.
If the building is 150 feet of more but less than 200 feet from the street  an
increase of 50 percent.
If the building is 200 feet of more but less than 250 feet from the street  an
increase of 75 percent.
If the building is 250 feet or more but less than 500 feet from the street  an
increase of 100 percent.
If the building is 500 feet or more but less than 1,000 feet from the street  an
increase of 150 percent.
If the building is 1,000 feet or more from the street  an increase of 200
percent.
Projecting signs and signs attached to the bottom of a marquee or roof overhang
shall not project more than five feet from the building front nor closer than two feet

signs not exceeding four feet in height and 2 1/2 feet in width may be placed on
sidewalks in front of businesses located in other than residential districts unless
approved as part of a special exception or conditional use. Such portable signs shall
not obstruct the means of egress from the building or any accessible route as
defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Such signs must be maintained in
good condition and removed each day by the close of business, in inclement
weather or in extremely windy conditions.
Flashing signs and lights outlining exteriors of a building: It shall be unlawful to erect
or maintain any lighted sign on an intermittent or flashing circuit. It is also unlawful to
outline the exterior of any buildings with lights  except during governmentally
recognized holidays, holiday seasons and city celebrations when authorized by the
zoning administrator. Time, temperature and stock quotation signs are not to be
considered flashing signs.
Revolving and/or moving signs: It shall be unlawful to erect or maintain a revolving or
otherwise moving sign.
Externally illuminated signs: Not more than two bulbs per face, which shall be white
light, shall be used to illuminate any externally illuminated sign and these bulbs shall

calendar month in business and industrial districts. The person or business erecting
or putting up such displays shall notify the zoning administrator in writing at least
three business days prior to erecting or putting up such displays on forms provided
by the department of community development. No permit or fee shall be required for
such displays. In any business or industrial district except the B-2 central commercial
district such displays shall not be erected or put up within ten feet of the public rightof-
way or in a way which is distracting to persons operating motor vehicles on public
streets. Any violation of this provision shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed
$100.00.

ARTICLE XXV. Landscaping Requirements
Division 1. In General
§ 25.1. Purpose and applicability.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
In order to enhance the general appearance and design of developments which are of prime
importance to the City of Franklin and its citizens, it is necessary to set forth standards for overall
landscape design, preservation of existing vegetation and installation of new landscaping. It is
purpose of this article:
To provide standards that, when adhered to, will enhance the appearance of developments,
streets and sidewalks in the city, while allowing for individuality, creativity, and artistic
expression in design;
To contribute to the preservation of wildlife habitat and to promote good air quality,
groundwater recharge and energy conservation, while reducing noise, glare, and excessive
heat;
To encourage and promote an appropriate balance between the built and the natural
environment;
To preserve and improve property values (public and private) through preservation of open
space, protection of existing vegetation, provision for buffers between incompatible uses and
along roadways and encouragement of the planting of new vegetation where appropriate;
To preserve and enhance the ecological and aesthetic value of property by requiring the
installation of tree canopy and other vegetation thereon;
To realize the economic and environmental value gained by the preservation of existing
vegetation and undisturbed soils;
To promote water conservation through preservation of natural areas, encouragement of good
soil management and encouragement of the use of native and/or drought tolerant plant
materials; and
To preserve topsoil by minimizing slopes and to prevent an increase in stormwater runoff from
sites subject to this article.
Application: The requirements of this article shall apply to all real property, public and private,
located in the City of Franklin for which site plan approval is required pursuant to article XXIV of
this ordinance except the following:

[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
Ten copies of landscaping plans shall be submitted for approval to the zoning administrator in
conjunction with the submission of site plans pursuant to article XXIV of this ordinance. These
plans may be developed by the applicant, a landscape architect, a civil engineer, a landscaping
company or a landscape designer, and must meet the requirements of this article.
All existing uses adjacent to the site (but excluding properties across public streets) including the
locations and sizes of street yards, buffer yards, vehicular use areas, display areas, service areas,
loading areas and any residential densities shall be clearly indicated on the landscaping plan.
For vacant properties adjacent to the site, the highest classification of permitted use as set forth in
§ 25.8 hereinbelow and allowed in the zoning district in which it is located shall be used to
determine buffer widths and heights.
Existing natural healthy trees, which are to be preserved and used for credit toward satisfaction of
the requirements of this Article, shall be clearly labeled on the landscaping plans and their
species, height, and caliper at one foot above grade shall be indicated on the plans. All trees that
are to be used for credit to meet the requirements of this article shall be at least 1 3/4 quarters to
two inches in caliper at the stated height. Methods for protecting existing trees from damage
during construction shall be shown on the landscaping plans.
It is the responsibility of the owner to maintain existing trees used for credit as set forth above and
approved new plant materials alive and in good health. All newly installed plant materials shall
conform to the latest edition of ANSI Z60.1-1996, American Standard for Nursery Stock, and any
subsequent editions as may be adopted from time to time. Any dead or missing plant materials,
which are part of the required landscaping for a site must be replaced within six months or, for
good cause shown, such extended time as permitted by the zoning administrator, or his or her
designee. Newly installed plant material shall be of locally adapted species and conform to the
planting standards established herein.

overhead utility easement or drainage easement without the written consent of the City of Franklin
or other easement holder at the time of site plan approval.
Site distance triangles. Notwithstanding the requirements of this division set forth above with
respect to plantings, no plantings shall be installed that will impair the vision of motor vehicle
operators at points where access driveways intersect public rights-of-way in keeping with the
provisions for street intersections set forth in § 2.8 of this ordinance.
Pruning of trees. Care should be taken that trees not be topped or excessively pruned. In the
event that excessive pruning results in a tree or trees deviating from it or their natural pattern of
growth, as determined by the zoning administrator, the owner has a duty to replace such tree(s).

Division 3. Landscaping of Vehicular Use Areas
§ 25.11. Intent.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
The intent of this division is to ensure attractive views of vehicular use areas such as parking lots,
driveways, loading and service areas, utility service areas and utility devices from streets and adjacent
properties by screening such areas from adjacent properties and public rights-of-way; by moderating
temperatures of impervious areas, by abating glare from parking lots or service areas and by helping to
filter vehicular exhaust. This division specifies minimum requirements and design standards while
allowing flexibility in design.
§ 25.12. Definition.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
Vehicular use areas are areas in which motor vehicles are either stored or driven, including private
access driveways, parking lots containing more than five parking spaces, vehicular display lots
(vehicles for sale, rent, or lease), loading and service areas, utility service areas and utility devices,
including, but not limited to, electrical substations, electrical transformers and pumping stations.
Portions of interior vehicular use drives with no parking spaces on either side or used exclusively as
access to loading and service areas are excluded from this definition.

§ 25.13. Vehicular use areas adjacent to buffer areas.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
Where vehicular use areas are located adjacent to required buffer areas, the required buffer area
landscaping as set forth in division 2 above counts toward satisfying the planting requirements for the
vehicular use area.
§ 25.14. Vehicular use area landscaping requirements.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
Design standards for parking lots are as follows:
All parking lots must have at least one canopy tree at least eight feet in height and 1 3/4 to
two inches in caliper measured one foot above grade when planted with an expected mature
height of 35 feet or more within 60 feet of each parking place or two small trees and/or large
tree-form shrubs instead of one canopy tree, if overhead utility lines will impair the canopy
tree's growth to maturity, the midpoint between said trees being within 60 feet of each parking
space.
Existing trees. Existing health canopy trees, meeting the size requirements set forth in 1.
above, may be counted toward the requirements of this section, provided that tree protection
methods are installed at least six feet from the trunks of existing trees or groupings of trees or
one foot for each one inch in caliper for each tree or grouping of trees to be retained and
maintained in a healthy growing condition before, during and after development of the site.
Landscape areas for parking lots may be provided in islands located at the ends of rows of
parking spaces, in medians located between rows of parking bays or adjacent to and within
ten feet of the perimeter of the parking lot.
All planting medians and islands in parking lots shall be at least seven feet wide, measured
from the back of each curb and must contain at least 300 square feet for each canopy tree or
two small substitute trees. Median planting strips between rows of parking bays are
encouraged rather than numerous small, one tree islands. If medians are used, the distance
of parking spaces from the trunk of a canopy tree or two small substitute trees may be
increased to 75 feet as long as the trees planted in the medians are spaced no further than 50
feet on center.
All parking lots within 20 feet from the street or any adjacent property will be screened from
the right of way and any adjacent properties by evergreen plantings that will attain a height of
at least three feet within three years, planted no more than six linear feet apart.
Opaque fences or walls, at least 60 inches in height and architecturally compatible with the
principal on-site building in construction and color., may be substituted for a maximum of 50
percent of the required shrubs to screen parking lots from adjacent properties when located
within 20 feet of such properties.
Berms may be installed within the area between parking lots and street rights-of-way with a
minimum height of 1 1/2 feet, minimum crown width of two feet, and side slopes no greater
than 3:1 ratio. Berms shall be planted with shrubs which may be lower than 18 inches in
height when installed, but berms and shrubs must achieve a minimum combined height of
three feet within three years.
All parking lots shall provide landscaped areas equivalent to at least eight percent of the
paved area of the lot.

Design standards for loading and service areas are as follows:
All loading and service areas, including trash collection areas or dumpster refuse containers, when
not screened by an intervening building or other structure, shall be screened from adjacent
properties and streets by evergreen plant materials which can be expected to reach a height of six
feet or greater within three years of installation or by opaque fences or walls at least six feet in
height and architecturally compatible with the principal on-site building in construction and color.
Designs standards for utility service areas and utility devices are as follows:
Any utility service area or utility device located within 20 feet of a public right-of-way and more
than 36 inches in height shall be screened from the public right-of-way, which screening may not
intrude into the public right-of-way. Screening shall be by evergreen plantings a minimum of 18
inches in height when installed and expected to reach a mature height and width equal to, or
greater than, the utility service area or utility device, including, but not limited to, electrical
substations, electrical transformers and pumping stations to be screened. Screening shall be
accomplished in such a manner as to allow safe operation and access to the utility service area or
utility device.
Design standards for parking structures are as follows:
When parking is provided in above or below ground structures, the above requirements for parking
lots shall not apply. However, if the parking structure is visible from a street right-of-way or
adjacent property, one deciduous or evergreen canopy tree at least eight feet in height and 1 3/4
to two inches in caliper measured one foot above grade when planted with an expected mature
height of 35 feet or more or two deciduous or evergreen substitute trees for every 25 linear feet of
the structure shall be planted between the structure and the adjacent property or right-of-way.
Design standards for vehicle display lots are as follows:
Where vehicle display lots are located within 20 feet of a street right-of-way, one canopy tree as
defined in § 25.16(d) or two small trees per 50 linear feet and one evergreen shrub for every six
lineal feet of street frontage shall be installed. Trees and shrubs may be grouped together to
enhance design elements.
Division 4. Street Yard Landscaping
§ 25.15. Intent.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
This division is intended to establish a landscaped area adjacent and parallel to any public street rightof-
way. This street yard shall be planted with live, healthy trees to provide a pleasing appearance, a
continuity of vegetation, a reduction in impervious surfaces, a reduction in stormwater runoff,
improvements in air quality and increased shaded areas.
§ 25.16. Street yard design standards.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
Generally. Street yards shall be landscaped with live vegetation and maintained by the property
owner. Such landscaping may be used to help satisfy the requirements for buffer areas (division 2)
and vehicular use area landscaping (division 3).
Impervious surfaces. Access driveways shall cross the street yard as near to a 90-degree angle
as is practical given the shape and topography of the property. No other impervious surfaces may
be used in calculating the street yard area requirements.

Tree quantity. Street yards shall contain at least one canopy tree for every 50 linear feet of street
yard, or fraction thereof, for the entire frontage of the site. Trees may be grouped together to
enhance the appearance of the site and enhance the design of the landscaping, but no trees shall
be installed closer than ten feet on center. No more than 25 percent of the required trees shall be
evergreen.
Tree size. Trees shall be a minimum of 1 3/4 to two inches in caliper measured one foot above
grade and a minimum of eight feet in height at installation and shall be expected to achieve a
minimum height of 35 feet at maturity unless the canopy of such a tree will be impaired by utility
lines, in which case two small trees may be substituted therefor.
Existing trees. Existing trees may be used to satisfy the requirements for street yard planting,
provided that these trees meet the size requirements of subsection (d) above and are maintained
in a healthy growing condition before, during and after development of the site.
Street yard width and area requirements. All new developments shall provide a street yard that
averages at least ten feet in width and is no less than six feet in width at any point along its street
frontage as measured perpendicularly to the public street right-of-way. The minimum area of the
street yard in square feet shall be equal to the length of the property along the right-of-way in
linear feet times ten. Street yard widths in excess of 20 feet shall not be calculated in determining
the minimum area. Access drives are excluded in calculating the length of the street yard.
Division 5. Interpretation and Modification of Requirements
§ 25.17. Interpretation and modification of requirements.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-22, 8-23-2004]
The zoning administration shall interpret the requirements of this article and may allow modification of
the requirements for buffer areas, vehicular use areas and street yards in keeping with the purpose
and intent of this article under the following circumstances:
The site is exceptionally narrow or shallow, has an odd size, shape or topography or is otherwise
unusual in physical dimension.
There exists a unique relationship to adjacent properties or properties in the general vicinity.
The transfer of right-of-way to the city for proposed or future street widening severely limits the
size and use of the property.
ARTICLE XXVI. Administration
§ 26.1. Duties of zoning administrator.
It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator, or his designee, with the aid of the police department, to
administer and enforce the ordinance in accordance with its administrative provisions. For this
purpose, and in order to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate any violation hereof, such person is hereby
authorized to institute, through authorized legal counsel, any appropriate legal action necessary for the
purpose.

2208 and 15.2-2209, as amended, shall also apply.
ARTICLE XXVII. Board of Zoning Appeals
§ 27.1. Creation of board.
[Amended by Ord. of 7-10-1995(4)]
The circuit court of Southampton County is hereby requested to appoint a board of zoning appeals for
the City of Franklin consisting of seven residents of the city in accordance with Code of Virginia,
§ 15.2-2308. Such board shall organize itself, adopt rules of procedure, hold meetings, keep records,
and exercise its general powers and duties, all as prescribed in Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2308 et seq.
The board may call upon any city officer or department for information or assistance in the
performance of its duties, and such officer or department shall render such assistance as may
reasonably be required.
§ 27.2. Powers of the board.
[Amended by Ord. No. 2004-18, 6-28-2004]
In accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2309 et seq., the powers of the board shall be as follows:
Administrative review. The board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an
administrative official or zoning administrator in the administration and enforcement of this
ordinance.
Variances. The board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal or original application in
specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public
interest, when owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance
will result in unnecessary hardship provided that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and
substantial justice done, as follows:
When a property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith and where by
reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of
property at the time of the effective date of the ordinance, or where by reason of exceptional

topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property,
or of the condition, situation, or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the
strict application of the terms of the ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property or where the board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard
by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship
approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by
the applicant, provided that all variance shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and
purpose of the ordinance.
No grant of variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation
of the property concerned is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably

[Amended by Ord. of 2-25-2002(2)]
The board shall have the power to hear and decide applications for conditional use permits as
may be authorized in this ordinance.
In considering an application for a conditional use permit, the board shall determine the
appropriateness of the application based upon the following standards:
The use is compatible with the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood by
virtue of its height, bulk, location on site and the design and location of parking, signage,
landscaping and other outside activities or structures.
The use does not create a demand on public water or sanitary sewer services that exceeds
the design capacity of those systems at the proposed site or that would in any way decrease
the quality of service to the surrounding neighborhood.
The use does not generate traffic or parking on public streets that exceeds the design
capacity of said streets and does not create a dangerous traffic problem by virtue of driveway
location, site clearance, driveway slope or other factors.
The use does not increase the flood potential in the surrounding neighborhood.
The use is in conformance with the setback, yard, frontage, lot area, parking, signage,
screening and any other applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance as they pertain to
the district in which the use is to be located or to the specific use.
The use does not adversely affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood.

The use is not detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property and
improvements in the neighborhood.
The use is not in conflict with the comprehensive plan and complies with all applicable
federal, state and local laws.
The board may approve or disapprove the permit based upon its determination as to whether or
not the use is in keeping with the standards set forth hereinabove in subsection (b) or can be
made compliant therewith by the imposition of conditions on the permit. In the event that the board
determines that conditions are required for compliance with the above standards, it may condition
the granting of the permit on adherence to conditions with respect to the location, construction,
maintenance or operation of the use.
The board may limit the duration of a permit and may require a guarantee or bond to ensure that
the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with.
Construction or operation of the conditional use shall commence within one year of the issuance
of the permit, except that the zoning administrator may extend this period for up to one more year
upon the administrator's determination in his or her sole discretion that additional time is
reasonably needed to complete the construction or commence operations. If after the permit is
issued and the use for which the permit is issued is discontinued for a period of more than one
year, the permit shall become void.
The board shall also have the power to revoke a conditional use permit if it determines that there
has not been compliance with the terms or conditions of the permit. No conditional use permit
shall be revoked except after notice and hearing as provided by Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204.

§ 28.7. Conditional zoning.
[Amended 1-8-2007]
Conditional zoning authorized. Whenever it appears that the zoning methods and procedures
provided for elsewhere in this ordinance may prove to be inadequate in regard to a particular
zoning reclassification, and when a more flexible and adoptable zoning method is deemed
necessary, amendments to this ordinance may be allowed subject to certain conditions proffered
by the zoning applicant for the protection of the city that are not generally applicable to land
similarly zoned.
Proffer of conditions. Proposed rezonings may include the voluntary proffering in writing by the
property owner of reasonable conditions to attach to the rezoning of his property in addition to the
regulations already provided for in the applicable zoning district, provided that:
The rezoning itself must give rise to the need for the conditions.
Such conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning.
Such conditions shall not include mandatory dedication of real or personal property for open
space, parks, schools, fire departments or other public facilities not otherwise provided for by
the subdivision ordinance of this city (Appendix C).
Reasonable conditions may include the payment of cash for any off-site road improvement or
any off-site transportation improvement that is adopted as an amendment to the required
comprehensive plan and incorporated into the capital improvements program.
All such conditions shall be in conformity with the comprehensive plan of the city.
Once proffered and accepted as part of an amendment to the zoning ordinance, such
conditions shall continue in full force and effect until a subsequent amendment changes the

zoning on the property covered by the conditions; provided, however, that such conditions
shall continue if the subsequent amendment is part of a comprehensive implementation of a
new or substantially revised zoning ordinance.
The planning commission and the city council may approve permitted conditional uses as a
part of a conditional rezoning.
[Added 11-26-2012 by Res. No. 2012-11]
Time of proffer. All written proffers shall be filed with the application for rezoning. City Council may
accept amended proffers once a public hearing has begun if the amended proffers do not
materially affect the overall proposal.
Enforcement, guarantees and administration of conditions.
The zoning administrator shall administer and enforce conditions attached to a rezoning
including:
The ordering in writing of the remedy of any noncompliance with such conditions;
The referral of any noncompliance to the city attorney with a request for appropriate legal
action to ensure compliance with such conditions including injunction, abatement or other
appropriate action or proceedings; and
Requiring a guarantee, satisfactory to the city council, in an amount sufficient for and
conditional upon the construction of any physical improvements required by the
conditions, or a contract for the construction of such improvements and the contractor's
guarantee in like amount so conditioned, which guarantee shall be reduced or released
by the city council, or agent thereof, upon the submission of satisfactory evidence that
construction of such improvements has been completed in whole or in part.
Failure to meet any and all conditions imposed as a condition of rezoning shall constitute
cause to deny the issuance of any of the required use, occupancy or building permits, as may
be appropriate.
Any zoning applicant who is aggrieved by a decision of the zoning administrator pursuant to
the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection may petition the board of zoning appeals for
a review of the decision of the zoning administrator.
Records. The zoning map shall show by an appropriate symbol on the map the existence of
conditions attaching to the zoning on the map. The zoning administrator shall keep in his office
and make available for public inspection a conditional zoning index. The index shall provide ready
access to the ordinance creating conditions in addition to the regulations provided for in a
particular zoning district.
Substantial conformity. Upon approval of an application and proffered conditions, any site plan,
subdivision plat or development plan thereafter submitted for the development of the property in
question shall be in substantial conformity with all proffered statements, plans, profiles, elevations
or other demonstrative materials and no development shall be approved by any city official in the
absence of such substantial conformity. For the purpose of this subsection "substantial conformity"
means that level of conformity which leaves a reasonable margin for adjustment due to final
engineering data but which conforms with the general nature of the development, the specific uses
and the general layout depicted by the plans, profiles, elevations and other demonstrative
materials presented by the applicant.
Amendments and variations of conditions. There shall be no amendment or variation of conditions
created pursuant to the provisions of subsection 28.7(b) until after public hearings before the
planning commission and city council advertised pursuant to the provisions of Code of Virginia,
§ 15.2-2204.

MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT
Mixed use development is intended as an improvement over traditional segregated-use zoning. It
derives from a positive vision of a more desirable community. A mixed-used development must be
one in that the purpose is to spur community revitalization, increase affordable housing
opportunities, promote pedestrian and bicycle travel, reduce auto dependency, roadway
congestion, and air pollution by co-locating multiple destinations, promote a sense of community
and promote efficient use of land and infrastructure. Permitted uses, residential housing unit
considerations, densities and dimensional requirements are listed in A B, and C below:
Uses Permitted by special exception within the mixed  use development:
Museums, cultural and/or social community facilities.
Public parks, playgrounds and community centers.
Research and development.
Business and professional offices.
Child/Adult day care facilities.
Retail sales and services.
Restaurant.
Personal services.
Indoor and outdoor recreational facilities.
Residential housing units.
Any principal use permitted in the B-2 district, which in the opinion of the board of
appeals, and under such conditions as it may determine, will not be detrimental to other
uses permitted in the B-1 district.
Residential housing units in a mixed use development: Residential housing units of various
types may be included in a mixed-used development and contribute to mixed-use character of
the district as a whole. To qualify for a residential housing unit component within a mixed-use
development the applicant must integrate dwelling units with a proposed commercial
development. Integration may be achieved by one or both of the following methods:
Locating housing units above the ground floor of a commercial building, i.e., an
accessory dwelling in a structure occupied principally for commercial uses.
Constructing separate or attached residential housing units on the same lot provided they
are located behind or to the side of a commercial development such that the commercial
development would be the major structure seen from the street.
Density and Dimensional Rules: The following density and dimensional rules shall apply to
multi-family housing within a mixed  use development:
No more than 50% of the gross floor area of the primary structures that contribute to the
mixed area of a proposed mixed use development shall be used for multi-family dwelling
units.
MOTEL, MOTOR COURT, MOTOR HOTEL or MOTOR LODGE
